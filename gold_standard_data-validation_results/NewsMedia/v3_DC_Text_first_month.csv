black mark commanding officer record military still fairly zero-defect otoh armed fort hood type shooter going get far maybe killing two people instead twenty going black mark commander record either way plus odds shooting astonishingly rare let people carry loaded weapons take heat one screws mandate gun-free zone everyone mps/sps/security police etc… avoid potential set screw-ups much worse time alexises world show probably happen stint command billet going get black mark record either way looking way military policy towards personal weapons surprising related version probably liability insurers would shit bricks proposed allowing employees chls carry work anyone better solution stopping shitheads like alexis committing crimes like banning shotguns though guess navy yard could stand improve security tad dude able slip db said yesterday 870 past guard station guns mexico come us directly come mexican armories supplied guns government funneled criminals also little issue many deaths ciudad juarez probably caused occupying army mexicans sent mexican government help supply drug lords loss sale firearms sending army actually supply drug lords ready willing enforcers moonlight drug lords cartels known paid several former u.s. army operatives work hit men getting comparatively well u.s. soldiers job imagine kind corruption expect mexican soldiers actually living city run cartels call military article operatives stretch imagination 1 noted conscripts 2 nothing allowed carry weapon 3 anyone walking around anything value make nice targets theft therefore must require trained soldiers shot death convinced convinced implement useless absurd counterproductive policies goodness think might makings fine flag officer folks well know long could sustain career based entirely offhand sarcastic quips country needs me… tarran give us reasons issuing weapon soldier getting truck hot zone none specific military bases one least theft seems particularly inapt security
