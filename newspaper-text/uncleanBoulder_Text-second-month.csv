1,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/22/others-say-strengthen-red-flag-laws/,"Brandon Hole’s ability to acquire guns so easily after he had been deemed by police too dangerous to possess a weapon speaks to many levels of failure. Law enforcement failed to take steps under Indiana’s red-flag law to prevent him from purchasing new weapons after they had confiscated one gun. The law itself is too limited in who can petition the court for suspension of someone’s right to own a gun. And lawmakers, primarily Republican members of Congress, refuse to recognize that no one, least of all a troubled 19-year-old, should have access to assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that are designed to kill quickly, brutally and in large numbers. As investigation into last week’s mass shooting continues, details of how the state’s red-flag law might have been used to prevent the rampage have only added to the grief of a community mourning the senseless loss of lives. In 2005, Indiana became one of the first states to enact legislation that allows authorities to temporarily take guns away from people found by a judge to pose a danger to themselves or others. In principle, it should have stopped Hole. In March 2020, when he was 18, his mother reported his suicidal tendencies to police, and they confiscated a brand new shotgun. The law requires that once police take a weapon, prosecutors have 14 days to justify the seizure to a judge. A person deemed unstable by the court would be barred from possessing any guns for at least six months. But prosecutors didn’t pursue the matter, and months later, Hole bought the two assault weapons. Prosecutors have since said that because Hole surrendered the gun and committed no violent act, they had no reason to pursue the matter. They also complained that the law’s two-week turnaround is too short to conduct an investigation and that they are handicapped by their inability to get an individual’s medical records. No, red-flag laws alone would not prevent all firearm-related deaths, but they would help. So would universal and more rigorous background checks. So would a ban on the assault-style weapons that enabled Hole—and the countless mass murderers who preceded him—to kill with speed and efficiency. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

2,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/649771086/0/indystar/allnews~Exclusive-Mayor-Hogsett-discusses-Indianapolis-rise-in-violence-after-rd-mass-shooting/,"Indianapolis has been here before. The shooting at a FedEx facility on April 15 that left eight people dead is the third mass shooting the city has experienced this year alone — and its deadliest one in at least 15 years. The massacre follows an unprecedented year of homicides and a year-over-year rise in such violence that has left the public increasingly frustrated as they look to city leaders for solutions. But now it's not just residents looking for answers. The shooting at FedEx put Mayor Joe Hogsett and the city in the national spotlight, with people everywhere asking: How does this keep happening? Hogsett and other city leaders have noted that Indianapolis has pumped millions in crime prevention and violence reduction programs. It has launched a new Community Justice Campus that rethinks criminal justice and features an Assessment and Intervention Center to assist those struggling with mental health issues. Officials have even touted its Gun Crime Intelligence Center, focused on confiscating illegal weapons. But despite those efforts, the violence has only increased, and the latest mass shooting has raised even more perplexing questions. Authorities last week revealed that the mother of the alleged shooter, 19-year-old Brandon Hole, called authorities in March 2020 over worries that he might try to kill himself through “suicide by cop.” Police seized a shotgun from Hole at the time. But just months later, Hole legally bought the two assault rifles that would be used in the shooting at FedEx. The IndyStar spoke one-on-one with Hogsett on Wednesday to get his thoughts on what led up to the shooting at FedEx, how he thinks gun laws should change, and whether the city’s efforts to reduce violence are working. There’s little that Indianapolis can do to enact gun reform measures, Hogsett emphasized. That’s why working with the state and federal government is key. “I think that the federal government has an important role to play,” Hogsett said. “And so from a local perspective, I want to continue to advocate to our representatives in Washington, both in the House and in the Senate for common sense gun laws. Closing loopholes and tightening up background checks in ways that I think could meaningfully adjust people's access to gun ownership.” Then there’s the state legislature, which has consistently passed laws limiting the powers of cities such as Indianapolis. Cities, for instance, are prohibited from regulating firearms. They are also not allowed to use public funds to establish a buyback program in which guns are purchased from individual owners to keep them out of public circulation. “This is not something that, in certain circumstances, our hands are tied — I would posit that our hands are tied in every and all circumstances,” Hogsett said. “That if the council would produce an ordinance that would provide more restrictive responsibilities on citizens that happened to be more restrictive than state law, then that ordinance would be struck down as having been preempted by state law. “I'm not saying that to say, ‘Okay, well, we just throw up our hands and do nothing,’” Hogsett added. “But what it requires us to do is to convince the Indiana General Assembly to do something.” Asked whether Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears made the right decision for not following through with red flag law proceedings after Hole’s gun was seized in March 2020, Hogsett said it’s not his job to criticize the prosecutor. Indiana’s red flag law allows police to seize guns from people who are deemed a danger to themselves or others. The gun owner has to petition a court to get the gun back, but prosecutors can ask the judge to issue an order that would withhold the seized weapon and prevent the person from purchasing new guns for at least a year. For subscribers: Marion County Prosecutor Mears criticized for not using red flag law against FedEx killer Mears said he didn't pursue red flag proceedings in Hole's case in part because the law only gives prosecutors 14 days to prove their case to a judge, but it takes up to 30 days to obtain medical records, including mental health history. Mears has advocated for expanding that timeframe to allow prosecutors to prepare their cases properly. The mayor said he generally supports measures that would “tighten alert systems” like the red flag law, but questions whether expanding the window for a judge to sign an order is the right move, noting a person can still legally buy guns while a judge considers a petition. Hogsett said ""allowing a prosecutor's office to have a greater amount of time may very well be inviting a greater amount of capacity for one to go out and buy guns illegally before a determination is made. So how we change the red flag laws so that they are more effective, I would defer to those who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing them. ""But I'm in full support of doing whatever we need to do to make sure that guns stay out of the hands of people who have no business possessing them."" Indianapolis is on pace to break its record for homicides in a single year. The city saw a staggering 215 criminal homicides in 2020, a 40% increase from the year prior. As of Wednesday, the city reported 72 criminal homicides for the year, up from 46 the same time last year. That's a difference of 26 victims, or a 44% increase. Hogsett pointed out that the city's three mass shootings have accounted for 18 victims, including an unborn child when the mother was killed. The year's first two mass shootings — first on Adams Street and then on Randolph Street — involved inter-family and domestic partner disputes, Hogsett added. ""I cannot literally put a police officer in every home in Indianapolis to try to stem the tide, the rising tide of domestic violence that's taking place,"" Hogsett said. ""But my point is that if we had been able to meaningfully change the trajectory of those three instances, we would as a city be kind of where we were last year, which I want to underscore is not acceptable. ""But also... it really does I think magnify the questions that you have, and the need that the city has in identifying, whenever possible, these incidences where mass shootings take place, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them prospectively."" When pressed about the continued rise in homicides in Indianapolis, Hogsett noted that violence started increasing before he took office in 2016. The number of homicides has risen every year since 2012, with the exception of a small drop in 2019. ""At the end of the day, we're just simply trying to do and are willing to try to do anything and everything that we possibly can to stem the rising tide of gun violence in Indianapolis."" Indianapolis has launched a myriad of programs to deal with crime. The city’s crime prevention grants — its largest crime grant initiative — has been ongoing for 10 years. Its violence reduction grant program launched in 2018. Reports about the efficacy of such grant programs are inconclusive. Meanwhile, the city last year celebrated the opening of its Assessment and Intervention Center on the up-and-coming new Community Justice Campus. Some would argue the efforts are not enough. Hogsett disagrees. “I'm not altogether sure that it's fair to say that some of these things aren't working,” he said.  “I mean I think that there is a strategy that the city has of long-term intervention and short-term intervention, and obviously in the short run, I think having a violence reduction team on the ground, identifying those who are most likely to become victims or perpetrators of violence is an important short-term intervention.” But investments the city is making in broader criminal justice reform, including increasing access to mental health services and launching a new division to address food insecurity, are long-term interventions, Hogsett said. Such efforts, city officials have said, will take time. “I feel strongly that the administration is laying the groundwork and has been laying the groundwork for the future of public safety in Indianapolis,” Hogsett said.

4,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/04/22/da-persuades-orange-police-to-not-release-video-from-last-months-mass-shooting/,"Trending: Orange police on Wednesday, April 21, hastily called a press conference to release body-camera footage, 911 calls and other information about the mass shooting that left four dead last month – but instead told the gathered reporters that it was changing course after a request from District Attorney Todd Spitzer. Dozens of reporters, photographers and police personnel waited at police headquarters for more than an hour for the release of information new to the public before Lt. Jennifer Amat made a brief statement saying the district attorney had advised against releasing a video about the case for fear it would hurt court proceedings. “We had intended on releasing body-worn camera footage from the initial officers who responded to the scene,” Amat said. “However, moments ago the Orange County district attorney, Todd Spitzer, notified our team that the release of this video may impact the successful criminal prosecution of this case. “As you know, justice for the victims and their families is our top priority,” she said. In a Wednesday letter to Orange Police Chief Thomas Kisela, Spitzer mentions that the law generally requires the public release of body-worn camera footage, but he wrote that there are exceptions. “It has come to my attention that your Police Department has prepared an approximately nine-minute Critical Incident Video it intends on releasing to the public in the near future,” Spitzer said in the letter. “I am writing to respectfully implore you to not release this video at this time. … “It is my understanding that this Critical Incident Video contains portions of two 911 calls, details of items found in the defendant’s possession, and body-worn camera footage in which numerous gunshots are heard and the officer-involved shooting is captured,” the letter says. Spitzer, in an phone interview on Wednesday, said he took “full responsibility” for what happened, adding that he should have communicated with the Orange Police Department earlier about the potential release of the footage. Spitzer acknowledged the need for transparency, but noted that there are still active investigations into both the killings and the police’s shooting of the alleged killer. The DA added that the accused shooter has yet to make his first court appearance in connection to the killings, and that prosecutors have yet to talk with family members of the victims. “This is still early and there are substantial moving parts,” Spitzer said. Assistant Public Defender Ken Morrison, who is representing accused shooter Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, said he was concerned when he learned about the potential public release of the footage. Morrison said he was “gratified that Mr. Spitzer shares those concerns,” and said the DA “did the right thing” in asking that the footage not be released. “I would just like to remind everyone that we need to remain careful that the investigation, prosecution and defense of this horrible tragic shooting that has impacted so many lives not be treated as a political event by the police, the District Attorney’s Office or my own office,” Morrison said. Morrison said the defense team has yet to receive the body-camera footage. He added that such potential evidence should be provided to the defense team first before being publicly released.  Meanwhile, Gonzalez remains hospitalized and unable to communicate, forcing his initial court appearance to continually be delayed; a court hearing is held each weekday to assess his ability to communicate. The proceeding was once again delayed on Wednesday, when attorneys said he was still unable to fully express himself. On the evening of March 31, a Wednesday, police said that his rampage that left four dead and one woman in critical condition stemmed from personal and business relationships that Gonzalez, 44, had with the victims. Gonzalez entered the office building on West Lincoln Avenue that held Unified Homes, a real estate business, police said, and opened fire. Authorities said that Gonzalez was shot and wounded but killed Luis Tovar, 50; Tovar’s daughter Jenevieve Raygoza, 28; longtime employee Leticia Solis Guzman, 58; and 9-year-old Matthew Farias. Matthew’s mother, Blanca Tamayo, was critically wounded. Police found a backpack they say they believe belonged to Gonzalez. Inside was pepper spray, handcuffs and ammunition. He had secured the gates with bicycle cable locks, police said, delaying responding officers’ entry. Gonzalez faces four counts of special-circumstances murder among other charges. Spitzer has repeatedly said he will not be rushed into deciding whether to pursue capital punishment. Spitzer has also continually brought up the mistakes that occurred under the watch of his predecessor, former DA Tony Rackauckas, regarding the prosecution of Seal Beach shooter Scott Dekraai, who nearly a decade ago carried out the county’s last mass shooting, killing eight people. A judge ended up taking the death penalty off of the table in the Dekraai case because of prosecutorial misconduct. “I’m not going to give the defense one inch to argue errors in this case or jeopardize justice in this case,” Spitzer said.

7,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/43-new-charges-filed-against-suspect-colorado-supermarket-mass-shooting-n1264921," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Colorado prosecutors filed 43 new criminal charges Wednesday against the man suspected of gunning down 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket. Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 22, had originally been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder before prosecutors filed an amended complaint stemming from the March 22 mass shooting at a King Soopers in Boulder. He's now facing a 54-count complaint that includes 10 counts of first-degree murder, 33 counts of attempted murder, one count of first-degree assault and 10 counts of using a prohibited large-capacity magazine while committing a crime. Conviction for first-degree murder carries a maximum of life in prison without the possibility of parole, Boulder DA Michael Dougherty told reporters on Thursday. “We’re going to work as hard as we possibly can to reach the right outcome and to insure the shooters is held fully accountable,"" he said. The prosecutor said investigators still don't have a grasp on what might have motivated the shooter. “I understand the community and certainly the victims’ families want to know why that King Soocpers and why Boulder?” Dougherty said. “I know that in other mass shootings that have taken place across the United States, there've been times when they’ve been unable to ever identify a motive. And you don’t need motive to prove that someone acted with intent and after deliberation in court. But if our community and especially for those families, they want to know why. So we’re going to keep working as hard as we can to uncover that.” The murder charges were listed in order investigators believe they were killed by Alissa. The 10th murder count stems from the fatal shooting of Boulder Police Officer Eric Talley, who was the final victim, according to Dougherty. Talley, 51, had been the first officer to arrive at the King Soopers. He was father of seven and an 11-year veteran of the Boulder police force. The other victims were Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Teri Leiker, 51; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. The new criminal complaint also listed the alleged targets of Alissa's gunfire. They include Patrick Kruse, Angela Peacock, James Graham, Kelly Rae Dorr, Sarah Moonshadow, Nick Edwards and Christopher Tatum. The court document also named officers who were allegedly fired upon by Alissa, and they include Bryan Capobianco, Pam Gignac, Richard Steidell, Bryan Plyter, Alexander Kicera, Jenny Schmeits, R.J. ""Richard"" Smith, Brandon Braun, Michael West, Jeffrey Brunkow and Samuel Kilburn. Capobianco and Gignac were with Talley and among the first three Boulder police officers to face the shooter, Dougherty said. ""Less than 30 seconds after Officer Talley was shot and killed and the two other officers were victims of attempted murder, a second wave of officers then engaged and went into King Soopers,"" Dougherty said. The first-degree assault charge against Alissa stems from the ""serious bodily injury"" suffered by Elan Shakti, according to the complaint. ""She was fleeing in an attempt to get away and went down and fractured her T6 vertebrae,"" Dougherty explained, adding that there were about 115 people inside the store and 25 in the parking lot when gunfire erupted that day. The suspect was arrested at the scene after he was shot in the leg by police. That officer fired seven times at Alissa and hit him once, the prosecutor said. Alissa's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment on Thursday. The accumulation of charges opens the door for more evidence, allowing prosectors to paint a fuller picture of what happened at King Soopers, according to Aya Gruber, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School. “I think they are bringing in as many victims as possible to give them victim status under the law. Additionally, the more charges, the more evidence that becomes admissible,"" Gruber said. ""At some point, charge stacking becomes prejudicial, but it is usually acceptable if the charges mostly relate to different victims.” David K.

9,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/649800364/0/indystar/allnews~Were-carrying-so-much-How-Indianapolis-parents-are-talking-to-kids-about-race-and-pain/,"Indianapolis resident LaShay Brooks is sometimes afraid of what her 5-year-old daughter might learn whenever the TV is on. In the last week alone, that TV has blared so many stories that no child should have to know. When the child in question is Black, the trauma can be compounded even further. The officer who ended George Floyd's life with a knee to the neck went from public servant to convicted murderer. But just moments before that verdict, seen by many as a victory, came the news that 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant had been killed by police in Columbus, Ohio.  Days  before came the worst mass shooting in Indianapolis in at least 15 years. And always, there is the unending drumbeat of homicides in Indianapolis, the victims so frequently young Black men. Brooks, a Black Indianapolis mother living on the east side, worries about the impact all of that will have on her little girl. She fears that consistent images of people who look, act and talk like her losing their lives or fighting for parity will pull her down before she can rise. “I monitor what she does. I stay on top of that. But I also remember being a kid &mldr and learning a lot of adult things on my own,"" she said. ""She is so young, but I’ve already had to talk to her about race and about why saying ‘Black Lives Matter’ makes some people so mad. “It hurts &mldr but that’s real.” As events with race at their core continue to dominate national conversation and spark local action, parents are once again confronting how to have difficult conversations with their children. Experts say it’s never too soon, despite how intimidating it might be to get started. Dr. Christine Crawford, Associate Medical Director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, previously told IndyStar that dealing with the emotional stress and trauma that comes with being Black in America is like wearing a sticky suit. From the smallest microaggression to the most overt racism, everything remains and takes its toll. “Something as common as, ‘oh, you speak pretty well for a Black person.’ These kinds of subtle comments over time, they add up. They stick to you. They start to weigh you down and you have this burden,” she said. “Seeing someone on TV that looks like you being shot in the back multiple times by police in front of their children in the car, that also stays with you."" Crawford adds that people begin carrying that burden at an early age. In her work as a child and adolescent psychiatrist, she works with children as young as 3 or 4. She says children of color can experience vicarious racism that affects their worldview when people in their lives or people who resemble them are victimized. “When a racist incident happens to someone that the child knows whether that's a parent or someone else in the family, it's almost for that child as though they themselves have experienced that race-related trauma,” she said. “They imagine themselves in the place of that person that was victimized.” Crawford said these emotions can lead to young children being overly worried, irritable, on-edge or clingy the more they hear stories about racism affecting people that they know, or people who resemble them. ""It's shaping how they view the world and it can erode our sense of worth,"" Crawford said. Marshawn Wolley, director of policy for the African American Coalition of Indianapolis and father to an 8-year-old boy, said he checks in with his son often to gauge his level of anxiety relative to how safe he feels. He simply asks his son to give him a number from one to 10. “If it's a high number, I'll stop immediately to figure out what’s going on and why he is feeling that way. But if he says one or two, I know he feels safe,” he said. “So part of my job is showing him I'm providing safety for him while helping him work through whatever it is that's bothering him.” Wolley said it is surprising how much his son knows at such a young age. When approaching these conversations, he starts by letting his son explain the news, and from there, Wolley breaks it down to provide better understanding and reestablish that feeling of safety. ""With Chauvin, for example, I let him tell me what he knew and the way he processed it. In his mind, he put George Floyd and the eight people (killed at FedEx) together. So what I had to do was separate those things and then remind him that there's good people and bad people,"" Wolley said. Wolley reminded his son that his uncle is a good police officer who does good things, but there are also bad officers who do bad things. ""I find that I have to talk to him or he won't say anything. He'll just internalize,"" Wolley said. ""So I think it's really important that we're talking to our kids about this all the time because they are dealing with stuff that they really shouldn't have to."" Wolley also tries to explain the historical context behind some of the advice he gives his son. He makes it clear why hearing his hoodie up or having his hands in his pockets will make some people view him as a threat. He adds that children may take on stress and anxiety being carried by parents and other family members, so adults being open about what they're feeling can help children not feel so isolated with their own emotions. ""We have to lean into where our kids are on these issues,"" he said. ""They're trying to process and understand all the concern and all the stress their parents are going through. They've been hearing about death since day one."" Brooks said she wants to have these conversations with her daughter early without stripping her of her innocence. She's also had to talk about it with her preteen nieces who are not only aware of what's happening, but want to get involved. ""And how do you do that when you, as a parent, are mad or sad or hurt by what's going on? I saw what happened in Columbus and my heart broke,"" Brooks said of the killing of young Ma'Khia Bryan. ""I know how I felt and I'm grown. So I can only imagine how a kid who sees it on social media might feel."" Brooks said she has forced herself to get comfortable talking about race because of how unavoidable it has become, and how damaging it can be if brushed to the side. She feels that women of color are among the most demonized and ridiculed online, leading to feelings of lower self-worth. She referenced racist online attacks directed at Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., in reaction to comments made before the Chauvin verdict. But the attacks continue. ""Anytime they can call a woman of color a name, they do it. It's old. They're calling (Waters) a gorilla like they did Michelle (Obama) and Stacey Abrams. They'll keep doing it,"" Brooks said. ""So I have to talk to my daughter about how the world is going to see her as soon as she does something they don't like. ""We're carrying so much, but still gotta find a way to stay up.""

Passing the bill sent a ""solid message of solidarity that the Senate will not be a bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country,"" said Sen. Mazie Hirono. | AP Photo By NICHOLAS WU 04/22/2021 02:20 PM EDT Updated: 04/22/2021 03:02 PM EDT Link Copied The Senate on Thursday passed an anti-hate crimes bill aimed at addressing a surge in attacks on Asian Americans amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The measure, which would create a Justice Department position focusing on the issue and beef up state and local hate crime reporting, soared through the chamber by a 94-1 vote. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) was the only vote against the bill. A series of Republican-led amendments, such as one from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), requiring a report on religious freedom during the pandemic, were all voted down. Passing the bill sent a ""solid message of solidarity that the Senate will not be a bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country,"" said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), the bill's lead Senate sponsor. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), one of two Asian Americans in the Senate along with Hirono, recounted how her elderly mother had been harassed at the grocery store while trying to buy grapes because of her heritage, and told reporters, ""this bill will allow me to go home to my mom and say we did something."" Its passage marks a moment of bipartisanship on an issue that’s sparked broad public concern and warded off a potential Republican filibuster. Senate Republicans had originally expressed concerns about the need for the legislation, but both sides negotiated amendments to the final bill to address Republicans' hesitation. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Hirono struck a compromise on the bill’s language. Collins and other Republicans had raised concerns that the original text too narrowly defined the types of hate crimes addressed. Another measure from Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), which included grants for state and local governments to improve their reporting systems, was incorporated into the bill, along with language from Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), acknowledging the victims of the mass shooting in Atlanta, of which six were Asian American women. Republicans had earlier voiced concerns that the original legislation was intended to score political points against the GOP or was unnecessary given existing hate crimes legislation, and disagreements over the amendment process to the legislation had delayed progress on the bill’s final passage. Senate leaders ultimately reached a deal to allow three Republican-led amendments to the legislation, all of which were voted down on a party-line basis. One amendment from Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and John Kennedy (R-La.) waded into the debate over the use of race in college admissions and would have barred discrimination against Asian Americans in higher education. Hirono, in response, noted racial discrimination was already prohibited by law and called it a “transparent and cynical attack” on diversity policies in higher education. But the final changes to the bill satisfied many Senate Republicans, including Collins, who said the bill’s provisions would improve data collection on hate crimes, many of which she said go unreported. “Without data, it's difficult to investigate and prosecute (hate crimes),” Collins said. Advocates hailed the bill's passage. Advancing Justice-AAJC said the bill would “provide much-needed support for individuals and communities impacted by hate and discrimination.” The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, a coalition of advocacy groups, said the legislation took ""important steps towards making long-overdue improvements to the government's response to hate crimes,"" though the group also urged solutions to violence outside of law enforcement. Asked about the concern, Hirono said the legislation was meant to help the government make ""informed decisions."" ""We're not going to change people's hearts and minds. There are cultural issues or attitudinal issues,"" she said of the rise in bias. Many Democrats and Asian American advocates had laid the blame for the increase in attacks at the feet of former President Donald Trump and other Republicans who they said had inflamed xenophobic attitudes by using terms like “China virus.” The final legislation, however, does not even mention Trump. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the vote “proof” the Senate ""can work to solve important issues"" if given the opportunity and said he looked forward to future bipartisan cooperation on other legislation. The hate crimes bill, a relatively modest piece of legislation, would be Congress’ first substantive piece of legislation addressing a rise in bias crime against Asian Americans if it is signed into law. According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, about a third of Asian American adults fear attacks on them, a higher proportion than other ethnic groups, and 81 percent of Asian American adults said violence against them was increasing, compared to a little over half of all American adults. It now heads back to the House, which is likely to take up the legislation.

The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act cleared the chamber in a 94-1 vote Thursday. It would expedite the Justice Department's review of hate crimes and would designate an official at the department to oversee the effort. It also would task the department with coordinating with local law enforcement groups and community-based organizations to facilitate and raise awareness about hate crime reporting, including establishing an online hate crime reporting system in multiple languages. The legislation, which now heads to the Democratic-led House, is one of the few bills to pass this Senate with support from both Republicans and Democrats.

""Time and again we've seen the misportrayal of Asian Americans and other BIPOC on screen, and time and again we accepted it for what it was,"" said Lee. ""But Vicha Ratanapakdee's death [by fatal assault in San Francisco on Jan. 28, 2021]  made me see that it was time to reclaim our voice and tell our own stories.

Prosecution files 43 additional charges against King Soopers shooting suspect The nine civilian victims gunned down at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store last month were all killed before police officer Eric Talley and other officers ""bravely charged in"" the store, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Thursday. Less than 30 seconds after Talley -- the final victim -- was shot and killed, a ""second wave of officers"" headed into the store, Dougherty said at a news conference. Prosecutors have added 43 additional charges against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, who was taken into custody after the March 22 shooting that killed 10 at the King Soopers grocery store, Dougherty said. Alissa, 21, was initially charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder as well as one count of attempted murder for allegedly shooting at a police officer who was not hurt. The amended criminal complaint list numerous counts of attempted murder for the citizens and police officers who were in the store and responded to the shooting. At least 115 people were in the store and at least 25 others were in the parking lot when the shooting began, Dougherty said. New charges also include assault and for the illegal large capacity magazines Alissa was allegedly carrying. The weapon allegedly used in the massacre was a semi-automatic Ruger AR-556 pistol that was bought legally in Colorado, police said. A motive has not been determined, Dougherty said Thursday. He said authorities are still working to uncover one, but added, ""you don't need motive to prove that someone acted with intent."" Alissa has not entered a plea. He is next due in court on May 25 for a status conference, Dougherty said.

4.22.2021 2:25 PM Mass public shootings are horrifying, seemingly random events with high casualty counts, and for that reason they attract much more press and political attention than far more common kinds of lethal violence, even though they account for a tiny percentage of homicides and gun deaths. A new analysis by RAND Corporation economist Rosanna Smart and senior behavioral scientist Terry Schell calls attention to some of the ways in which the disproportionate emphasis on crimes like the recent massacres in Atlanta, Boulder, and Indianapolis distorts and confuses the debate about gun control. Research on mass shootings in the United States begins with the problem of defining them. Seven databases that Smart and Schell discuss use seven different definitions based on five different casualty thresholds, all of which consider the number of people killed and some of which also consider nonfatal injuries or the killer's motivation. Smart and Schell note that ""using definitions that differ in their thresholds for the number and type of victims or the circumstances around the incident results in vastly different estimates of how often mass shooting events occur, how the rate has changed over time, and incident characteristics."" Based on the narrowest definition considered by Smart and Schell—which requires four fatalities aside from the perpetrator and excludes armed robbery, gang violence, and domestic violence—there were six mass shootings in 2019. Based on the broadest definition—four people injured or killed, including the perpetrator—there were 503. The wide range of definitions means that people are often talking about different things when they talk about mass shootings. After last week's attack in Indianapolis, for example, CNN created a graphic that indicated the U.S. had seen 22 ""mass shootings in the past month."" California Gov. Gavin Newsom tweeted that graphic with the comment, ""What 'getting back to normal' in America means after a pandemic."" A different CNN tally upped the number of ""mass shootings"" since mid-March to ""at least 45,"" based on a definition that covers incidents in which ""four or more people are shot, wounded, or killed."" CNN's count includes many crimes that do not fit the stricter definitions and do not jibe with what most people probably imagine when they hear the phrase mass shooting. For example, CNN counted a robbery-related shooting at a motel in Gresham, Oregon, that injured four people but killed no one; a drive-by shooting in Stockton, California, that caused five nonfatal injuries; an argument-related shooting at a Dallas nightclub that killed one person and injured seven others; and a shooting outside a sports bar in Philadelphia that injured seven people after ""an altercation inside the venue."" CNN's definition is defensible for some purposes. But by presenting this tally in the context of the April 15 attack at a Federal Express sorting facility in Indianapolis, which killed nine people, CNN left the misleading impression that 44 similar crimes had occurred in the previous month. In reality, three of those shootings resembled the Indianapolis attack, meaning that they killed four or more people at random in a public place. Definitions are also crucial when considering trends in mass shootings. ""The data from multiple studies suggest a slight increase in the incidence rate of mass public shootings over the past four decades,"" Smart and Schell write. ""From 2016 to 2018, the annual rate of mass public shooting incidents was about one incident per 50 million people in the United States [based on data collected by criminologist Grant Duwe]. Considering the number of fatalities in these shootings, this corresponds to approximately 0.4 percent of all homicides, or approximately 0.2 percent of all firearm deaths, over that period."" Meanwhile, ""using an expanded definition of mass shootings that includes domestic- or felony-related killings, there is little evidence to suggest that mass shooting incidents or fatalities have increased."" If news outlets like CNN use a consistent definition, in other words, they cannot reasonably assert that mass shootings are on the rise while simultaneously claiming that ""at least 45"" happened between mid-March and mid-April. Another complication in trying to figure out whether mass shootings have become more common is that information about recent crimes is more accessible than information about older crimes, a bias that may create the illusion of an upward trend. ""Because it should be relatively easier to identify more-recent shootings with few fatalities, a low casualty threshold will tend to systematically bias estimates of the number of shootings upward over time,"" Smart and Schell note. ""Even when using a higher-fatality threshold, mass shooting data sources that rely solely on news reports to identify cases also appear to systematically undercount incidents from earlier periods."" Policies that aim to prevent mass public shootings, such as expanded background checks and ""red flag"" laws, often focus on stopping would-be perpetrators from obtaining firearms. But those policies are based on the mistaken premise that people inclined to commit mass murder can be distinguished from millions of other people with similar traits. ""Even if we did have definitive and complete data sources on the characteristics of all mass shooting incidents, it is still likely to be exceedingly difficult to identify useful predictors of mass shootings,"" Smart and Schell write. ""With the exception of male sex, risk factors that appear to be overrepresented among mass shooters relative to the general population are often still uncommon among offenders on an absolute level. Thus, even if one could find a way to prevent individuals with a documented serious mental illness from committing a mass shooting…most mass shootings would still occur because only a fraction of mass shootings are committed by individuals with a documented history of serious mental illness."" Another approach is restricting or banning firearms or accessories that are frequently used in mass shootings. But as Smart and Schell note, ""handguns are the firearm most commonly involved in active shootings and mass shootings."" They are also the most common type of firearm used by ordinary criminals and the most common type used by law-abiding Americans for self-defense. For the latter reason, the Supreme Court has repeatedly said, handgun bans are unconstitutional. Smart and Schell cite studies indicating that so-called assault weapons are used in 10 percent to 36 percent of mass shootings. Even if that percentage could be reduced, it is quite unlikely that the result would be fewer deaths, given the arbitrary nature of ""assault weapon"" bans, which leave would-be mass shooters with plenty of equally lethal alternatives. Smart and Schell note that ""the use of large-capacity magazines (LCMs)""—defined as magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, which are standard for many of the most popular guns sold in the U.S.—""is more common in mass public shootings and high-fatality mass shooting incidents than it is in firearm crimes overall."" They say ""descriptive evidence that mass shootings involving firearms equipped with LCMs result in significantly higher injury and fatality rates may suggest potential benefits of restricting access to LCMs,"" although ""it may be that the choice to use LCMs reflects more-lethal intentions of the shooter."" The rarity of mass public shootings makes it difficult to assess the impact of these or other policies. ""Even if a state passed a policy that had large effects on mass public shootings (e.g., it cut the probability of such incidents in half), it is still unlikely that a study of that policy using appropriate statistical methods would find it to have a statistically significant effect,"" Smart and Schell write. ""This occurs because most states already have zero mass public shootings in any given year, and, when the rate in the pre-period was already at, or very close to, zero, it is not possible to detect a decline in the risk of such shootings that is due to the policy—no matter how large that effect may be. This pervasive lack of statistical power can result in a published literature characterized by exaggerated effect sizes for any effects that are found to be statistically significant, and these significant estimates, in many cases, may misidentify the direction of the true effect."" Where does that leave us? Smart and Schell suggest that the focus on preventing this particular kind of homicide is misplaced. ""Precisely because mass shootings are so rare and it is so difficult to predict exactly who will perpetrate them, the overall costs and benefits of any policy to address them are likely to be driven by the policy's effects on a broader set of far more-common outcomes, such as overall homicide, suicide, domestic violence, and population health,"" they write. ""Improved treatment for mental health problems or suicidality might reduce certain types of mass shootings, but such policies may also reduce far more-common forms of homicide, suicide, and crime and may also improve economic productivity and social well-being. Similarly, policies aimed at reducing domestic violence or preventing crime are worth pursuing for those benefits, and they may also reduce the incidence of some types of mass shootings (i.e., familicides [and] felony-related killings). Focusing efforts on implementing public policies that reduce violence more broadly, rather than making policy decisions based only on the most-extreme forms of such violence, may not eliminate mass shootings but may reduce their occurrence and lethality and ultimately save more lives.""

What matters is having an excuse to evade the second amendment. Having recently done some driving in Mass., I can understand why people would be inclined to go shooting there. You have to embrace it. When someone cuts you off, give them a “thumbs up” and hope to get them back before you have to exit. Cutting someone off in Mass is just their way of saying, “Howdy”! People who cut off an 80,000 lbs truck deserve the lesson in physics they’re asking for.

It shocked me to my core. There I was watching the news and suddenly there’s my friends’ house in the midst of chaos. It was in the news. But no one remembers it, no one acknowledges it. It was lost in the memory hole were inconvenient incidents that don’t fit the narrative go to die. Why? Because the shooting was in Germany. While it’s true that there are more mass shootings in America, it is NOT true that mass shootings only occur in America. They also happen in countries with the strictest gun control laws. You remember incorrectly. – Tony Speaking of whom, I’m surprised the little cock sucker hasn’t shown up yet. “handguns are the firearm most commonly involved in active shootings and mass shootings.” Go figure! Not many people can hide an “assault rifle” on their person. Even a compact sub can cause an unsightly bulge unless you are wearing a trench coat. A burkha with velcro releases does work very well though. You can wear body armor and could hide a little person with an MP5 under that get-up. My favorite movie [actually series] quote of all time: “If your sitting down there had better be a dwarf under there!” Al Swearingen quo usque one of the best lines ever. it should be quoted more frequently. some one should make a best quotes of Al Swearingen. SleepyJoe should outlaw mass shootings. Problem solved. There’s one thing we agree on, mass shootings are only committed by straight white men. No, only the ones we want to talk about. John Lee Malvo’s response to that comment, “Bullseye!” Mass shooting are defined as 4 or more victims.  Blacks are overwhelmingly in the lead. Orlando Pulse Nightclub disagrees. The narrowest definition: “four fatalities aside from the perpetrator and excludes armed robbery, gang violence, and domestic violence” is not much different in practice from: “four fatalities aside from the perpetrator and excludes shootings by known violent criminals and other POC” And any wider definition counts mostly events that won’t be reported in the media like a mass shooting. A straight white man without a serious criminal record murdering 4 strangers without serious criminal records is far more widely reported because it’s shockingly different from the usual crimes. Most people know who you are talking about if you mention Harris and Klebold, but not so many remember Kip Kinkel, who attacked his own high school the year before.  And that is because a person that almost nobody remembers, a 17 year-old named Jake Ryker, tackled Kinkel and jammed his hand into the hammer of Kinkel’s pistol despite having been shot in the chest moments earlier.  Ryker is still alive today. Chris Mintz led his class out of Umpqua Community College when shooting started and went back into the school to help, getting shot 5 times for his courage.  The shooter did not get the opportunity to kill another victim after Mintz stood up to him.  Mintz is still alive today. At the Clackamas Mall in Oregon, Nick Meli, who was legally carrying concealed, drew down on the shooter, who subsequently ran off and killed himself without firing another shot at bystanders.  Meli is still alive today. The media has failed us again and again. They give the shooters the notoriety they so desperately crave and completely fail to honor the heroes.  The names of people who stopped shootings should be mentioned in every article that covers one.  People must be encouraged to stand up to the bastards. Meanwhile, the names of shooters should be smeared with shit and tossed on the trash heap.  Every article should contain at least one blatant lie about their tiny penises, their obsessions with feces and the fact that they breast fed until the age of 6.  Whatever it is they hate the most, smear them with that.  Dylan Roof had an extensive collection of Ebony Studs gay porn mags.  Mohammed Atta had a freezer full of bacon. They don’t mind being called ‘hate-filled’ because they want people to know.  They don’t mind being labeled racists, because they know that it will foster more division.  The ones that live don’t object to being labeled crazy, because it works in their defense. The media fails us by fueling fear.  They fail us by explaining the motivations of killers.  They fail us the most when they don’t encourage resistance.  Resistance saves lives.  Flight 93 FTW! “The media fails us by fueling fear.” They believe their job is to fuel fear.  It is certainly their stock in trade. It is their job to fuel fear.  Fear attracts attention and sells advertising.  Even at a site called “Reason”. And numerous studies have shown a direct correlation between a person’s political views and not only their baseline level of fear, but how they react to those fears.  It wouldn’t surprise anyone that the more staunchly conservative a person is, the more likely they are to be motivated by fear. A third of the country believed Donald Trump’s scare tactics around immigrants in general, and MS13 in particular was justification for building a monolithic, end to end wall all along the southern border.  Never mind that while experts agreed there were places where a physical barrier would be most effective, they also noted that in many places it would be nothing but performative: an expensive, if absurd act to look like they were doing something in order to make the terrified halfwits feel better. The fear raging in the less educated, more provincial-minded rural folks was all it took to convince them against reason to support the political theater.  That is one tiny example of how unwarranted fear, stoked and amplified by the fake news media motivates those who can not, or simply refuse, to think critically. Add this piece to that pile of nonsense.  Parsing the terminology used to classify whether a multiple shooting constitutes a “mass shooting” is a great way to find flaws with the only reasonable response of mandating the “well regulated” section of the 2nd amendment.  It answers the question of “Why is America alone in the developed world when it comes to the problem of rampant gun violence?” with a simple, “We don’t even know how many mass shootings there are, so until we can agree on a definition we should not consider it a problem”.  And the scared conservatives will clutch their guns, ignore the “well-regulated” justification for the right to bear arms, and keep an eye out for another nugget of wisdom from Q.  Oh, and they’ll offer thoughts and prayers too when the victims look like them. It would surprise me that conservatives are more fearful than liberals. The most compliant, obedient sheople in this age of covidmania have been Leftists…scared 24/7… Uttering such nonsense after a the past year+ of unceasing COVID paranoia takes quite a bit of chutzpah. There’s also been numerous studies that show liberals have a much lower risk tolerance threshold in all manner of things (i.e. they scare more easily). Conservatives might have a higher tendency towards revulsion, but it’s liberals that are more apt to govern out of fear. Revulsion and fear are conflated so liberals can pretend I’m afraid of gays and trannies. Actually, that would surprise me a great deal.  The studies I’ve seen show some stark differences in the root sources of morals and ethics between conservatives and liberals but fear has never been identified as a significant difference.  Citation, please. The rest of your comment seems like it’s based entirely on parodies of conservative opinions rather than their actual views.  You also seem to be willfully ignoring all the examples of fear constantly raging through liberal circles. One last tidbit for you to digest.  The average level of education among farmers is rather a bit higher than the average level of education among urban populations. Well regulated means “to keep regular”. As in know how to shoot, clean, and store your arms. Not sure why you retards can’t understand that. Or “shall not be infringed” for that matter. numerous studies have shown a direct correlation Thank you so much, Freethinksman, for your completely unsupported appeal to authority.  You must have felt some of my passion for the topic and figured you better get right in there and smear some shit on it before it got some steam. Feel free to go fuck yourself.  At your convenience of course, because we are using big words to impress the unintelligent.  Monolithic performative provincial-minded parsing terminology gobbledegook freethinkcumstain. You probably won’t give this comment a fair consideration because all indications are that you have constructed a self reinforcing world view, but your understanding of gun violence and the second amendment are demonstrably false. 2009 to 2015 the EU suffered 303 deaths from mass public shootings. The US had 199. Accounting for population this is roughly the same fatality rate (0.62 US vs 0.60 EU). Injuries had a substantial gap, with EU countries having 680 injuries versus 197 for the US (rates of 0.61 for the US and 1.34 for the EU). You’re just as likely to be killed in the EU from a mass shooting, and more likely to be injured. If you instead measure ‘mass attacks,’ the EU actually FAR surpasses the US in deaths and injuries. Bombings, vehicle attacks, edged weapon attacks, and fire attacks are all higher in the EU (well, maybe not fires after 2020 lol). The US is ranked 11th in the world for mass shooting fatalities per capita (behind countries like Belgium and France), and 12th for mass shooting frequency per capita (Austria, for example, has a higher population adjusted frequency rate). As for 2A, “A  well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State(,)” is a prefatory clause. Among anyone with formal English literature studies this is obvious. “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” is the operative clause. Given the construction of the amendment and the surrounding documentation, by both letter and intent the amendment does not require service in a militia in order to own small arms. It guarantees the citizenry the right to own all armaments big and small. You may not like that, but that is the meaning and intent of the writers (Madison and Mason, with input and in an effort to appease the anti-federalists). Serious case of TDS you got there, asshole. Perhaps you can stuff it up your butt to provide the company your head is asking for. Perhaps it’s part of the truth of why the media can’t find the elusive “good guy” with or without a gun who stops mass shootings. The mass shooting that’s stopped before it progresses to the definition of mass shooting certainly isn’t worthy of reporting by the media. The media can’t find their ass with both hands and Google Maps instructing them, “Make a u-turn as soon as possible.” All three of those heroic acts took place within 100 miles of where I lived in a state with only 2 million people.  There are a lot more out there that I never heard about.  2 of the 3 guys I listed stopped shooters without a gun of their own. Maybe because a bad guy with a gun is the only thing that can stop a good guy with a gun? It’s funny how often the “good guy with a gun” thing is trotted out by gun nuts as though honorable intent is somehow proportional to shooting accuracy. Of course, 89% of mass shootings occur in gun free zones where there are technical not supposed to be guns (and thus unlikely to be any ‘good guys’ with guns). Regardless, 15% of mass shootings are stopped by legally carrying civilians. Do you actually know anything or have anything factual to present to us here? Freethinksman, I think you are posting comments on what you believe to be a MSNBC site or VOX articles. You are in the WRONG echo chamber. I am guessing you are the guy that says “only law enforcement need guns” but 2-seconds later say “defund the police!” 15% of active shooter attacks during 2014-2019 were stopped or mitigated by citizens legally carrying guns. When you dig into the topic the coverage is far worse than you even think now. The media misses something like 90% of these incidents, and even the FBI only acknowledge the role of the ‘good guy’ in about half of the reports for those incidents. I came to understand how the media cover active shooters stopped or mitigated by citizens legally carrying guns 19 years ago with the Appalachian School of Law shooting. A Nigerian immigrant shot 6 students, killing 3. The AP report was worded to imply that other students stopped him by wrestling for his gun or something. Actually, two cops attending law-enforcement classes ran to their cars and got their guns; the shooter surrendered as soon as one of them appeared. If they’d been allowed to wear their issue weapons in class, they may well have stopped it much sooner… It’s not that journalists conceal or minimize self-defense use of guns whenever they can get away with it. It’s that most of them are so brainwashed they can’t even understand self-defense with a gun. > Every article should contain at least one blatant lie about their tiny penises, their obsessions with feces and the fact that they breast fed until the age of 6. But, those aren’t lies. I heard that Roof’s favorite activity was bottoming for hung black dudes. And Atta “ate bacon” in terms of sucking the cocks of hogs. “At the Clackamas Mall in Oregon, Nick Meli, who was legally carrying concealed” Why would Meli take the trouble to conceal his weapon? Wouldn’t the apparent lack of a weapon make him a target for any mass shooting maniac on the rampage? Meli would have been safer still had he proudly worn his weapon for all to see. Imagine the comedy if the shooters at the OK corral had to go digging about in their boots, armpits, crotches etc before they could start shooting. I imagine their sidearms were in holsters. Which is a common choice for those that carry concealed. Some folks do open carry. It is quite rare here. A hand gun in a holster on the hip (like the police for example) is considered to be concealed? That is surprising. What is open carry? Walking about with the gun in your hand like a cell phone or something like that which can be instantly ready to use? If it is not immediately apparent to a reasonable observer, then it is considered concealed. So, in a hip holster while wearing a shirt not tucked in and covering the weapon, is generally considered concealed. You should try that A handgun in a holster does not automatically equate to open carry. There are inside the waistband (IWB) holsters. And as others pointed out, a shirt or jacket can also cover an outside the waistband (OWB) holster. Much of the year I go OWB but it is concealed. A sharp eye may be able to observe printing. Some areas allow concealed but not open carry so printing is a big no-no due to the legality. Both are legal here so if it occurs I’m not violating a law. There are also should carry rigs, ankle carry holsters and pocket carry which may or may not involve a pocket holster. Thanks to you and others for your considered responses. I was also curious which was the more difficult license to get, open or concealed, which you answered. Though it seems to me that license issuers could go either way, as people carrying concealed weapons could gain entry into otherwise places which were off limits, or could conceivable pose a more significant danger to others, who may act differently not being aware of what the carrier is packing. Thanks to you for your obtuse, irrelevant questions, troll. I’m not aware of anyplace that issues open carry licenses. At least here, it is legal so as long as you can otherwise own a firearm you can carry open. Some places are “shall issue” concealed permits. You apply but the burden is on the issuing office to show you should not get a permit (such as felon, mental health issues, etc).  Others are “may issue.”  The burden of proof is on the applicant. Such as a business owner that couriers large sums of cash late at night to a deposit box. And places like here have constitutional carry. Where no permit is issued. They tend to treat adults like adults. And as for going places off limits, gang members and other criminals can do the same. So do mass murderers such as the Dark Knight Rises killer that targeted a movie theatre that prohibited firearms, the military base shooter and the gay night club in Florida shooter.  We have 4 verboten places to carry: hospitals, govt buildings including schools, banks and places that serve alcohol. The left is always going to throw out roadblocks and cognitive dissonance while brainwashing their followers into submitting. You don’t counter Stalinist tactics of the left with only information, you have to reeducate their insane followers.  Just putting out news stories isn’t cutting it. What if any is the right’s one true unroadblocked definition of a mass shooting? Wow – Look at all the heavily Democratic Controlled gun crime area’s.  Is that where all the Nazi (def; National Socialist) “labor camps” are? Oh; Yes, yes it is.  Maybe it’s just time for Democratic areas to succeed from the USA and move to another country that is already a National Socialist country (i.e. Nazist country).  Then they can continue to take all the guns away from the few Non-Nazi citizens and leave the shoot-em up Nazi criminals with guns. If you’re a Democrat you do not belong in the USA (PERIOD!).  The USA is a Constitutional Union of Republican States. The Dems weren’t all that bad before Quaker Bert Hoover and his buddy Quaker Tricky Dick Nixon. Those two were what made communism, whiskey and weed popular by attacking them. It’s this kind of rambling thoughtless nonsense that is responsible for people on the left calling the Trumpublicans idiots.  You spout nonsense opinion like it was fact.  “Succeed”? Really? Jesus Christ. but your rambling above about the 2nd amendment and the like is not nonsense? I think that any shooting of 4+ would speak to the desire for limiting magazine capacity. We should probably point out that approximately none of them involve an AR-15. 4 shooters? But an AR-15 looks scary. V-tech was pistols and a duffel of 10 rounders. Parkland was an AR (a statistical minority), but 15 10 rounders for the sole reason that they packed in his bag better and were more concealable. Capacity matters quite a lot if you are surprised and need to defend yourself in a hurry. It doesn’t matter very much when a psycho plans for months, attacks a soft target, and then proceeds to wreak havoc for ~30min-1hr on average. Minnesota SHOULD have gone GOP in 2016, but for those damned Libertarian Spoiler votes. Installing communist anarchists in the LNC wrecked LP votes but failed to turn Minnesotans into girl-bullying, National Socialists in 2020. Yet MN they did retain its Reefer Madness shoot-first prohibitionism. What better lever for God’s Own Prohibitionists to pull than to amplify that while slipping Judge Amy into the Suprema Corte while lobbying to bring back Dixiecrat Coathanger birth control in the National Televangelist States? One thing not mentioned in the article:  I think the multitude of definitions is useful to the anti-gun movement.  For instance, a large number of mass shootings are actually conducted with revolvers.  These mass shootings are often crime related or involve family members.  By excluding them it is possible to build the mistaken impression that most mass shootings involve large magazines (or any magazines) and semi automatic weapons. “According to database A there were 503 mass shootings in 2019.  Based on a study of weapons used in mass shootings conducted by organization B, it was found that 66% of all mass shooters used weapon type Q.”  Both of those things are true, but organization B’s database only has six shootings in 2019, which means weapon type is just noise. God help us all if Jerry Miculek ever decides to go crazy. He’ll drill 12 people in 3 seconds with a six shooter. He cheats, he uses a speed loader. Ban all high capacity speed loaders! well when he does lets hope it’s on the biden puppets back door porch. I thought we’d agreed that the best policy was to stop publishing pictures of the perpetrators of mass shootings. You see, we can trust Americans to freely buy and possess firearms, but we can’t trust them to look at certain photos without going bananas and shooting massively. It’s the other way around. Many crazy people are encouraged to do crazy stuff because they expect it to get their pictures on TV, so responsible news outlets would stop putting those pictures on TV, or otherwise publicizing crazy murderers. Dean Ing based his short story “Very Proper Charlies” on this idea a long time ago, back in the 1980’s if I remember right, but the idea was out in public before then. I think we can consider it proven that no responsible news outlet has been successful since Ing published that story – but I find few signs that one ever existed. Americans are in almost 100% agreement re a policy response. Argue about guns. “Americans are in almost 100% agreement re a policy response. Argue about guns.” OK, it’s late enough to assume you’re drunk. Try again tomorrow morning to post something which makes sense. It’s only a mass shooting if a white dude with an AR does it. We can’t agree on shit because lies and truth are obfuscated. Learn and value discerning the difference. Then criminalize lying. “Then criminalize lying.” How many years for lying about the Holocaust, Nazi? Good question. If you ever get your wish, you’ll be in the dock in a hurry. Chronic, I have read that the Parkland killer used 10 round magazines. The only place I’ve been able to source that info was from a Miami Herald article published 2/27/18 in which State Senator Lauren Book (D) told the paper, Cruz went in with only 10-round magazines, because larger clips would not fit in his duffel bag. Presumably she was citing law enforcement because in a preceding paragraph the article states, “Several state legislators who visited the school with crime-scene investigators said they learned from police that Cruz’s rifle was not top-of-the-line..” However, when the Florida Public Safety Commission released their 458 page report on this horrific incident on 1/2/19, on page 262 (pdf pg 282 of 458) the report states, “Eight 30- and 40-round capacity magazines were recovered from the scene.” And on the following page is a picture of the rifle along with a 30-round magazine and two separate pictures of a 30-round magazine with a swastika carved into the magazine shown in the picture. I put more credibility in the PSC report (that 30 & 40-rnd mags were used) than I do in a newspaper that states a Senator gave the paper the information that presumably the Senator received from unnamed law enforcement officials (that 10-rnd mags were used). Are there any sources independent from the statements of a State Senator (second-hand info) that discuss the 10-round capacity magazine aspect of the incident? I’d be interested in knowing what those are if you have any leads on that. Thanks Chronic (or anyone else who might know). “Are there any sources independent from the statements of a State Senator (second-hand info) that discuss the 10-round capacity magazine aspect of the incident? I’d be interested in knowing what those are if you have any leads on that.” Care to even hint as to why the mag capacity is at all relevant? Sevo, I don’t need to hint, I’ll explain it plainly. I’m interested in understanding what ground truth was for that particular incident. I think it was 30 & 40-rnd mags like the PSC reported. These are typical accessories for AR-15’s (at least the 30’s have been for decades), but I’d also like to understand if anyone else stated the killer used 10-rnd mags like the State Senator heard second-hand. That’s it. As far as relevancy, whether it was 10 or 30 & 40 doesn’t matter from a policy perspective. There’s too many magazines out there for a “LCM ban” to have any impact on crime prevention, though it would likely impede the ability for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves when crap hits the fan. If you know of any other sources for the 10-rnd mag claim please pass them along. Thanks. Portability and ease of concealment make hand guns by far the most lethal weapons for homicide.  Trauma surgeons say that bullet velocity is the one factor that makes wounds more likely to be fatal. Based upon that, all legal guns should be long heavy barrel, low velocity, and no automatic features. When our FF’s gave us the Constitutional Right to bear arms, the typical weapon of the day was the Charleville Musket.  Two shots per minute and a range of about 50 yards.  With guns like that, we would have fewer homicides; plus hunting would be a real challenging sport, giving the deer, elk and gamebirds more even odds. To want to ban handguns is to want to prevent people from defending themselves. What on earth besides a loaded .357 gives a frail old woman the ability to adequately defend herself from a few 300lb criminals intending to do do her harm? Self defense was not given by our FF. Bearing arms is an inalienable right given by our Creator. These rights were enumerated in the Constitution Bill of Rights to insure the Government could not question them. The government is responsible for protecting those rights but can not infringe on them. From what our founders wrote it is more likely the people should be allowed any defensive weapons a government standing army would have access to. They were more concerned with the people having the power over the government if they needed to overthrow it. “When our FF’s gave us the Constitutional Right to bear arms, the typical weapon of the day was the Charleville Musket. Two shots per minute and a range of about 50 yards. With guns like that, we would have fewer homicides; plus hunting would be a real challenging sport, giving the deer, elk and gamebirds more even odds.” First, you are full of shit: The founders “gave” nothing; they simply recognized that some liberties were subject to attempted limitations from lefty shits like you and made sure they were specifically cited. Lefty shits almost always, in their ignorance, assume the Constitution ‘grants’ liberty rather than recognizes them; lefty shits are stupid that way, among many other ways. And then, fucking lefty shit, at the time, the only way to disseminate information was by a hand-powered printing press. Tell us, oh lefty shit, does that mean that the web should be censored by lefty ignoramuses like you, lefty shit? Sorry, this is not a separate post, but is a reply to the lefty shit dougwesterman. So heartbreaking, I’m Afraid Hoping in God to interfere Translation Offices in Dubai We should all pretend if someone is angry or nuts enough to want to kill a bunch of people they will not find other alternatives if they can’t get a gun. Explosives are harder work but if looking for casualties and gore much more satisfying. Banning the mass shooters favorite gun could lead to unintended consequences. If they can grab a gun and go nuts it is bad. If they have to sit and plan and think it could become a catastrophe. Consider how effective the ban on drugs have been.

          / CBS News The Senate voted 94-1 Thursday to approve anti-Asian hate crimes legislation aimed at expanding the federal government's efforts to address the recent rise in these crimes. The bill would identify a point person at the Justice Department who would quickly review hate crime incidents and provide more guidance to state and local entities to make it easier to report hate crimes. The legislation would also expand public education campaigns designed to increase awareness and outreach to victims. Introduced by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and New York Congresswoman Grace Meng, the legislation comes amid an increase in anti-Asian crimes in the past year. The Senate vote took place over a month after a mass shooting that killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, in the Atlanta area. In a press conference after the bill's passage, Hirono and Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, said the bill sends a strong signal of support to the AAPI community. Duckworth told reporters that her 80-year old mother recently went to a grocery store to try to buy grapes and was hassled by a grocery store clerk. ""This bill will allow me to go home and tell my mom, 'We did something about it,'"" Duckworth said. ""This [bill] tells the AAPI community we see you, and we will stand with you and we will protect you,"" Duckworth added. President Biden called on Congress to pass the bill in March and in a meeting with the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus earlier this month, he said he and Vice President Kamala Harris were ""heartened"" by the overwhelmingly bipartisan vote to advance the legislation. The measure included input from several Republican senators, including language that stripped tying anti-Asian hate crimes to COVID-19. Hirono and Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine announced on Wednesday they had reached an agreement on language that removes sections related to COVID-19 but still makes explicit that it refers to the AAPI community. The legislation incorporated language from the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act, proposed by Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, and Republican Senator Jerry Moran, of Kansas, that would allow the attorney general to issue grants to state and local governments to assist them with reporting hate crimes. Before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said passage of the bill would send a message to the AAPI community and the country that hate will not be tolerated. ""This long overdue bill sends two messages. To our Asian American friends, we will not tolerate bigotry against you,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. ""And to those perpetrating anti-Aisan bigotry, we will pursue you to the fullest extent of the law."" The Senate also voted on three Republican amendments to the bill, but they all failed. The bill will now head to the House for approval. First published on April 22, 2021 / 2:34 PM © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. CBS News reporter covering the Senate.

The district attorney’s office late Wednesday added 43 counts to the 11 charges Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa faced for the March 22 attack at the grocery store on Table Mesa Drive that killed 10 people, including a responding police officer. The new charges included 32 counts of attempted first-degree murder and listed 11 police officers and seven civilians as victims. The amended charging document now lists the victims in the order they were killed and fired upon, Dougherty said, with two distinct entries by police. The first entry into the store by police included Officer Eric Talley, one of the 10 people killed, and two other Boulder police officers. “They charged in,” Doughtery said of the first three officers, “and less than 30 seconds after Officer Talley was tragically shot and killed, a second wave of officers… charged back into the King Soopers.” Alissa also was charged with assault, because one woman fractured her spine as she ran from the shooter, Dougherty said. Additional charges could be filed in the future as the investigation into the attack continues, he added. About 115 people were in the store and another 25 in the parking lot when the attack began around 2:30 p.m. that day. Each of the additional counts “represent victims who have a right to be heard,” Dougherty said at a morning news conference about the new charges. Alissa was also charged Wednesday with 10 counts of carrying illegal large-capacity magazines; Dougherty said investigators found 10 magazines with more than 15-round capacity inside the store and the vehicle Alissa drove to the scene. Investigators have no indication the magazines were purchased illegally, he said, and declined to elaborate. Investigators also have no reason to believe Alissa had been inside the King Soopers prior to the attack, he said, though he cautioned the investigation is ongoing. A motive for the attack is not clear, Dougherty said. Defense attorneys have previously said they needed time to evaluate “the nature and depth of (his) mental illness.” Those killed in the attack were: Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Teri Leiker, 51; Talley, 51; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65. Alissa is scheduled to appear in court on May 25 for a status hearing.

Eight people were killed when, according to police, 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole opened fire at FedEx Ground facility on the city's southwest side April 15. Hole then killed himself. Mears has since come under the microscope for his decision to not pursue red flag law proceedings after police confiscated a shotgun from Hole in March 2020. Indiana's red flag law allows police to confiscate guns from a person deemed dangerous to themselves or others. Exclusive: Mayor Joe Hogsett discusses rise in violence after 3rd mass shooting The person has to petition the courts to retrieve the gun, but a prosecutor can argue that the weapon shouldn't be returned and can further ask a judge to issue an order preventing the person from purchasing additional guns for up to a year. Mears did not pursue such an order. ""The system didn't fail, the prosecutor didn't give the system a chance,"" Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder said during a Thursday afternoon press conference. Through a spokesperson, Mears' declined to respond to Snyder's comments. The Prosecutor said earlier this week that he didn't pursue a red flag order in part because the law only gives 14 days for a prosecutor to prove to a judge that an individual is unfit to own or purchase weapons. But it can take up to 30 days to obtain a person's medical records, including mental health history. Mears said that if his office pursued a red flag designation and failed, the shotgun would have to be returned to Hole, despite family saying they would not pursue the return of the weapon. ""We weren't willing to take that risk,"" Mears said. But Snyder called that a ""peculiar position"" in light of other timelines law enforcement officers regularly must adhere to in the criminal justice system. For example, probable cause must be established within 72 hours of a person's arrest. ""Additionally, nothing within the statute prohibits a continuance and the law does not prohibit the prosecutor from seeking to supplement the record if the court took the matter under advisement,"" Snyder said. FedEx suspect: 19-year-old Indianapolis 'voiced suicidal ideation' in 2020 In addition to expanding the 14-day timeframe, Mears previously said he would like to see the law changed to prohibit individuals from buying weapons the moment a red flag petition is filed. Currently, a person can buy new weapons while they await a judge's decision. But Snyder said perceived limitations in the state's red flag law are irrelevant in Hole's case. ""Because the law was never even tried or applied by the prosecutor,"" Snyder said. Snyder said the ""the ultimate responsibility for this tragic event rests with the criminal suspect."" ""However, the magnitude of this tragedy begs important questions. Why didn't the prosecutor seek the hearing that the statute requires? Why didn't the prosecutor use all the legal tools available? Why didn't the prosecutor try?"" Snyder said the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has made at least 45 red flag referrals to the prosecutor's office so far this year. Mears said Monday his office had filed eight red flag petitions this year. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office could not immediately confirm the number of red flag referrals the office has received.

April 22, 2021 In the aftermath of the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, members of the Sikh community are turning to one another for solace. In the past week, vigils have been held, and prayer services and funeral preparations are underway. For the victims’ families, offers of legal and financial assistance have poured in from Sikhs across the U.S. “Everybody’s just reaching out, and people that we don’t even know are reaching out,” says Gurinder Johal, stepping out of a temple in the nearby neighborhood of Acton after a prayer service for his mother, Amarjeet, who was killed in the shooting. In Indianapolis, the Sikh community is leaning on members of the faith after the shooting at a FedEx facility, where half of the victims were Sikh – finding strength and resilience in one another. In Indianapolis, the Sikh community is leaning on members of the faith after the shooting at a FedEx facility, where half of the victims were Sikh – finding strength and resilience in one another. While Indianapolis-area Sikhs have found their community to be a backbone as they grieve for the four Sikh victims, they also have continued to advocate for all of those killed and their families. “Those [other] four families, they are also in our prayers,” says Maninder Singh Walia. In Greenwood, Narinder Singh looks out the window of the temple at the Sikh flag, billowing on a windy spring day, and points out the lesson it offers as the community tries to move forward from its most recent tragedy: “Never give up.” Flags across Indiana and the country were lowered to half-mast following the mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis last week that left the shooter and eight people dead. But the Sikh flag mounted outside the temple, or gurdwara, in this Indianapolis suburb stayed flying high, almost defiantly. Four of the people who died in the FedEx shooting were Sikhs, members of what is at once a religious minority and also the world’s fifth largest religion. And no act of hate could bring the flag down, says Narinder Singh, a member of Greenwood’s Gurdwara Shri Guru HarGobind Sahib Ji. “It’s not the first time it’s happened,” says Mr. Singh. “In 1984, in India, we got genocide, so we’ve come to know very well how we feel,” he says of the Anti-Sikh Riots in which thousands of Sikhs were killed. But since the founding of the religion in the 1500s, he says, Sikhs have been able to look at the high-flying flags outside their temples with a sense of resilience and pride, even in the face of tragedies.

In Indianapolis, the Sikh community is leaning on members of the faith after the shooting at a FedEx facility, where half of the victims were Sikh – finding strength and resilience in one another. The first Sikhs immigrated to the United States in the 1800s. After 9/11, hate crimes against Sikhs spiked here as they were targeted for wearing turbans. In 2012, a white supremacist opened fire on a temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing seven. Police didn’t initially suspect that the FedEx shooting was a hate crime, but on Tuesday new information surfaced showing that the shooter had browsed white supremacist websites. In the aftermath of the Indianapolis attack – amid America’s tide of mass shootings – members of the Sikh community are turning to one another as they search for solace after the devastation. In the past week, vigils have been held, and prayer services and funeral preparations are underway. For the victims’ families, offers of legal and financial assistance have poured in from Sikhs across the U.S. “Everybody’s just reaching out, and people that we don’t even know are reaching out,” says Gurinder Johal, stepping out of a temple in the nearby neighborhood of Acton after a prayer service for his mother, Amarjeet, who was killed in the shooting. “It’s not going to be easy, but least they’re there trying to give their support to make it as easy as possible, and share the pain,” he adds. “Because the families that lost a loved one, obviously, they’re in pain. But the family that didn’t lose a loved one – they’re also in pain.” Chirjeev Kaur, also a member of the Acton temple, Gurdwara Sikh Satsang of Indianapolis, says that since the shooting, local Sikhs have been gathering in committees to direct support to each victim’s family, as well as the families of those who were injured. They’re also working to get in contact with victims’ extended family members who still live in India. “We over here are a small number, and a very close-knit community,” says Ms. Kaur, who spent her Sunday at a prayer service. “And now, the community itself is kind of in a state of shock right now. But like in the past, we have been resilient. We will come through it all.” “Everyone is leaning on each other,” she says. For Simran Jeet Singh, a senior fellow with the Sikh Coalition, a national advocacy organization based in New York, the community resilience he’s seen in Indianapolis isn’t surprising. “It’s hard to imagine feeling this [shooting] as something other than targeting, because we’ve been in this position over and over and over again in this country,” he says. But at the same time, he adds, “We don’t have people saying, ‘We’re stepping away from this because it’s too dangerous.’ They’re doing the opposite. They’re leaning right back in and saying, ‘We’re going to be here with each other and for each other.’” Indiana is home to about 10,000 Sikhs, the Sikh Coalition estimates, and the total number of Sikhs in the U.S. is pegged at about 500,000. In Indianapolis, the Sikh community is largely made of immigrants who have come to the U.S. for economic opportunities, like the jobs at FedEx. But coming to America also comes with the quintessentially American risk of gun violence. “The main reason why people migrate here is because of the picture that’s painted everywhere else about America. There’s opportunities here,” says Mr. Johal. The tragedy at the FedEx facility, he says, presents a chance not only to examine gun violence, but also reinforce education about ethnic and religious minorities. “When you come to a different country, there’s going to be other factors that come along with it,” he says. “But those factors all can be cleared off [with] just a little bit of education.” While Indianapolis-area Sikhs have found their community to be a backbone after last week’s shooting – especially amid failures in existing red flag gun laws, and the possibility that the attack was specifically motivated against members of their faith – they also have continued to advocate for all the the victims of the tragedy. “Those [other] four families, they are also in our prayers,” says Maninder Singh Walia, an Indianapolis Sikh who, along with Ms. Kaur, has come to serve as a de facto community spokesman.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

Armed demonstrators protest outside of the Michigan State Capitol on Jan. 17 in Lansing. | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Opinion by STEVEN SIMON and JONATHAN STEVENSON 04/22/2021 06:30 PM EDT Link Copied Steven Simon, an international relations professor at Colby College, served on the National Security Council during the Clinton and Obama administrations, including as senior director for counterterrorism. Jonathan Stevenson, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and managing editor of Survival, served on the NSC as director for political-military affairs, Middle East and North Africa, from 2011 to 2013. For all the tragic mass shooting headlines this year, the American gun control debate seems permanently stuck. Last week, nine people were killed by AR-15 fire in Indianapolis; before that, 10 died in Boulder, and eight in Atlanta. Despite the anguish over the past month — and despite a push by President Joe Biden — Congress looks unlikely to take any immediate action. We share Biden’s view that the level of U.S. gun violence is a “national embarrassment.” But as National Security Council veterans who have specialized in counterterrorism—with direct experience involving far-right American terrorism, burgeoning jihadism, and Northern Irish extremism in the 1990s—we also see a new threat rising, one that has the potential to change the urgency of the debate: the growing, and heavily armed, American militia movement, which made a show of force on January 6. Increasingly, as militias acquire and stockpile weapons, they’re turning guns from a public-health concern into a threat to national security. And it’s possible that if proponents of reform—including advocacy groups, congressional leaders and Biden—began addressing it that way, they’d have a chance of energizing the debate against the National Rifle Association and its allies. Indeed, the shock of the insurrection has increased the political burdens of an NRA in internal disarray and offered a new perspective on the need for significant gun control legislation. As America learned on January 6, anti-government militia groups are more than willing to jump walls, break doors and disrupt the underpinnings of our democracy. These groups, with transnational ties, also enjoy easy access to high-power, high-capacity, small-caliber semiautomatic weapons—many of which can be converted to fully automatic. The concern isn’t that these weapons will somehow enable militias to challenge the U.S. military on the battlefield, which they certainly will not. It is that they make mass casualty attacks against political or cultural adversaries both easy to carry out, and easy to frame as inspirational events of the kind that mobilize insurrection. The executive orders Biden issued earlier this month imposing restrictions on gun kits and devices that turn pistols into rifles are marginal safeguards and rather thin gruel overall. But his call for reviving the federal ban on assault weapons is more promising and an acknowledgment that serious action is required. An important additional measure would be more rigorous required background checks. At least one key Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, has expressed openness to working with Biden on a gun bill. Generating bipartisan consensus for an effective crackdown on firearms will always be difficult. While gun control is now unlikely to lose existing supporters, it is also unlikely to win many new ones. But reframing the issue as a national security imperative could galvanize passive backers now focused by the assault on the Capitol on maintaining political stability in the United States. A plausible objective would be to impel the U.S. government to take further substantial regulatory steps and to lay the groundwork for effective legislation should the Democrats consolidate their Senate majority in 2022. The administration, however, will have to tread carefully to avoid provoking the very behavior it means to deter. Extremists will interpret increased firearms regulation as validating their narrative of government-imposed social engineering and personal disempowerment. The showdowns at Ruby Ridge and Waco, which fueled the militia movement, demonstrate the risks. Law enforcement at the federal, state and local levels need to prepare better than they have in the past for non-violent enforcement. But the increased magnitude of those very risks is exactly why we need to recast gun control as a national security challenge. As delicate an issue as gun rights is, without action the prospect of cycles of escalating civil violence is particularly worrisome. Even assuming law enforcement agencies adjust their threat perceptions to accord domestic terrorism due attention—as they should—the wide distribution of automatic weapons and abundant ammunition to individuals hostile to the state is likely to be seen as justification for the further militarization of law enforcement in the post-9/11 era. Heavier police firepower, combined with the martial mindset it tends to engender, stands to increase tensions between law enforcement and political protesters, which started in June 2020 with the death of George Floyd and culminated in the riot at and breach of the Capitol on January 6. While Trump’s nod to white supremacism and incitement of far-right insurrection have already prompted some Black citizens to arm themselves in self-defense, continuing police antagonism on top of that could increase the likelihood that Black militias will emerge. Armed conflict between nonstate groups would be even harder to subdue than one-sided, far-right aggression. Meanwhile, the broad dispersal of mass casualty small arms makes every individual willing to use one a potentially catalytic lone-wolf terrorist on the order of Brenton Tarrant, the Islamaphobic white supremacist who killed 51 people with a semiautomatic shotgun and an AR-15-style rifle at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March 2019. Many far-right American militias, including the anti-authoritarian Boogaloo Bois, explicitly encourage their followers to act on their own initiative, as Tarrant did, in “leaderless resistance” against the state, and several, starting with Timothy McVeigh, have done so. The symbol of militia volunteers carrying assault weapons and the reality of their using them lethally have historically been enormously powerful social forces. In 1981, emboldened by the political impact of the prison hunger strikes, Danny Morrison—a senior official of Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army’s political alter-ego—asked rhetorically, “Who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box? But will anyone here object if, with a ballot paper in this hand and an ArmaLite in the other, we take power in Ireland?” He was referring to Colt’s commercially marketed version of the M-16, and expressing the IRA’s strategy of combining violence and electoral politics to change the political system. The “ArmaLite and ballot box” imagery inspired a new generation of IRA volunteers, and took the group—by way of over 1,000 more dead and Sinn Fein’s political rise — to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Unlike contemporary American militias, of course, Irish republicans had at least partially legitimate, historically based grievances. One skeptical response would be that late twentieth-century Northern Ireland differed from the early twenty-first century United States in that its factions were engaged in what amounted to civil war. But the extreme political polarization in the contemporary U.S. is not terribly far from what existed during and immediately after our own Civil War. That toxic and potentially explosive intramural animosity has remained latent and is now resurfacing in the form of the white supremacism preached by most of the armed militias, convinced that the country is run by a malign and treacherous liberal “deep state” and destined to be ethnically compromised unless they take drastic, violent action. To many Americans, and especially these Americans, firearms are exalted as symbols of liberty and patriotism; it is merely inconvenient that using them to impose political change is starkly inconsistent with American democracy, a subject to be elided rather than confronted and resolved. The high level of gun ownership, the ease of purchasing more weapons, and Second Amendment absolutism only amplify the risks such attitudes pose to the stability of the republic. Any legislative effort targeting guns, even if it survives the likely Supreme Court challenges, is sure to be greeted explosively on the right. Indeed, the election of a Democratic president had already caused gun purchases to surge, a trend that has followed such elections over the past several decades. Right-wing extremists hold guns in vastly disproportionate numbers. Law enforcement appears constrained to tolerate their training in military-style camps, more or less openly, and their incendiary, often seditious rhetoric, turbocharged by the internet, as the lawful exercise of free speech. The possibility of muscular legislation, like “red flag” laws permitting law enforcement officers to seize firearms from those judged to be public-safety risks — has only fueled their anti-government fervor. Large-scale confiscation and deradicalization and are not realistic prospects in the near future. But an assault weapons ban does seem within the Biden administration’s political grasp. If the president wants to follow through on his desire to rebuild American democracy, a push to curb gun violence offers an invaluable opportunity and a potentially persuasive argument. Just as in dealing with mature insurgencies or ongoing civil conflict, wise policy in contemporary America would seek to separate destabilizing extremists from ordinary people with remediable grievances. This is common sense. The administration’s message to garden-variety firearms enthusiasts should be: Don’t let seditious radicals imperil your access to the guns you cherish. Protect your hobby by backing enforcement. Hunting, recreational shooting and personal defense against criminal threats are all fine; anti-government, white supremacist militia activity is not. In a deeply divided society and a political sphere in which threats of violence have become part and parcel of political discourse, combat rifles can do tremendous damage to social cohesion. As is the case with terrorist movements worldwide, attacks can be expressive but also strategic, designed to force adversaries to take actions that deepen divisions, complicate governance and win converts to the terrorists’ cause. Durably reducing the threat to political stability clearly hinges on the resolution of big issues, including income inequality, cultural anxieties and an overheated media environment. But we will buy ourselves room to maneuver and time to deal with these challenges by reducing the firepower of militias and the lone wolves they inspire.

The first time, soon after the coronavirus onset, wasn’t so bad. A man stormed angrily out of a popular Westside liquor store, frustrated and sputtering loudly after a clerk reminded him of the mask requirement. This last Sunday, in a big box hardware store, was much worse. A man removed his mask while leaving the store, but then stopped short of the exit to look at a display of garden topsoil arrayed under the windows near the entrance. When a female salesperson approached and reminded him that he needed to keep the mask on until he had fully exited the building, the guy went apoplectic, shouting profanities at the top of his lungs. The manager rushed up and quietly addressed him, causing the man to yell in response, “Go ahead, call the f&%king police.” After several more rage-filled expletives, the man left. Twenty or so people waiting on line—including several young children—stood shell-shocked. I noticed several of them scanning the parking lot. Needless to say, in a country that has experienced scores of mass shootings in the last several weeks, these home improvement shoppers can be forgiven for wondering if perhaps their mass-shooting number had come up.

Trump shook the world by returning the stars and stripes to energy independence, brokering groundbreaking Mid-East peace initiatives, and revitalizing the U.S. military. He reclaimed from Communist China a $500 billion+ annual trade deficit, and mounted a historic response to the treacherous mass-casualty monster all the world recognizes as the China Virus. Writer’s block can set in, or, more accurately, be succumbed to, when everything seems bad. It stinks to have to keep writing about terrible things, like corporate wokeness, technological censorship, the cooptation of women’s sports, and the politicization of professional sports. About the ongoing, calculated (and at the same time patently stupid) dismantling of everything President Trump did that was good. But conservative media must continue to hammer home the implications, the potentials, and the reality of what is happening.

A document released by Justice Geoffrey Venning showed Brenton Tarrant had withdrawn his application, the New Zealand Herald reported on Friday. The document was not immediately available from the court.  White supremacist Tarrant was last August jailed for life without parole for the murder of 51 people and attempted murder of 40 others at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March 15, 2019, the worst mass shooting in the country’s history. Tarrant, an Australian national, is the only person in New Zealand to have been designated as a terrorist. He had launched the legal challenge last week and was due to represent himself but failed to appear in court for the hearing. He had requested a judicial review, which looks at whether decisions have been made appropriately within the law, of his access to mail and news while in prison and his designation as a terrorist entity, and was not appealing against his sentence. He remains in a maximum security prison in Auckland, where he is in solitary confinement.",2021-04-22 21:54:59,Christchurch terrorist drops legal challenge over New Zealand prison conditions,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

""A shooting left one person dead and as many as four others wounded Thursday night in the Gaslamp Quarter, authorities said. Officers detained one person and reportedly recovered a firearm, and the scene was not thought to be active as of 11 p.m., San Diego police Officer John Buttle said. The gunfire erupted around 10:30 p.m. at Fifth Avenue and J Street, and possibly ""a few other locations"" along Fifth Avenue, according to Buttle, who said officers and investigators were still sorting out what happened,"" The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. One person reportedly died at the scene, while three others were taken to area hospitals. ""According to police, officers responded around 10:30 p.m. to reports that a restaurant employee had been shot at 5th Avenue and J Street in the Gaslamp Quarter, a few blocks from Petco Park,"" ABC News 10 reported. ""Police said two people were taken into custody. No other details were given at this time.""   ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection.""

30,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/nyregion/acid-attack-long-island.html,"Advertisement Supported by Nafiah Ikram, 21, nearly died in the attack outside her Long Island home. The attacker is at large, and the motive remains a mystery. By Mihir Zaveri Around 8 p.m. on a cool, cloudy March evening, Nafiah Ikram returned to her Long Island home after a 10-hour shift at a nearby CVS, where she worked as a pharmacy technician. Ms. Ikram, 21, parked outside, and her mother, who had been in the passenger seat, rushed inside to use the restroom. Ms. Ikram lingered to retrieve some food from the back of the car. Then her attacker struck. Bursting out of the darkness, a man in a hood ran up to Ms. Ikram and threw a large cup filled with battery acid in her face before sprinting off. The acid seared one of Ms. Ikram’s contact lenses to her eye. It ran down her throat as she screamed, singeing her lungs. Her family thinks her injuries would have killed her had her mother, a nurse practitioner, not moved her daughter quickly into the bathroom and doused her with water. More than a month later, after several weeks in the hospital, Ms. Ikram still has painful burns and trouble eating. Doctors have warned that her eyesight may be compromised forever by the March 17 attack. No arrests have been made. And her family lives in fear, wondering who would have attacked Ms. Ikram, a Hofstra University student, in what appeared to be an intentionally savage, calculated act that came out of nowhere. “I am lucky to be alive,” Ms. Ikram said in an interview on Thursday. “I think that the whole ‘making sense of it’ will come when hopefully the person that did this or the people that were behind this get caught. But right now, I am trying to just be O.K.” Sheikh Ikram, Ms. Ikram’s father, said he believed the authorities needed to put more resources into investigating the case. “We cannot relax,” he said. “We cannot even sit outside. We are mentally so disturbed.” Commissioner Patrick J. Ryder of the Nassau County Police Department said in a statement that the attack at the home in Elmont, N.Y., a diverse suburb of about 36,000 people some 15 miles east of Manhattan, was a “vicious and heinous crime.” Part of the encounter was captured on a surveillance video, and the police are offering a $10,000 reward for further information leading to the arrest of the attacker or anyone else involved. But in response to questions about the investigation, the police did not provide further information beyond a weeks-old statement describing the attack and the suspect, who they said was wearing gloves and a black sweatshirt. The brutal and seemingly unprovoked attack on Ms. Ikram, who was born in the Bronx and is of Pakistani descent, came as Asian-Americans have in recent months been the victims of hate-fueled attacks in New York and across the nation. A mass shooting last month in the Atlanta area, which killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, and another mass shooting this month in Indianapolis, where four of the eight victims were Sikh, have only stoked widespread fear of the deadly consequences of xenophobia. This week, the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading civil rights group, called for the attack on Ms. Ikram to be investigated as a hate crime. But Ms. Ikram and her father, who immigrated to the United States from Pakistan 30 years ago, said they did not believe it was racially motivated, in part because it seemed like the attacker waited specifically to target his daughter and not his wife. A police spokeswoman said any decisions about whether the attack would be investigated as a hate crime would be made after an arrest took place. Acid attacks occur worldwide, but are especially common in a few countries, including Pakistan, India, the United Kingdom and Uganda, according to the London-based Acid Survivors Trust International. The victims are disproportionately women, according to the group, and acid, which can disfigure someone for life, has traditionally been seen as a preferred weapon of vindictive men who accuse women of disloyalty or disobedience. “The fact that they went for my face is definitely personal,” Ms. Ikram said. The attack on Ms. Ikram began receiving more attention after the television host and author Padma Lakshmi posted about it on her Instagram page this week, asking people to donate to help pay for Ms. Ikram’s medical bills and provide any information that could help the police find the attacker. Mr. Ikram, 50, works as a driver for Ms. Lakshmi, he said. “This is the nightmare of any parent, for this to happen to your child, to this innocent, young, promising girl, who has her whole life ahead of her,” Ms. Lakshmi said in the Instagram post. “I don’t know who in the world would do this, with acid like this. I don’t even know where you can get acid. I can’t stop thinking about her.” Ms. Ikram said her health had started to improve over the last few weeks. She is able to eat some soft food, but still struggles to keep it down. She said doctors expected her skin to heal, but that her eyesight may not, leaving the family, which has lived in Elmont for 15 years, trying to speak with specialists who can help outline a path to recovery. Ms. Ikram is traumatized, her father said, and is scared to go anywhere by herself. Mr. Ikram said a neighbor saw a red car parked near the home, possibly with three people inside, before the attack. He said his wife noticed the car parked there earlier that evening but did not think anything of it. He said he wondered why the police had not been able to identify anyone associated with the car, or found more information about where the attackers might have fled, based on surveillance videos or traffic cameras. “I’m having a nightmare,” Mr. Ikram said. “I cannot focus on anything myself.” His wife is not going to work because she has to take care of their daughter, he said. For now, Ms. Ikram is not able to continue her studies at Hofstra. She said she hopes to become a doctor and work with children. “I feel like I’m not myself,” she said. “Everything I do, there’s a tiny reminder of this incident. And I’m trying, instead of being sad about it, and wishing it didn’t happen, I’m trying to look at the positives that come out of it, even though right now there are not that many.” She added: “Right now I say it could have been worse.” Advertisement",2021-04-23 05:00:16,Someone Threw Acid in Her Face.

32,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/649861396/0/indystar/allnews~agonizing-hours-Why-FedEx-victims-families-waited-so-long-to-learn-loved-ones-fate/,"For 15 hours after the shooting at FedEx last week that killed eight people and injured five others, families were caught in grim limbo. Some rushed to a nearby Holiday Inn near the Ground facility because they couldn't make contact with loved ones. They were desperate for information and shaken with worry. The silence at times in that hotel room hurt. “The quiet was so loud it was intense,” said Vanessa Waters, who arrived at the hotel about nine hours after the shooting looking for information about her friend. “You could see it in the eyes: a look I’ve never seen before.” Waters' friend was OK. But before she left she said a prayer for the others. ""We were the lucky ones,"" Waters said. Maninder Walia sat with four Sikh families who were also racked with anxiety, he said. ""There was a desperation there — to know what happened, to know anything,” he said. “There was crying and hugging and a search for answers."" As the hours passed and the families of survivors reunited and slowly left, a brutal process of elimination played out. At about 2:30 p.m. Walia said, the families of the eight victims were summoned to a separate private room at the hotel. There, police, coroner's officials and chaplains showed them pictures of their loved ones. Final confirmation, 15 hours later, that their loved ones were dead. For many Sikhs: Why FedEx is 'much more than just a job' Making families wait that long to find out the fate of their loved ones worsened the painful tragedy, some Indianapolis authorities told IndyStar. And when IndyStar inquired about the delay, a lot of finger-pointing ensued from one agency to the next. The coroner said other agencies blocked them from doing their work.  The Marion County Forensic Services Agency punted to police saying the police department is in charge of who can access a crime scene. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department told IndyStar that they now plan to conduct a review of what unfolded. Deputy Coroner Alfarena McGinty told IndyStar that Marion County coroners were denied access to the scene until 1 p.m. Friday — 14 hours after the shooter’s rampage. That delayed the identification and notification process, which typically takes about six hours, McGinty said. “It was inefficient and disheartening to wait so long to get into the scene,” McGinty said. “We can’t be denied when families are waiting. We’ve got to figure out something because this can never happen again.” ""We will look to see if there are shortcomings that can be addressed to reduce those agonizing hours for the families if, God forbid, this happens again,"" Craig McCartt, IMPD chief of investigations, said. Further complicating matters was a ban on cellphones inside the FedEx facility for most workers which made it hard even for those who were safe to contact their loved ones. McCartt said police chaplains, the chief and other officials were in constant contact with the families. FedEx also instructed some of their staff to help police with names of employees who were supposed to work that night. A year of death: FedEx shooting is hard for coroner's workers to bear “We had people standing with the families the whole time, giving them explanations, walking them through the process and literally holding their hands,” McCartt said. ""They realized that the magnitude of this and the shock value of it made it that much more important to do so."" Robert A. Jensen, chairman of Kenyon International Emergency Services and an expert on the handling of mass casualty incidents, said all agencies involved owe an explanation to the survivors and the victims’ families. “The system — by having a shooting at 11 o’clock at night and not telling people until the next day about their loved ones, their condition, or if they were dead versus alive or what was going on,” Jensen said, “has done some damage.” McGinty said her investigators arrived at FedEx about 7:30 a.m. and tried to enter the scene at 9:30 a.m. After being denied by either the crime lab or detectives, she said her staff waited for almost four hours. ""We could do nothing while waiting,"" she said. Once granted access at 1 p.m., McGinty said the victims were identified and notifications were finished in 2 ½ hours. Richard Amberger, laboratory director of the Indianapolis-Marion County Forensic Services Agency, said he couldn't ""opine"" on anything that occurred at the FedEx facility, but the agencies followed the same protocol as for other homicides. First, police secure the scene, then the crime lab gathers evidence and then they bring in the coroner. The decision to allow or deny access to a crime scene falls to IMPD, he said. ""They are the ones that authorized any access, notification and such,"" Amberger said. ""All the crime lab does is evidence preservation and collection."" McCartt said the lead detective is in charge of the scene but mostly defers to the expertise of the crime lab for evidence collection. ""There is a whole of lot teamwork and collaboration that normally goes on though police, crime lab and the coroner are separate agencies with different specialties,"" McCartt said. But McGinty said the FedEx crime scene was different than others and shouldn't have been treated the same way, in which documenting the evidence was crucial to catching a killer. Especially with dozens of families desperate for answers. “Here, the suspect was already dead,” she said. “This would be more like a natural disaster mass casualty, in which you go in right away to identify.” Though the shooter at FedEx was dead, the collection of evidence still had to be thorough because police were uncertain whether anyone else was involved, McCartt said. “We don’t want to take shortcuts,” he said. “The last thing we want is that we didn’t get the evidence we needed when it comes time to go to court. Jensen, of Kenyon International, has written a book on how to respond to mass casualties. His agency provides emergency planning, training, exercising and response, and he’s personally overseen response to events including the Oklahoma City bombing, Hurricane Katrina and the Grenfell Tower fire. He said unless the scene was still considered unsafe, there’s no reason why a crime lab technician and a coroner couldn't do their work simultaneously. There should have been some communication to the victims' families before Friday afternoon, he said. A preliminary identification could have saved many families hours of grief. It’s a risk some agencies don’t want to take, Jensen said, because they’d rather wait than chance being wrong. But an over 15-hour lag between an incident and family notification is “far too long,” he said. The coroner's investigators usually go in after the crime lab is finished. They use pictures, fingerprints, DNA or dental records to help identify victims from their families or independently. Sometimes notifications are delayed because next of kin are difficult to find. This wasn't the case with the FedEx massacre; the loved ones were nearby, gathered at the hotel. “Because this was so public and known, I would’ve expected that in the middle of the night the coroners were out trying to notify families,” Jensen said, “either through getting information from FedEx or through getting information from the decedent, such as a wallet or driver’s license and then collecting the information from the systems available in Indianapolis.” McCartt said murder scenes have an established protocol, with the coroner kept away until the crime lab is finished so no one tracks microscopic materials into or out of the scene. McCartt said authorities would review whether it would be possible to break from that regular practice to speed up identifications in mass killings. “I can’t imagine being in their (families') shoes, they just wanted answers,” McCartt said. “If here is a way to alleviate that extended grief we will do it.” But he said a slaughter of this magnitude was rare and new to police. “This is one of those situations we constantly plan and train for but when it happens,” McCart said, the situation doesn’t always jibe with what’s on paper.

33,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/649861872/0/indystar/allnews~Even-in-a-year-of-so-much-death-FedEx-shooting-is-hard-for-coroners-workers-to-bear/,"The bodies arrive at the back door of the morgue on McCarty Street in an endless treadmill of trauma that rarely pauses and never stops. Gunshot victims, drownings, beatings, stabbings, hangings, car accidents and overdoses. And the pace has only sped up recently: last year 245 total homicide victims were wheeled to the morgue, a city record. For the coroner’s pathologists and investigators, most of those deaths were depressingly routine. But the mass shooting at FedEx was unexpected, Marion County Deputy Coroner Alfarena McGinty said. “It was hard, even for my ‘tough guys’ in the office,” McGinty told IndyStar. “It was just different. The most different case I have ever seen and I go to homicides everyday.” Close-knit: Why FedEx in Indianapolis is 'much more than just a job' for many Hoosier Sikhs McGinty said most murders have a motive, a certain logic, no matter how twisted or trivial — drugs, money, interpersonal disputes — that help investigators make some sense of it. “But this, he seemed to go after people he didn’t know for no reasons, who had no chance to defend themselves, who didn’t see it coming, they were innocent victims,” McGinty said. A 19-year-old former FedEx employee of two months showed up with two high-powered rifles and began shooting last Thursday night, apparently at random, in the parking lot and inside the FedEx Ground facility. He killed eight people, many who had just picked up their paychecks, then killed himself. A motive has not been determined, It was the city's third mass shooting — defined as those in which at least four people were killed in — this year. A decade ago, homicides in the city hovered around 100 a year. But there has been a record-shattering spike in the last several years. All deaths assigned to the coroner were up 28% in the first half of 2020 compared to the first six months of 2019, the latest data available. McGinty said she expected the final 2020 tallies to be much the same, with about a 40% rise in overdoses and a jump in suicides. The onslaught has gotten so overwhelming that last year the office began renting space at another site to store 27 bodies, in addition to the 28 it has room for on McCarty Street. 15 'agonizing' hours: Why FedEx victims' families waited so long to learn loved ones' fate McGinty said it has left the office underfunded and short-staffed. The coroner’s office has four to five deputy coroners and four autopsy technicians on duty each day. It got budget increases from the city of 19% in 2020 and 11% in 2021 to $3.9 million, though it had requested nearly $1 million more. “The staff is exhausted, a wreck,” McGinty said. “I’m worried they are not getting enough sleep.” The rise in homicides has a ripple effect: the deaths take more time to investigate than others and are higher priority because the police need the information quickly to gain leads on suspects. Coroner’s officials have to appear in court to testify and “be mentally alert and sharp,” McGinty said. “My biggest fear is that mistakes will be made because of exhaustion,” she said. “Homicides are complex cases. If someone doesn’t document something at the scene or put all the necessary information into documents it could jeopardize a prosecution.” McGinty said it is increasingly difficult to keep up with the demands required by the violence. And the exhaustion is worsened after a shocking and time-consuming investigation like the mass shooting at FedEx. “I have had emotional debriefings with the staff, and I’ve been in touch with national health counselors with experience in this,” McGinty said. “Some of the deputies did need to cry, they needed to let it go.” Call IndyStar reporter John Tuohy at 317-444-6418.

It hurts. ""That could have been my grandmother, my grandfather, my mother, father, my friends,"" the 24-year-old told IndyStar. ""My own grandparents work at a factory. Our grandparents sacrificed a lot to come to this country and to give us the American dream."" Singh and members of the Sikh Coalition and Sikh United groups during a vigil Thursday at the Greenwood Amphitheater demanded accountability and answers from FedEx, law enforcement and elected officials for the victims' families and the survivors. ""This can't be something that happens and we move on a month later,"" Singh said. ""We'll keep pushing authorities to keep investigating we need details. And most importantly we need to know if FedEx holds merchandise as more valuable than human life."" 'Act of violence' took mere minutes: How the FedEx mass shooting unfolded in Indianapolis About 50 people gathered at the community amphitheater to pray and remember the eight victims. Greenwood Mayor Mark Myers, Greenwood council president Michael Campbell, Greenwood council member Mike Williams, Greenwood Chief of Police James Ison and State Rep. Michelle Davis also attended the vigil. Myers said about 1,000 Sikh Hoosiers live and work in Greenwood. An estimated 5,000 Sikhs live in Central Indiana and 10,000 in the state. Sixty-eight-year-old Jaswinder Singh who was killed in the shooting was a resident, he said. ""Your brother was taken senselessly,"" Myers said. ""And this violence must stop. Sikhs promote kindness, peace, and love through our community and this is what we need more of in our community and our country."" The motive of the shooting is still under investigation. But a 2020 Indianapolis Metropolitan police report showed the 19-year-old suspect viewed white supremacist websites a year ago. FBI Indianapolis Special officials on April 16 said the agency interviewed Hole in April 2020 regarding the incident but detected no “Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology” at the time. The Sikh Coalition has since written letters demanding a full investigation on the motive of the shooting. The letters were sent to the FBI, IMPD Police Chief Randal Taylor, Indiana’s entire congressional delegation, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb, Indiana’s entire state legislature, and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. Related: Indianapolis leaders, White House calls for gun control measures after FedEx Indy shooting The rampage last week is the worst attack on Sikh Americans and immigrants since 2012 when a gunman opened fire at  Wisconsin Sikh temple killing six Sikhs and injuring several others. Sikh Americans have experienced xenophobic violence for years, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, resulted in harassment and hate crimes that continue today. ""Sikhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world and yet nobody knows about us,"" Sundeep Singh said. ""We need internal change. Make Sikhism a religion that is taught in schools, allow us to wear our turbans, our Kirpans inside airports, inside government buildings. ""Otherwise you're showing us as a threat,"" he said.

X OUR PICKS: We tend to focus on the wrong problem regarding guns and violence Mass shootings such as those recently in San Diego, Boulder, Atlanta and Indianapolis are tragedies. They also divert us from forms of violence with guns that do not grab headlines, and which pose far greater risks to more lives. If we want legislation that makes the biggest impact on gun violence and we have limited political capital to act, it would be better to be less preoccupied with mass shootings and turn to the problems of handgun violence in the home. Americans are notoriously bad at risk assessment. We often misjudge threats, resulting in badly designed public policies and regulations that miss the mark when it comes to addressing the most serious or dangerous safety problems. For example, Americans judge airplane travel as more dangerous than driving a car, even though evidence suggests the latter is far riskier. The same misperception of risk happens with guns. Mass shootings, especially with assault weapons, are terrifying and should be prevented. But they are an insignificant percentage of the number of shootings and deaths that occur from guns. According to the Mother Jones Mass Shooting Database, since 1982 there have been 122 mass killings with a total of 979 deaths. In 2018 alone, according to the Center for Disease Control, there were 39,740 deaths due to firearms. Public mass shootings that year constituted only 0.2% (two-tenths of 1 percent) of all firearms deaths that year. Far greater of a problem is that 13,958 individuals killed themselves that year with guns, constituting 61% of all firearms deaths that year. There are nearly 14x more gun suicides per year than there have been deaths by mass shootings in nearly 40 years. An American Journal of Public Health study showed a strong relationship between levels of gun ownership in a state and firearm suicides. Additionally, among the weapons used in murders in the U.S., FBI information reveals that handguns were the choice in 64% of the crimes. Among suicides, handguns were used 69% of the time. Even in mass shootings, handguns were used 78% of the time. An American Journal of Preventive Medicine article pointed out that rates of gun ownership, especially of handguns, are more associated with homicide in the home than with homicide outside the home. According to a Social Science and Medicine article, handguns are far less likely to be used in self-defense and instead are more associated with domestic violence, especially against women. Despite the belief that mental illness is the underlying cause of mass shootings and gun violence, there is little evidence, according to an American Journal of Public Health Study, among others, that those with mental health problems are more likely to commit violence with a gun than those lacking such a diagnosis. Finally, more than 250,000 guns per year, according to The Trace, are stolen from the proverbial law-abiding owner because they have not been property secured, and are used in crimes. The above studies are not isolated outliers. They have been verified by other researchers. They are real facts, not myths. Yet both pro-gun and anti-gun advocates ignore them. Mentally ill individuals involved in mass shootings with assault weapons are few compared to how many handguns are used to commit suicides or in domestic abuse homicides. Gun owners killing themselves or their female partners with handguns, or having their weapons stolen, are a far greater risk to the public.  If this is the case, why are we obsessed with assault weapons and mass killings? Simply put, we are blinded by the sensational. Mass killings get media coverage, and the daily drip, drip, drip of domestic killings and people killing themselves alone one death at a time seem routine and do not make the news. They have become the unfortunate reality of American life. Gun advocates may be correct that targeting or banning assault weapons will do little to address gun violence. Similarly, they are wrong in thinking that the law-abiding owner poses no risk; those persons may kill themselves or use handguns in domestic assault. Gun control advocates are living in a fantasy if they think that the Second Amendment is going to disappear, or that in a country with 400 million guns in private ownership any legislation is going to simply shrink the numbers of firearms in our society overnight. Both sides are missing the game when they simply blame the mentally ill for gun violence. We are so preoccupied in Congress with assault weapons we are ignoring the real problem of handguns. The debate on guns is obsessed with the sensational over what is important. It engages in sloganeering and myths rooted in political positions more meant to mobilize partisan voting and political fundraising than it is to address real problems. There is a need to do something about gun violence, but San Diego, Boulder, Atlanta, Indianapolis and the next mass shooting simply divert us. If the political agenda is crowded and political capital is limited, shift the focus away from the use of assault weapons in mass killings and do something that will make a difference.

36,https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/former-cop-reckons-unending-police-killings-black-americans,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement How long must we continue to lament, ""How long, O Lord?"" (Psalm 13), in the wake of each additional police killing of a Black person or other person of color and each additional mass shooting?  As a theological ethicist possessing prior professional experience in law enforcement, in both corrections and policing, I am currently trying to write two books: one on policing and one on guns. For each, I constantly must revise and update the latest names of persons killed and places where the killings happened. I even had to do so this past week just for this article. I can't keep up.  But names are important, and we must say them, even when we cannot mention all of them: Daunte Wright, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner and Michael Brown. And the names of cities where mass shootings have occurred in schools, places of worship, and malls similarly come readily to mind: Indianapolis, Aurora, Parkland and Newtown.  A database updated by The Washington Post since 2015 reveals approximately 1,000 fatal shootings by police officers in the U.S. each year, and there are significant differences concerning race and ethnicity. Among Black Americans, the rate of fatal police shootings between 2015 and March 2021 stood at 35 per million of the population, while for white Americans, the rate stood at 14 fatal police shootings per million of the population.  It should also be mentioned that, in 2019, the FBI reports 48 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed. The FBI also notes that around 5.1% of cops feloniously killed between 2002 and 2011 were killed by their own guns that were taken from them, a percentage significantly lower than the nearly 20% during the 1980s.  According to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as firearm violence resulting in at least four people being injured or killed by a gun, excluding the perpetrator, within approximately the same location, there have been 152 mass shootings so far in 2021 in the U.S.  Although the number of mass shootings are increasing each year, they are a fraction of annual gun deaths. Indeed, there are almost 40,000 intentional and unintentional gun deaths annually, with roughly 90 daily and 10 of them being children, and around two-thirds of these gun deaths are suicides.  These deaths are an epidemic rather than a pandemic. COVID-19 is the latter because it spans national borders and continental boundaries. Police killings of Black people and other persons of color, and mass and other gun shootings are an epidemic with interrelated causes that are relatively unique to the U.S.: racism, militarism, toxic masculinity, and what Presbyterian pastor James E. Atwood calls ""gundamentalism.""  Advertisement Advertisement When I first wore a badge in a large metropolitan area as a blue-collar, white 19-year-old male working my way through community college in 1984, I held these and other ""isms."" I also truly desired to ""serve and protect"" people. As a Christian, I recognized firsthand the chasm between my experiences on the job and the peace I glimpsed in the sanctuary during the liturgy.  I am glad I felt uncomfortable back then when one of my fellow white officers during roll call proudly displayed to us a thank-you note and flag he had received from the government of South Africa after he had expressed his support of apartheid. Not only did I witness excessive force, brutality and racism by law enforcement officers and by the criminal justice system, I saw the violence and injustices that people committed against each other and even themselves.  Sadly, sometimes I had to use force (thankfully, not lethal force); sometimes I was on the receiving end of fists (on occasion, even urine and feces) hitting me. But I should add that the job also involved officers helping people in need, searching for lost loved ones, rescuing persons in dangerous situations, stopping the bleeding from injuries sustained in a car accident, and persuading someone not to commit suicide.  Policing as we know it today is but a mirror reflection of much of the wider U.S. culture. Few nations have police as armed as ours; few nations have citizens as armed as ours. Criminologists Peter Scharf and Arnold Binder observe that in ""the mythology of police work,"" the gun is viewed as ""the primary symbol of law enforcement,"" the ""tool of the trade"" and the ""culturally defined essence of police work.""  At least, this has become the case with police in the U.S., where the public, especially due to decades of TV police dramas and action films, has come to share this vision of guns and policing.  In a country where the more than 350,000,000 guns are owned by 30% of its 332,542,637 citizens — and 29% of those own five or more guns — the gun appears pivotal not only for police but for a noteworthy portion of the population, especially those who regard it as an emblematic American right enshrined in the Second Amendment.  Although I was trained to use a gun, and although I personally have owned a few firearms, I have never felt at ease in doing so. Indeed, it was the emphasis on the use of force in law enforcement that made my conscience, as a follower of Jesus, uneasy, and its exacerbation by racism came to bother me even more.  In the Catholic moral tradition, there are resources offering prescriptive guidance for the reforms requisite toward the end of reducing police killings; eliminating disproportionate stops, arrests and killings of Black persons; and minimizing gun deaths in this country. Foundational is the life and dignity of the human person as image of God. This is the basis for the prohibition of direct and intentional killings of innocent human persons, which would be murder. Hence the church's stand against direct abortion and euthanasia.  Indeed, in the teachings of St. Pope John Paul II, Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, this respect for human dignity and life has become so pronounced that it now extends to the teaching that even the execution of a guilty human person is ""inadmissible."" Moreover, in ""Open Wide Our Hearts,"" the U.S. Catholic bishops add that the ""injustice and harm racism causes are an attack on human life,"" and they ""unequivocally state that racism is a life issue.""  Protection is the top reason given by Americans for owning guns. Although in recent years, Francis has emphasized nonviolence, Catholic teaching does not prohibit the use of force in ""legitimate defense"" of one's life or the lives of others.  Importantly, this is primarily the right and duty of those who are responsible for others' lives, namely: ""those holding legitimate authority have the right to repel by armed force aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their charge."" Thus, individual citizens may resort to armed force only when those authorized to protect public safety are absent or cannot arrive on time.  The Catechism of the Catholic Church highlights St. Thomas Aquinas's stipulation (taught at one of the police academies I attended): ""The act of self-defense can have a double effect: the preservation of one's own life; and the killing of the aggressor ... the one is intended, the other is not."" But the defender should not use ""more than necessary violence."" Lethal force should be used only when one's life, or another's, is threatened.  Although he did not use a gun to do so, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's killing of Floyd failed to satisfy this expectation. Indeed, disproportionate force calls into question whether the death of the attacker is truly unintended, indeed whether it is instead the result of the defender's ""anger, hatred, and vengeance"" against the attacker. The death of an aggressor is not to be celebrated but regretted. As the U.S. bishops stated in their 1983 pastoral, ""The Challenge of Peace,"" ""the possibility of taking even one human life is a prospect we should consider in fear and trembling.""  Ethicist Charles Camosy's ""pissed test"" thus asks whether the defender would be upset were the attacker only incapacitated rather than to have died; if so, then the defensive action would be morally illegitimate. Perhaps Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, police officer Kimberly Potter's exclaiming, ""Oh shit, I just shot him,"" after realizing she had used her firearm instead of her Taser on Wright would pass this test, so long as she truly meant it and was not merely trying to cover her tracks.  While Catholic moral teaching justifies the protection of self and others as legitimate defense, it also narrows the scope of both police use of force and Americans' right to ""bear arms."" It does so, moreover, when taking into consideration unintentional killings, which are not always morally unblameworthy. The catechism states that ""the moral law prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave reason, as well as refusing assistance to a person in danger,"" including ""if, without proportionate reasons, he has acted in a way that brings about someone's death, even without the intention to do so."" Here we find the moral basis for distinguishing between degrees of murder and manslaughter.  Commentators on the trial of Chauvin rightly referred to ""depraved heart murder"" vis-à-vis his second-degree murder charge. There is more moral culpability in it than the negligence of manslaughter. In depraved heart murder, the agent's foreseen but unintended action has exhibited a ""reckless"" and ""callous disregard for human life"" resulting in death. Keeping his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes certainly reflected such a callous disregard for his life, especially since Chauvin did not provide medical care or allow others to help do so when it was obvious that Floyd had stopped breathing.  Aquinas also addressed when a person might be morally responsible for foreseen, though unintended, effects that are certain to result from that person's action. In his treatise ""On Evil,"" he considered a scenario in which a branch falls and kills someone as a consequence of a woodcutter's chopping a tree in a forest. If the forest is not regularly traveled by persons, no moral blame is attributed to the lumberjack. The victim's death is unintended, even if it is a foreseen as a somewhat remote possibility.  However, if the forest is regularly traveled by people, the woodcutter is morally culpable. According to Aquinas: ""But if evil is always or in most cases associated with the good intrinsically intended, the will is not excused from sin, although the will does not intrinsically intend the evil."" We are morally responsible for unintentional effects if these are foreseen as probable or certain.  I worry that the United States' failure to address and reduce the number of police killings, especially the disproportionate rate of killings of Black people and other persons of color, and the increasing number of gun deaths similarly reveals a cultural callous disregard for life. Even if these many thousands of deaths each year are not intended, we foresee that they will happen. If we do not take measures to minimize them, we as a nation are morally culpable.  Alex Vitale, in his The End of Policing, calls not necessarily for the abolition of policing altogether, but a rethinking of the ""basic role,"" ""orientation,"" ""mindset,"" ""mission"" and ""culture"" of the police. I would add that the ""end"" can mean the purpose, goal or telos of policing. And we should do the same with guns.  Vitale writes that we need a ""larger vision that questions the basic role of police in society and asks whether coercive government action will bring more justice or less."" Same goes for guns: Do so many guns provide more protection or less?  Reforms such as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and the Biden-Harris plan to address the gun epidemic make sense and provide a reasonable start, and Catholics should support them. These reforms would provide better public safety for all, including for the police.  Tobias Winright is associate professor of theological and health care ethics at St. Louis University.

Lawmakers left the Statehouse yesterday after they passed the two-year state budget, but they will have to return later this year to handle redistricting due to a delay in census data. In one of the most surprising occurrences in an already unprecedented session, only three Democrats voted against the budget in either chamber. And in the House the only two to vote against the budget were Republicans. That's pretty big. Usually most members of the minority party vote against the budget bill, drafted almost entirely by the majority party. In fact, it was the most ""yes"" votes on a budget bill this century. If you ask Republicans who was responsible for the budget, it was their party. They say their responsible actions both before and during the pandemic helped the state stay above water financially and led to a quicker recovery. But if you ask Democrats, they'll point to the American Rescue Plan for helping stimulate the economy and providing the state with roughly $3 billion to use primarily for one-time expenses. Forwarded this newsletter from a friend? Sign up for Hoosier Politics here. Almost every session there is unvetted language slipped into an unrelated bill last minute. This year, it was language prohibiting state and local governments from requiring ""vaccination passports,"" or requiring employees to prove they have received the COVID-19 vaccine. The language in House Bill 1405 is not as strong as some social conservatives had wanted. It prohibits governments, not private businesses, from requiring proof of vaccinations. It's indicative of a process that played out repeatedly this session as lawmakers attempted to balance personal liberties and safety. Lawmakers approved a bill this week that would limit local health departments' ability to issue public health orders and enforce them. The bill now heads to Gov. Eric Holcomb's desk. Any health orders more stringent than Gov. Eric Holcomb's during an emergency would have to be approved by the local legislative bodies and, in the case of local cities, by the mayor. In Indianapolis, that means the city still could have stronger pandemic rules than the state, but they must be approved by Mayor Joe Hogsett and the City-County Council in addition to the health department.

Prosecutor Mears criticized for not using Red Flag Law Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears announced earlier this week that his office did use Indiana's red flag law after police confiscated a firearm from 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole months before the FedEx shooter purchased additional weapons. Mears largely attributed to the decision to limitations surrounding the law, first passed by Indiana lawmakers in 2005 and updated in 2019, as well as the circumstances of the original seizure. But the move opened him up to criticism from gun policy experts, politicians and the Indianapolis police union throughout the week. ""The system didn't fail, the prosecutor didn't give the system a chance,"" Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder said during a Thursday afternoon press conference. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett is facing this year's third mass shooting, and he's looking to the state and federal government for help. In a one-on-one interview, Hogsett said it's important to push the federal government to pass more restrictive gun legislation. At the state level, cities are prohibited from regulating firearms. “This is not something that, in certain circumstances, our hands are tied,"" he said. ""I would posit that our hands are tied in every and all circumstances."" But what about the city's multi-million dollar efforts to reduce crime — are they working? Some point to the record-breaking homicides to argue that they aren't. “I'm not altogether sure that it's fair to say that some of these things aren't working,” Hogsett said.  “I mean I think that there is a strategy that the city has of long-term intervention and short-term intervention."" If you're a supporter or critic of IndyGo, this legislative session was a roller coaster. IndyGo can once again move forward with the future Purple and Blue lines after language which would have forced IndyGo to reimburse utility companies for relocation work was removed from House Bill 1191. Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said he pulled the language out because he told one of the bill's sponsors that he would remove the amendment if it threatened the bill. Basically that means a majority of Republicans in at least one of the chambers weren't all on board with the language. We told you a couple of weeks ago that a Mike Pence autobiography is in the works by publisher Simon & Schuster. Since then employees at Simon & Schuster have called for the cancellation of the book deal with the former vice president, in a public statement online. No names were signed. ""By choosing to publish Mike Pence, Simon & Schuster is generating wealth for a central figure of a presidency that unequivocally advocated for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Blackness, xenophobia, misogyny, ableism, islamophobia, antisemitism, and violence,"" Simon & Schuster employees said in the statement.  ""This is not a difference of opinions; this is legitimizing bigotry."" A spokesperson for Pence declined to comment. Despite the public outrage and employee criticisms, the publishing company will move forward with Pence's two-book deal, Simon & Schuster CEO Jonathan Karp announced in a staff memo Tuesday. Think evictions stopped during the pandemic? Think again. While eviction filings in Indianapolis were down throughout 2020, they still occurred. In some cases, tenants evoked the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium and successfully fought off being kicked out of their homes. In other cases, evictions still occurred. Advocates for both tenants and landlords say the moratorium has left loopholes for both parties. Tenants, landlord advocates argue, can live rent-free by using a declaration that's not often verified by courts. Landlords, meanwhile, can try to get around the declaration by evicting needy renters for lease violations other than non-payment of rent, tenant advocates say. It has thrown chaos into the renting situation in Indianapolis, where residents like Wesley Lee have successfully stayed an eviction but face uncertainty over what to do when the moratorium ends June 31. ""I don't have any other place to go,"" he said. -SEND US YOUR FEEDBACK- Hoosier Politics is compiled and written by the IndyStar politics and government team.

After years of propaganda and misleading statistics, child sex trafficking conspiracies have become a gateway to right-wing extremism. By
      
        Otillia Steadman Posted on April 23, 2021, at 11:21 a.m. ET Christine Priola had worked in the Cleveland public school district for nearly 20 years when she resigned suddenly on Jan. 7, the day after she stormed the US Capitol, marching into the Senate chamber with a sign that said, “The children cry out for justice.” “I will be switching paths to expose the global evil of human trafficking and pedophilia, including in our government and children’s services agencies,” she wrote in her resignation letter. “This world is run on the blood of innocent children, please look into it,” she told a local news crew a few days later. Christine Priola shows a photo to a rioter in the Senate Chamber in Washington, DC, Jan. 6, 2021. Others in the crowd on Jan. 6 held similar beliefs, bearing signs and shirts referencing QAnon, the mass delusion that a secret cabal is operating a global child trafficking network that Donald Trump was trying to stop. Among QAnon’s followers were two women who died at the Capitol insurrection: Rosanne Boyland overdosed on amphetamines, and Ashli Babbitt was shot by a Capitol Police officer. Priola now faces federal charges for unlawful and disorderly conduct for her role. (She did not respond to an interview request.) Conspiracy theories about sex trafficking and child abuse have been a core feature of the online fever swamp that bloomed under Trump, acting as a powerful recruitment tool and call to action. During Trump’s years in office, believers cited these conspiracies to argue that Hillary Clinton should be arrested, discussed spreading them to divert attention from stories about children separated from their families at the US-Mexico border, and wielded them as a cudgel against mask-wearing policies, claiming that covering up faces would abet traffickers. And, after Trump called on his supporters to defend his false claims of election fraud, some who showed up to the “Stop the Steal” rally believed him to be on the verge of taking down the cabal. But while attempts to reckon with the insurrection have largely focused on Trump’s incitement and the complicity of social media companies, the conspiracies at the core of the QAnon mass delusion were also fed by an ongoing moral panic over child sex trafficking that has not faced the same scrutiny. And, as sex trafficking conspiracies continue to proliferate in spite of the conspiracy’s many failed prophecies, some fear that the movement’s proponents, who had expected Trump to fight these imagined abuses, may now be recruited by other extremist groups or feel compelled to take matters into their own hands. “The bottom has just fallen out of their worldview, they are extremely open to radical ideas when framed simply and reasonably,” reads one message in a far-right channel on Telegram discussing disillusioned QAnon supporters that was reviewed by BuzzFeed News. With Trump out of office and the online persona who has been posting under the pseudonym “Q” nearly silent since the election, the movement’s future remains uncertain, leaving many of its followers to reckon with their own path forward. “If you follow them to their logical conclusion, I think the risk becomes very apparent,” Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, told BuzzFeed News. “If somebody deep in their heart believes there is child trafficking or satanic sex abuse at the highest levels, in plain sight, and they also lose faith that anybody is trying to do anything about it, the risk there is that that individual may feel compelled to try to solve the problem in their own way.” As these conspiracies have spun out of control, some anti-trafficking groups have spoken out against them, but others have validated and even encouraged them. After years of campaigns seeking to raise awareness and sharing overblown statistics about human trafficking, some now say QAnon was the inevitable outcome of a movement built on narratives of abuse and rescue. “QAnon is always going to find a home because it’s rooted in the same narratives that are professed by mainstream trafficking movements,” Kate D’Adamo, a sex worker rights advocate who has written about the connection between QAnon and the anti-trafficking movement, told BuzzFeed News. “QAnon is not a fluke; it is an outgrowth of decades of misinformation.” A protester holds a sign during a “Save our Children” rally outside Downing Street in London, October 10, 2020. Horror stories about children being abused in evil rituals have been around for nearly 900 years; often falsely accusing Jews, they are updated and adapted as the specific fears of an era shift. In the 1980s, the US was seized by a moral panic over satanic ritual abuse in daycares, and many elements of the QAnon narrative — hidden tunnels, the blood of children, and secretive cabals — echo those earlier tales. The concept of human trafficking, often discussed as modern slavery, conjures its own demons. The international protocol on human trafficking has only been around since 2000, and according to one of the negotiators, the definition of ""trafficking"" was a problem from the outset. Writing for the Guardian in 2009, journalist Nick Davies called the story about sex trafficking from policymakers and victims’ advocates “a model of misinformation,” and compared it to the lies that were spread about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Much of the Guardian story — about limited research, exaggerated statistics, confusion over the definition of “sex trafficking,” politicians seizing on the supposed crisis, and feminists locking arms with evangelical Christians to fight for the abolition of sex work — strikes a familiar chord. And many of those same forces have fed the fervor around sex trafficking in the US that propped up QAnon. Child sex trafficking is a real problem, but discussions about it easily veer into black-and-white formulations that prioritize getting a bad guy and rescuing victims over the hard work of addressing the systemic inequalities that are often at the core. These notions have been dramatized on programs like the NBC reality show To Catch a Predator, and they are often part of the work of anti-trafficking groups, who sometimes engage in vigilante actions to surveil and “rescue” supposed victims. “Who doesn’t want to go after child predators?” To Catch a Predator host Chris Hansen asked in a 2017 interview. The political power of these stories of abuse was evident by at least 2012. In January that year, more than 40,000 Christian college students gathered in Georgia for a conference focused on the issue, which emerged as an appealing political cause for young evangelicals disinterested in continuing the fight against marriage for same-sex couples. The conference got the attention of then-president Barack Obama’s team as they strategized for reelection. A month later, after an adviser met with religious leaders, Obama celebrated young Christians who “worship the God who sets the captives free and work to end modern slavery” in a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. “Human trafficking stuff has been part of the discourse in the evangelical movement for a long time,” said Holt, who was previously a reporter at Right Wing Watch. “It kind of goes back to the same thing: Here is this universally agreed-upon evil, and God compels you to fight against it.” The issue became central to a new wave of conspiracies, though, during the 2016 election, and the panic over sex trafficking mutated into the threat of real-world violence. Online sleuths who scoured the Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks claimed baselessly that orders for cheese pizza were actually a secret code to discuss child sex abuse materials, and that children were being held captive below a pizza restaurant in Washington, DC. One man was so alarmed by the claims that he traveled to the restaurant with a gun to investigate for himself. He fired several shots without injuring anyone, before he was arrested. QAnon picked up where the incident that came to be known as Pizzagate left off. The online poster claiming to be an anonymous government official with a Q-level security clearance first appeared in October 2017. The first message seized on an unusual comment from Trump about “the calm before the storm” as a cloaked reference to his alleged efforts to take down a cabal of Satan-worshipping Democrats and Hollywood celebrities running a child sex trafficking ring. In the years since, the false claims have gained momentum. Financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s abuses against young women, and his connections to prominent figures like the Clintons and the UK’s Prince Andrew, have been cited for years as evidence of a global child trafficking ring. Another online campaign, Operation Death Eaters, which was an offshoot of the Anonymous hacktivist collective, sought to expose child sex abusers like Epstein in 2014. Epstein had been convicted on charges of solicitation of prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution in a 2008 “sweetheart” plea deal that sentenced him to 18 months in jail. His arrest in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and his suicide while in prison were a major source of validation for QAnon believers, who in these events saw proof of both the cabal and the cover-up that Q described. Politicians also seized on the issue and legitimized the conspiracy. After the Trump administration announced Justice Department funding to organizations that provide housing for human trafficking survivors, QAnon followers seized on the grants as evidence of Trump’s fight against the global cabal of child sex abusers, and the news became one of the most-shared stories on Facebook. When asked about QAnon during a presidential town hall in October, Trump refused to disavow it, saying, “I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard, but I know nothing about it.” Sen. Josh Hawley, who raised a fist in solidarity with the rioters on Jan. 6, warned in a 2018 campaign speech of a growing “human trafficking crisis” that he falsely attributed to the “sexual revolution” of the ’60s and ’70s, saying it caused the “exploitation of women on a scale that we would never have imagined.” The scale of the problem, however, has been difficult to pin down. The International Labour Organization estimates that of the roughly 24.9 million people in forced labor worldwide, the vast majority — about 80% — are involved in nonsexual labor. In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services said bluntly in a 2018 report to Congress that “research on minor-victim sex trafficking does not support estimates of the number of victims.” Anyone who is trading sex under the age of 18 is considered a victim of sex trafficking, whether or not they are forced or coerced into it. HHS cited a 2016 study from the Center for Court Innovation, which was based on interviews with about 950 people between the ages of 13 and 24 in the sex trade as one of the most thorough studies. That report estimated that there may be around 10,500 people under the age of 18 in the sex trade in the US. Only about 15% of the people interviewed, though, said they were doing so under the control of another person. HHS suggests that the total number of victims may be higher since the CCI study focused primarily on street-based work, but that is a far cry from many of the claims commonly circulated on social media that hundreds of thousands of children are at risk of sex trafficking. Despite the uncertainty around these numbers and the complex social inequalities that contribute to trafficking, many anti-trafficking advocates continue to promote sensational statistics and awareness campaigns that distort the public’s understanding of the subject. Polaris, an advocacy organization that receives funding from HHS to operate the National Human Trafficking Hotline, has spoken out about the dangers of QAnon and misinformation, and signed an open letter to Congress along with dozens of other groups declaring that supporting “QAnon conspiracies related to human trafficking actively harms the fight against human trafficking.” But it has also been criticized for spreading misleading numbers and promoting harmful policies. The organization says it has identified about 63,000 instances of trafficking with one or more victims since 2007. However, these numbers are based on anonymous calls and include situations where the organization is only moderately certain that trafficking has occurred. “Cases coded as ‘Moderate’ contain several indicators and red flags of potential trafficking situations, or resemble common trafficking scenarios but lack certain core details of force, fraud, or coercion,” a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. In the aftermath of the mass shooting in the Atlanta area last month, where three spas were targeted, Polaris took down a report online that vilified “illicit massage businesses” and was promoted with a campaign encouraging the public to get involved in shutting them down. The organization told Vice that it was concerned that white supremacists could use the report to justify violence. Other organizations have gone so far as to say some QAnon narratives were, essentially, legitimate. In June 2020, when baseless rumors started spreading on social media that the furniture company Wayfair was trafficking children in expensive cabinets, Tim Ballard, who founded Operation Underground Railroad and was appointed by Trump to cochair an advisory council on human trafficking, told the New York Times he saw the conspiracies as an opportunity; he posted a video on Twitter, saying, “Bottom line, law enforcement is going to flesh that out, and we’ll get our answer sooner than later. But I want to tell you this: Children are sold that way.” A woman wears a shirt promoting a conspiracy theory promoted by QAnon while waiting in line to attend a campaign rally with President Trump at Phoenix Goodyear Airport, Oct. 28, 2020. As the conspiracies spread online, adherents began to take action in response to the perceived crisis by blocking traffic across the Hoover Dam to demand answers, vandalizing churches they believed were implicated, harassing members of the public who supposedly victims, and, in a few cases, killing people. The pandemic, during which people have been fearful and spending more time online, reenergized QAnon, which had slowed after the website where Q had posted was taken offline. Research indicates that much of the renewed interest came from conspiracies about child sex trafficking. The hashtag #SaveTheChildren was co-opted by QAnon followers and picked up by lifestyle and parenting bloggers. Messages adapted for Instagram brought women, and moms in particular, into the fringe movement with pastel-colored messages about an alternative reality in which child sex abuse was the real pandemic. In the wake of mass demonstrations following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, QAnon followers organized another set of protests, sometimes with the slogan “Child Lives Matter.” In their effort to expose suspected traffickers, QAnon believers have also interfered with legitimate anti-trafficking efforts. A recent report from Polaris on the mass delusion says its followers have doxed staffers and members of the organization’s board in 2018 and deluged the hotline with calls about baseless conspiracies. Anjana Rajan, Polaris’s CTO, who had been tracking threats against the organization, told BuzzFeed News that the calls had alarmed her last summer because they were an indication of believers’ commitment. “There’s an important link between online and offline action on this,” Rajan said. “Posting on a message board is a pretty low-friction thing to do. Taking an action to call a hotline … that is an offline action that I think is a signal of something more severe to come.” Researchers at START, a consortium of terrorism researchers headquartered at the University of Maryland, have so far identified 71 QAnon followers — 17 women and 54 men — who have allegedly committed crimes on the basis of their beliefs, about half of which took place during the Jan. 6 insurrection. Michael Jensen, a senior researcher at START, said the number of people who had preexisting mental health conditions was “alarmingly high.” The researchers have only examined the mental health backgrounds of defendants in cases unrelated to the insurrection so far, and found that about 66% were radicalized after experiencing some kind of trauma. That number is even higher for women, with 83% having specifically experienced trauma related to the physical or sexual abuse of their children. “Many of them…are primarily motivated by this idea of child sex trafficking, and this belief that they’re fighting this criminal enterprise,” said Jensen. The sister of Rosanne Boyland, one of the rioters who died during the Capitol insurrection, said she had been drawn in by the Wayfair conspiracy. And, tweets from Ashli Babbitt show that sex trafficking and a desire to protect children were concerns for her as well. Babbitt tweeted about sex trafficking as early as January 2019, about a year before her first tweet about QAnon, writing, “I live 15 min from Tijuana....what trump speaks is truth. the drugs the crime the sex trafficking the gangs..the sickness..IT IS ALL HAPPENING.” Some of Babbitt’s tweets have apparently been removed, but reporting from Bellingcat shows that she tweeted about Pizzagate in November 2019 and began to use QAnon-related hashtags in February 2020. She announced that she would be attending the rally in DC on Jan. 6, 2021, by replying, to a since-deleted tweet that said, “We will not let the children be forgotten.” It’s unclear what will become of these conspiracies with Trump out of office. Some QAnon followers have begun to abandon the movement after it became clear that the former president would not fulfill Q’s predictions of mass arrests. And while the investigation into allegations of sex trafficking against Matt Gaetz might seem like fodder for new conspiracies, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and proponent of QAnon, has defended him. Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, who has also expressed support for the conspiracies, were elected to Congress last fall, along with numerous other QAnon believers in local elections who now hold positions around the country. In the aftermath of the insurrection, FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress that the bureau considers white supremacist groups a “persistent, evolving threat.” And as right-wing organizations recalibrate their strategies for gaining support in the Joe Biden era, Q adherents represent a large pool of Trump supporters left without guidance. Jensen cautioned that the overall number of people who had been motivated by their belief in QAnon to commit crimes was low relative to the millions who have been exposed to the conspiracies. But for white supremacists looking to recruit, connecting sex trafficking to the old “blood libel” conspiracies about Jews using children for ritual sacrifice has been a way in. “[Right-wing] groups and white nationalists are largely dealing with what is already out there,” said Brian Friedberg, a researcher at Harvard’s Technology and Social Change Project. “From my perspective, they are trying to harness preexisting narratives rather than inventing anything new.” The attraction for Cleveland public school employee Christine Priola to such conspiracies could be looked at in much the same way. “I have known for many years that I wanted to work with children and assist in their development,” she wrote in her application for the job in the Cleveland public school district. “I understand that development in the critical years of childhood help form the foundation for healthy, safe, and respectful adult lives. I feel that I have a special rapport with children and find creative ways to facilitate the learning process.” ● Otillia Steadman is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

New York City Mayoral candidate Eric Adams once said he would arm himself if elected mayor — a position he modified in an interview with POLITICO. | David Dee Delgado/Getty Images By SALLY GOLDENBERG 04/23/2021 04:30 AM EDT Link Copied NEW YORK — After 11 people were fatally shot inside a Pittsburgh synagogue three years ago, a politician nearly 400 miles away demanded an immediate shift in protocol. “From now on, I will bring my handgun every time I enter a church or synagogue,” Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a retired police captain who is now a leading candidate for New York City mayor, said the following day, encouraging trained cops to do the same. The responses were swift: Emails poured into his office from New Yorkers horrified by the suggestion. They invoked red-state Republicans and the National Rifle Association, and one person expressed gratitude to live on the other side of the East River. The anger was offset by a few people who agreed with the proposition — including one who requested a reference letter to obtain his own permit to carry a concealed weapon, according to previously unreported emails POLITICO obtained through a freedom of information request. Now Adams is among the top-tier Democratic candidates running to be the next mayor of New York, ranking second in most public polls and sitting on a $7.8 million war chest. As he competes in an eight-person field, he is carving a path formed by his biography: A Black man who openly discusses being a teenager assaulted by police officers, only to become one himself at a time when the city was mired in crime. He quickly challenged orthodoxies within the NYPD, protesting the cop shooting of a mentally-ill Black woman when he was in the Police Academy. Despite four years as a registered Republican, he considers himself a progressive before it became popular. But as a proud former police officer running for mayor with crime on the rise, Adams is often castigated for being out of step with the activist wing of a party whose vote he is seeking on June 22. He wants to reinstate a plainclothes unit disbanded by the NYPD last year to focus on gun safety. He readily denounces the “defund NYPD” slogan that surged after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year. He has defended the controversial practice of stop-and-frisk if used correctly. He wants spot checks for guns entering the city at Port Authority bus terminals. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams speaks to reporters. | AP Photo And he once said he would arm himself if elected mayor — a position he modified in an interview with POLITICO. Where some candidates focus on criminal justice reform, Adams has zeroed in on the uptick in shootings — a 64-percent increase this year, according to recent data. “The prerequisite to prosperity is public safety,” he often says. As a four-term state senator, Adams focused on gun safety, demonstrating the ease with which firearms could be brought into the city following a mass shooting at a movie theater in Colorado in 2012. He also pushed for legislation to close loopholes in the state's assault weapons ban. The borough president said in an interview with POLITICO this week that he’s sticking by his stance. “My life as a law enforcement officer for 22 years is rooted in not so much idealism, but realism,” Adams said. “I understand how people may have responded, but when people prey on individuals while they’re praying, that’s an alarm for me.” Adams — who would be the first police officer as mayor since William O’Dwyer in the late 1940s — must now persuade segments of Democratic voters that his history as a cop does not detract from his plans for police reform, which include publicizing a list of officers being monitored for complaints. At the same time, he is banking on support from voters who are reporting violence as a leading concern, according to a new poll. Despite those fears, New York is an overwhelmingly Democratic city where legal firearms are usually restricted to law enforcement officers. Like many former cops, Adams still owns three guns, 15 years after he retired from the force. Adams’ comments after the Pittsburgh shooting prompted a flurry of angry emails from constituents. “Please let me know where you will be so that I am not there,” one resident, Wendy Bellus, wrote to Adams in 2018, after his remarks on the Pittsburgh shooting. “With your call to action, I can imagine — a person with bad intent shooting at innocent people; people with licensed guns whipping them out and shooting back. What can go wrong?” “You have bought into the NRA narrative, which is violence to combat violence,” she added. Another Brooklynite who said she had previously voted for Adams echoed those concerns. “I don’t really care that you are a retired police officer. I firmly believe that more guns in circulation is NOT the right answer,” Moira Flavin wrote. “I know you want to run for mayor in the next election and I think you need to give some real thought to your stance on guns. “This does not make me feel better; it scares me,” she added. Prospect Heights resident Lori Azim said her cousin, a Republican cop in Kansas, was more liberal than Adams on gun laws. Alice Henkin lamented the Democratic borough being turned into “the eastern branch of Texas!” The remarks even cost him governmental support. Venture capitalist Charlie O’Donnell canceled his involvement in a technology event planned with Brooklyn Borough Hall. “I was really looking forward to collaborating on an event with the BP’s office, but I’m afraid I can no longer lend my support. The borough president’s call for guns to be brought to houses of worship is absolutely the wrong response to the problem of violence and hate,” O’Donnell wrote one day after Adams’ Pittsburgh comments. “The ‘good guy with a gun approach’ is a fantasy - as we saw *four* police officers wounded at the Pittsburgh shooting.” Adams’ staff, faced with the fallout, grew concerned. “He has direct connections to many tech companies as well as much respect within the tech community that helps him draw large crowds to anything he organizes,” Borough Hall employee Joshua Levine wrote to Adams about O’Donnell. Lew Fidler, a late City Council member working for Adams at the time, forwarded a news article titled “Adams calls for guns in places of worship” to other staffers and advised that “the narrative should be changed quickly.” The borough president sought to make clear his statement was limited to retired and off-duty police officers who are already legally allowed to carry their weapons. In the interview with POLITICO, he noted that armed officers often accompany high-ranking politicians into houses of worship, and at other times are stationed outside. In one instance, an off-duty armed officer prevented a shooting at a church in Queens, he said. “If you’re saying to me, ‘Eric, I wouldn't want that person to be armed when that person's coming down the aisle,’ then we really have a different perspective,” he said. Some residents agreed with him. A.R. Bernard, a well-known pastor in Brooklyn, co-authored an op-ed with Adams in the Daily News titled, “Guns have a place in houses of worship: We shouldn't be afraid of highly trained off-duty cops carrying firearms.” A peace officer asked him to support a policy change allowing that workforce to carry their weapons. Another resident requested he provide a reference letter to help him obtain a permit, which Adams said he did not do. Retired officer Gary Gorman wrote a note of appreciation: “As a retiree with an unrestricted, I carry to my church but all active officers I feel should carry and licensed retirees should carry also.” That same day someone named Kenneth Bromberg emailed Brooklyn Borough Hall in agreement. “I can’t think of who is better trained to use their weapons and who is better screened and observed for mental illness,” Bromberg wrote. Adams has been running in second place in most polls, behind former presidential candidate Andrew Yang in a race unlike others in recent memory: It is taking place as the city is crawling out of a pandemic-induced shutdown, voters will head to the polls in June instead of September and their ballots will debut ranked-choice voting. While Yang has been leading every poll, most candidates have yet to begin airing TV ads. And if the last competitive primary is any indication, the outcome is far from decided — at this time in 2013, Bill de Blasio was polling in third or fourth place. As the campaign heats up, Adams has been the most vocal of the contenders in honing in on the rise in gun violence across the city. A Spectrum News NY1/Ipsos poll released last week found 39 percent of likely Democratic voters think crime and violence are the main problems facing the city, second only to Covid-19, at 51 percent. Asked which candidate would best protect public safety, Adams and Yang were tied at 17 percent. Recognizing the public concern over rising crime, Adams recently held a press conference on the steps of a Bronx courthouse to lay out his safety plan alongside longtime activist Jackie Rowe Adams, who lost two sons to gun violence. He also made a point of avoiding protests after the guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial on Tuesday. Instead, he told POLITICO he spent time with his 24-year-old son, discussing police attacks on Black New Yorkers over the years. “I wanted that to be a moment not of protesting, but a moment for him to see that he needs to pick up the mantle and pick up this fight,” Adams said. “And throwing a molotov cocktail is not a plan.” This week he accused his opponents of a “deafening silence … on the rising temperature of gun violence, senseless bloodshed that overwhelmingly destroys Black and brown lives.” “Many people are afraid to be honest around this conversation because it’s not a popular kind of conversation to people who are covering this race,” he said in the interview. “A parent does not receive consolation if someone knocks on their door and says a person in a blue uniform killed their child unjustly, or a gangbanger in blue jeans.” Adams previously said he would arm himself and get rid of the police officers that traditionally accompany mayors if elected to lead City Hall. “So, as mayor, would you carry a firearm on you, even with a security detail?” Fordham University political science professor Christina Greer, who hosts the FAQNYC podcast, asked him in January of 2020. “Yes I will, number one, and number two, I won’t have a security detail. If the city is safe the mayor shouldn’t have a security detail with him; he should be walking the street by himself,” Adams responded. On Wednesday, he softened his stance, saying he made those remarks during a “lighthearted” interview and was “surprised” by the sustained attention it received. He would only arm himself, he said, if he was in immediate danger. “If the intelligence informs me that, ‘Eric, there’s a serious, imminent threat to you,’ then I would carry my firearm,” he said. “I would definitely decrease my detail population, my police detail. I believe officers should be protecting the public and I don’t think you need a large police detail as you move around the city.” Adams has said his inspiration for joining the NYPD came from loved ones and mentors who steered him onto that track after he was arrested for trespassing as a 15-year-old in Southeast Queens and beaten by officers in the precinct. “Can you imagine being 15, laying on the floor of the 103 precinct? I was a baby,” he said on Wednesday. “Those cops, kicking me in the groin over and over and over again, and looking at their faces and seeing almost pleasure in them doing it. You are marked and traumatized for the rest of your life. Wounds go away but scars remain.” Years later, as a member of the state Senate, he tapped a staffer to tape him showing viewers how to search their homes for contraband — a video that resurfaced recently and inspired a retort by mayoral candidate Paperboy Love Prince titled, “Eric Adams Please Get Out of My Room.” Greer, in a recent interview, posited that Adams’ focus on crime is a smart political strategy. “Black mayors are oftentimes accused of being soft on crime,” she said. “My question for him then and it still is now — is your strategy still, we all strap up and go to Shabbat dinner, and go to the mosque, and go to church on Sunday?” she added. “Because that’s what he said after the Pittsburgh shooting. And if it’s not then that’s fine; you’ve evolved. But I don’t see how that strategy works for a city of 9 million people.” Link Copied © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2021-04-23 04:30:41,An armed New York mayor?

The new chief will be at the helm of a department that saw a fatal police shooting, a mass shooting, citywide curfews and months of protests throughout the city in 2020. A survey, which was answered by 467 respondents, listed law enforcement, visionary, problem-solving, decision making and community and citizen focus as the top competencies people want to see in the new police chief. Policing in Wauwatosa has been heavily scrutinized recently, following months of unrest in the city after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by former Wauwatosa officer Joseph Mensah. ""They'll have a difficult task,"" said Katherine Riebe, a member of the citizen social justice group Tosa Together, about the new police chief's role. But some in the community view this change in leadership as an opportunity to increase trust between the community and police department. ""I think the community is definitely open to change, and open to listen and open to new things and I hope the new police chief would be in that same direction of being willing to talk and listen to the different groups in Wauwatosa and how we're feeling,"" said Linda Ertel, the coordinator for the nonprofit Tosa Cares. Wauwatosa will get a new police chief for the first time since 1990, after chief Barry Weber retires on June 1. And community members are using this opportunity to chime in with what they think some of the most important qualities for the new chief are. ""I think the top quality would be honesty and integrity,"" Riebe said. ""We need someone who displays that he or she is trustworthy; we can trust what they say, we can trust what they've done."" She also believes the chief should be someone who is a good listener. ""We need someone who is willing to entertain different and creative out-of-the-box ideas,"" she said. The choice for the new chief ultimately lies with the police and fire commission, a five-member citizen-led panel chaired by a former Wauwatosa police detective. It currently is leading a national search for candidates. The finalists will participate in a public forum with the community. Community involvement is a top priority for many in the city. Jason Mack is the pastor of Underwood Memorial Baptist Church in Wauwatosa. ""I would be interested in someone who also has a proven track record of working with the community and being in partnership with local community leaders, people who are speaking out and who have concerns,"" Mack said. ""Someone who has an open communication style with the community at large."" Sean Lowe, the chairperson of the Wauwatosa Equity and Inclusion Commission, also wants to see a focus on community policing. ""I want to see a police chief that is heavily community-focused and understands the importance of what community policing truly is,"" Lowe said. But community policing goes beyond just being present in the community, according to Joseph Kraynick, an organizer with Indivisible Tosa. ""We want (the new chief) to take seriously community voices, to communicate with us and to work with us, rather than taking an us versus them stance,"" Kraynick said. A Gallup poll from 2020 found that confidence in police had fallen five points, to 48%, from one year before. Some say the trust in police has fallen in Wauwatosa as well. ""The trust is beyond broken, in many communities, including a lot of individuals in Wauwatosa, and so it's gonna take not just months but years to repair some relationships,"" Lowe said. Kosta Zervas, the director of the Hart Park Senior Center, said he understands that not everyone in the community always trusts the police. ""I think it's a really important aspect of the new police chief, that they can build that continuity between the community and the police department, to bring that level of trust back, if it's not there right now,"" Zervas said. It's important for the new police chief to be visible and to listen to the community, Zervas said. RELATED: Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber must testify in the Jay Anderson Jr. shooting hearing after claims of interference, judge rules Ertel has lived in Wauwatosa for over 40 years. ""Being a longtime community member, I've always felt safe and secure but not everybody has,"" Ertel said. ""And so, it's really time to make sure we're listening to everyone and I look forward to that kind of a leader in our police chief."" Kraynick mentioned that many people from outside of the city come to Wauwatosa to shop and work throughout the day. ""We want to see the new police chief be someone that is committed to equity, equality, and to being able to further an anti-racist form of policing, one that values everybody in an equitable and equal way,"" Kraynick said, ""including people who don't live in Wauwatosa but who come here to work or play or just because they're coming through.""

42,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/649897060/0/indystar/allnews~Indiana-lawmakers-eliminate-fee-for-handgun-carry-permits-one-week-after-FedEx-shooting/,"Lawmakers voted to nix all handgun carry permit fees as part of their massive two-year budget plan Thursday, just a week after the deadliest mass shooting in Indianapolis in 15 years. Meanwhile, attempts to strengthen gun control measures in the wake of the FedEx shooting failed in the waning days of the legislature. Lawmakers previously had made the five-year carry permits free. If Gov. Eric Holcomb signs the budget bill as expected, the $125 lifetime permits would also be free. Usually, some of that money goes toward local police training, so lawmakers back filled the financial loss for local communities in the budget. Those who already have purchased permits will not get their money back. More: In rare bipartisan unity, lawmakers pass state budget with robust K-12 spending In a rare bipartisan move, the budget passed the House by a 96-2 vote and the Senate by a 46-3 vote. In a more than 200-page bill, the handgun provision got little attention during the final budget discussions. The measure didn't go as far as social conservatives in the Statehouse had wanted. House Republicans had introduced and passed a so-called ""constitutional carry"" bill earlier in the legislative session that would have nixed the permit requirement altogether. But despite more than half of the Senate Republican caucus signing on as cosponsors, Senate leaders declined to give the bill a hearing before the deadline on the Senate side, effectively killing the legislation. Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, posted on Facebook earlier this month defending that decision. His main concern was a provision that requires various government agencies to create a database detailing who cannot carry a firearm. He, and others, argued creating that database by the deadline in the bill is not doable. ""Law enforcement believes being able to access this information in the middle of the night during a traffic stop is important and thus, so do I,"" Bray said. ""The bottom line is law enforcement's ability to determine who is prohibited from carrying a concealed weapon is important and this bill does not achieve that."" Meanwhile days earlier, Democrats tried to turn an unrelated bill into a gun control bill that would have mandated universal background checks for gun sales and instituted a ban on the sale of ""assault weapons,"" defined in the bill as ""selective-fire firearms capable of fully automatic, semiautomatic or 35-burst fire at the option of the user."" The suspect in the FedEx shooting that killed eight people used  two AR-15 style rifles, an HM Defense HM15F and Ruger AR-556. Both of those are semi-automatic. Rep. Ed Delaney, D-Indianapolis, proposed the language Monday during a conference committee meeting between members of both chambers, one of the last steps of the legislative process. The conferee chair Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, rejected the proposal because he said it was not germane to the underlying education bill. ""I’m not in disagreement that we have some tragic things that happened, or a tragic event that happened over the weekend,"" Raatz said. ""I appreciate the thought. We’re going to pass on that."" Delaney argued that the fact that the new language was unrelated to the original bill was not a good enough argument to avoid even voting on gun legislation. ""The public doesn’t really care what bill we put something on; they care that we do something,"" Delaney said. ""And that’s our internal problem. I don’t think that should stand in the way of dealing with this issue that the public wants action."" It should be noted that earlier this week Republicans added language outlawing vaccine passports for many government employees into an unrelated bill that dealt with insurance issues. At least 18 gun bills were filed at the start of the Indiana legislative session — some strengthening and some loosening gun restrictions. None made it across the finish line.

Illinois left-wing activist James Hodgkinson, who tried to kill more than two dozen congressional Republicans, volunteers and police at a Virginia baseball field in 2017 before being gunned down by responding officers, was known to frequently make anti-Trump and anti-GOP posts on social media. The 66-year-old also wrote numerous letters to his hometown newspaper, the Belleville News-Democrat, blasting conservatives and their policy between 2008 and 2012. He wrote that he loved then-President Barack Obama and Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC show, as well as the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests – while calling former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney ""traitors to their country.""

But following the assassination attempt, which nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise and Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika, as well as leaving two others with gunshot wounds and the gunman dead, the paper published a collection of the attacker’s letters on its website to shed some light on his views. The thwarted 2017 mass shooting is gaining renewed attention after Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, who was present at the shooting, revealed during a House Intelligence Committee hearing last week that the FBI had concluded it had been an attempt at ""suicide by cop.""

""I have never said ‘life sucks,’ only the policies of the Republicans,"" he wrote to the News-Democrat on Aug. 28, 2012 Before the shooting, he asked whether the people on the ballfield were Republicans or Democrats, and during a 10-minute gunbattle, he moved ""tactically"" and tried to fight off responding officers with an overwhelming supply of ammunition, witnesses told Fox news. In his letters, he often bashed Republicans and called for increasing taxes on the rich. ""There’s a new version of what GOP stands for,"" he wrote on Dec. 28 2011. ""It’s not the Grand Old Party anymore. It’s the Greedy One Percenters.""

46,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-slowed-mass-shootings-colorado-california-they-re-back-here-ncna1265174," Follow think More from NBC © 2021 NBCNEWS.COM March of 2020 will forever be remembered as the month the World Health Organization’s director-general officially declared that Covid-19 was a global pandemic. But as a mass shooting researcher, I will remember it as the month mass shootings stopped. This narrow definition isolates a specific type of shooter — one who plans to kill as many people as possible by controlling the place, the guns, the time and the ammunition. Americans watched in horror as an unknown virus without a cure turned cities like Los Angeles and New York City into ghost towns. Meanwhile, countries around the globe closed their borders while businesses and schools sent billions of people home to wait out the pandemic. Because Americans were disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus, we depended on the media to alert us to new outbreaks and how to stay safe. Potential mass shooters were likely as captivated by this news as you and I. The FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit defines classic mass shootings as four or more gun fatalities in a public setting. This narrow definition isolates a specific type of shooter — one who plans to kill as many people as possible by controlling the place, the guns, the time and the ammunition. This shooter is also often very concerned with how the media covers other mass shooters and how the media will cover his (and it’s almost always his) crime. We know this because mass shooters often communicate their fame-seeking fantasies and desire for media attention in letters left behind, online and in interrogations. Mass shooters even refer to other mass shooters. Some researchers have linked media coverage to massacres, others posit that “media” itself is the contagion. What’s clear is that even though less than one percent of all gun deaths are caused by a mass shooting, coverage of such dramatic events can lead to imitation. The media and mass shooters must co-exist; journalists must cover mass shootings because they are newsworthy. On the other hand, how we describe mass shootings is powerful. The way a story is told can mislead audiences, distort perceptions and contribute to stereotypes about things like mental illness. It is rare for a mass shooter to be delusional, for example. Rather, mass murderers are usually men with substance misuse problems who perceive themselves as being unjustly treated, are rigid, obsessive, self-involved, narcissistic and suspicious. This type of hateful predator craves attention and wants to be famous. So it is not a coincidence that after years of increases, mass shooters stopped killing while the Covid-19 outbreaks rolled throughout America. This doesn’t mean that gun violence went away during the pandemic — in fact, shooting deaths reached record highs in 2020. But the high-profile, high-casualty mass shootings — like the Dayton entertainment district and the El Paso Walmart shooting that occurred within a 24 hour time period — seemed to fade away. So where did they go? For one thing, the public has a short attention span. We seem to be able to pay attention to the leading two or three stories, and that's it. So there may not have been room for mass shooting discussions. The public has a short attention span. We seem to be able to pay attention to the leading two or three stories, and that's it. On March 16, 2020, a mass shooting in Missouri killed five, including the gunman. But then the world shut down due to Covid-19. This focus left room for maybe one to two other topics. But any remaining attention was more than monopolized by the frenzied coverage of former President Donald Trump, as well as the massive protests following the murder of George Floyd. The Capitol riot in January was a rather fitting capstone. On March 16, 2021, exactly one year later, an angry white man embarked on a killing spree in Atlanta, targeting massage parlors. Six days later, another mass shooting occurred at a Boulder grocery store; nine days later there was a shooting at an Orange, Calif., office complex. Within two weeks, a gunman opened fire at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Covid-19 is not gone, of course (and neither, technically, is Trump), but both are no longer the only storylines Americans care about. And with the return of mass shootings returns the question that plagued America before the pandemic. How do we prevent these utterly horrific scenes from repeating? On the policy front, we must once again take up the most promising gun reform initiatives, such as universal background checks, red flag orders and the prohibition of assault weapons and large capacity magazines. But on the societal and cultural front, we need to re-evaluate — perhaps permanently — how we talk about sensational violence. This must start with journalists, who need to stick to the facts and not glorify or sensationalize. Agreeing on editorial standards, like refraining from using the perpetrator’s name and not speculating about how events in the shooter’s life may have contributed to the event, will help as well. Humanize the victims, not the perpetrator. Let’s not give these murderers the one thing so many of them want — to be famous.

47,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/apr/24/sikh-members-stunned-by-another-shooting/,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Ajeet Singh had to steel himself for a return to work at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis on Tuesday for the first time since a former employee shot eight people dead, including four members of Indianapolis' tightly knit Sikh community. ""I've been scared to go back,"" Singh said. ""I don't know why this happened still. Was it random, or was it because of who I am?"" While the motive for last week's rampage remains under investigation, leaders and members of the Sikh community say they feel a collective trauma and believe more must be done to combat the bigotry, bias and violence they have suffered for decades in the country. Amid intense pain, they're channeling their grief into demands for gun reform and tougher hate crime statutes, and calls for outsiders to educate themselves about their Sikh neighbors. ""We are time and time again disproportionately facing senseless and often very targeted attacks,"" said Satjeet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition, a New York-based group that has urged investigators to examine bias as a possible motive in the shootings. ""The impact on the community is traumatic,"" she continued, ""not just particularly the families that face the senseless violence but also in the community at large because it's community trauma."" ASKED FOR LIAISON In the days since the shootings, the coalition facilitated a call with federal officials in which Sikh leaders in Indiana asked for the appointment of a Sikh American liaison in the White House Office of Public Engagement, among other requests. A monotheistic faith founded more than 500 years ago in India's Punjab region, Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest religion with about 25 million followers, including about 500,000 worshippers in the United States. Kaur said that as a relatively young faith with a low population in the Western world, Sikhism is generally not taught in schools to the same extent as other global religions or integrated in policy-making, resulting in misunderstanding and ignorance. Anti-Sikh discrimination can manifest itself in everything from schoolyard bullying and verbal attacks to shocking acts of violence. Last year a man accused of running over the Sikh owner of a suburban Denver liquor store after reportedly telling him and his wife to ""go back to your country"" was charged with a hate crime and 16 other counts including attempted murder. BECAUSE OF HIS TURBAN The latest killings dredged up painful memories for Rana Singh Sodhi, an Indian immigrant living in Arizona. He has spent nearly two decades preaching love and tolerance after his brother was shot dead four days after 9/11 by a man who mistook him for a Muslim because of his turban. Balbir Singh Sodhi was the first of scores of Sikhs who were the target of hate crimes in the aftermath of the 2001 terror attacks. ""It's very painful,"" Rana Singh Sodhi said. ""I hope one day ... people will love each other and enjoy the life and working together and living together in this beautiful country."" There are between 8,000 and 10,000 Sikh Americans in Indiana, where they began settling more than 50 years ago and opened their first house of worship, known as a gurdwara, in 1999. Most of the employees at the FedEx warehouse are members of the community. Gurinder Singh Khalsa of the Indiana-based Sikh Political Action Committee said many Sikhs live on Indianapolis' west and south sides, making the facility's airport location a convenient place to work. TO FEEL SAFE On Monday his committee said it had set up a task force to seek answers about the shooting and to press government officials to take action. An important goal, Khalsa said, is to help people returning to work feel safe. That would be a relief to people like Gaganpal Singh Dhaliwal, who said two of his aunts had just arrived for their shift at the warehouse when the shooting started. His mother also works there. They all survived, but he's mourning colleagues and friends. Dhaliwal expressed hope that the tragedy will inspire others to understand the religion and cultural practices better: ""To all my fellow Americans, whether Republicans, Democrats, Muslims, Jewish, nonreligious people, everyone: Google the word 'Sikh' today. ... Devote five minutes of your time to be aware about another people around you who may not look like you."" Already he's starting to see some signs of raised consciousness, notably in the flags flying at half-staff outside houses and businesses across Indianapolis and an ""outpouring"" of support to fundraisers for victims' families. He urged more people to build bridges to his community. 'GO TALK TO THEM' ""If you see a person like me wearing a [turban] on the head -- in your street, in your grocery shop, at your workplace -- go talk to them,"" Dhaliwal said. ""Tell them you know who Sikhs are, or give them a hug and say, 'Hey, you're welcome in the U.S.' Right now we're a community that needs a lot of support, and to know that we have a place in this place called America."" The killings have reverberated nationwide. Pardeep Singh Kaleka, executive director of the Interfaith Conference of Greater Milwaukee and the son of one of seven fatal victims of a 2012 mass shooting at a gurdwara in the suburb of Oak Creek, Wis., said there are concerns about an escalating threat of violence. Small communities traumatized by violence are left to wonder, ""Was I targeted for my race?"" Kaleka said. ""Was I targeted for my ethnicity, for my religion? Was I targeted for something I can't control?"" And in California, Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal, a Stockton Gurdwara Sahib member and student of early Sikh American history, said he's grappling with a range of emotions including ""anger, hurt, hopelessness and a feeling of not belonging."" Frustrating, he said, is that much of the public focus has been on the shooter's mental state rather than the community he wounded so deeply. TOLD TO 'FIT IN' ""I am tired of the same old narrative,"" said Bainiwal, who was born and raised in the United States but has been told to ""fit in."" In Indianapolis, the Sikh community is focusing on helping the bereaved, who are hoping to secure roughly two-dozen fast-tracked visas so relatives overseas can travel for funeral rites set to take place in the next two weeks. The proceedings will begin with cremation and then be followed by up to 20 days of reading of the 1,400-page Guru Granth Sahib scripture, Dhaliwal said. Earlier last week the home of Sukhpreet Rai bustled with happy chatter and kitchen activity amid celebrations of Vaisakhi, a major Sikh holiday festival, and a forthcoming family birthday. Now it has fallen silent in mourning for two of her relatives, Jasvinder Kaur and Amarjit Sekhon. ""We were supposed to be celebrating a birthday and being together as a family,"" Rai said. ""We're together, and we have one another, but it's for something different -- it's for a funeral.""

48,https://www.nationalmemo.com/biden-young-voter-approval,"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden with soccer players Megan Rapinoe and Margaret Purce Reprinted with permission from American Independent A new poll of younger voters reveals that they strongly back President Joe Biden and the Democratic congressional majority, while more than two-thirds of them disapprove of congressional Republicans. For 21 years, the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School has surveyed young Americans through its Harvard Youth Poll. The results of its spring 2021 poll, released Friday, reveal adults under age 30 ""overwhelmingly approve of the job President Biden is doing, favor progressive policies, and have faith in their fellow Americans."" Three-fifths of voters aged 18-29 approve of Biden's overall job performance, 59 percent to 38 percent — slightly higher even than President Barack Obama's numbers in the institute's 2009 poll. Among college students who are registered to vote, 63 percent approve of Biden's performance, a higher level of support than any attained in the poll by George W. Bush, Obama, or Donald Trump. The results show growing support for progressive policies, including double-digit increases over the past five years in support for climate action, government spending to reduce poverty, and universal health care. Young voters identify with the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a 41 percent to 22 percent plurality; 40 percent say they lean more liberal, contrasted with 27 percent who lean more conservative. While just 36 percent of participants say they consider themselves ""politically engaged or politically active,"" 41 percent say they will definitely vote in the 2022 midterms, and another 19 percent say they'll probably do so. This would be good news for the Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. Younger voters approve of Democrats in Congress by a 52-45 percent majority, while they disapprove of congressional Republicans by a 69-28 percent supermajority. By a 53-14 percent spread, they view the Republican Party as ""too extreme."" They also say they have an unfavorable view of Trump, by a 65-28 percent margin; 54 percent say that history should evaluate Trump as a ""bad president,"" ""terrible president,"" or the ""worst president ever,"" while just 26 percent say he should be deemed ""good"" or better. This growing progressive sentiment among younger votes comes as young people have taken the lead on issues of racial justice, climate action, and gun safety — and been attacked by prominent Republicans for doing so. Trump and his team repeatedly bullied teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, raging after she was named Time magazine's Person of the Year. Trump said the then-16-year-old in December 2019 had ""anger management"" issues and needed to ""chill."" Last October, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) attacked David Hogg, a 20-year-old survivor of the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, and an activist against gun violence, calling him ""functionally illiterate"" for criticizing Trump's separation of immigrant kids from their families. In January, footage resurfaced of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) confronting Hogg in March 2019, accusing him of ""using kids"" to ""attack the Second Amendment"" and branding him a ""coward"" for not responding to her taunts. Republican lawmakers around the country have also sought to suppress student voting by shutting down early voting sites on campuses, refusing to accept student IDs as valid for voter identification, and prohibiting students from registering at their college addresses.

49,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/24/are-mass-shootings-an-american-epidemic_partner/,"This article was originally published on The Conversation. The U.S. has suffered yet another mass shooting, with a deadly attack in a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. This was the fifth mass shooting in five weeks, including a shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado that took the lives of 10 people on March 22 and just days earlier, eight people were killed in a series of shootings at spas in Atlanta, Georgia. Public outcry about gun violence, gun rights and racism and what to do about these issues is high. As a criminal justice researcher, I study gun purchasing and mass shootings, and it's clear to me that these events are traumatic for victims, families, communities and the nation as a whole. But despite the despair about their slightly growing frequency, they are actually uncommon incidents that account for just 0.2% of firearm deaths in the U.S. each year. Mass shootings are rare Killings are not the only kind of gun violence, and are in fact a relative rarity when compared with other forms of gun violence in the U.S. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 470,840 people were victims of crimes that involved a firearm in 2018, and 481,950 in 2019. Each person is counted separately, even if several of them were part of the same incident, and this tally does not require the gun to be fired or anyone to be killed. When it comes to people killed by firearms, police data reported to the FBI estimates that guns were used in 10,258 of the 13,927 homicides that occurred in 2019. That's much higher than even the uppermost count of mass shootings in 2019, the 417 recorded by the Gun Violence Archive. That group counts all incidents in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter, regardless of whether the shooter is killed or injured. It also includes events that involve gang violence or armed robbery, as well as shootings that occurred in public or in private homes, as many domestic violence shootings do. A Mother Jones magazine database that defines mass shootings more restrictively lists only 10 for 2019. Even the FBI's own data – which uses yet another set of criteria focused on people who continue to shoot more people over the course of an incident – records just 28 active shooter incidents in 2019.  The most recent research on frequency of mass shootings indicates they are becoming more common, though the exact number each year can vary widely. But not all experts agree. Some argue that mass shootings have not increased and that reports of an increase are due to differences in research methods, such as determining which events are appropriate to count in the first place. Speaking about school shootings specifically in a 2018 interview, two gun violence researchers said that those events have not become more common – but rather, people have become more aware of them. The same may be true of mass shootings more generally. In any case, some researchers have found that mass shootings are becoming more deadly, with more victims in recent attacks.  Suicide is the leading form of gun death In 2019, the 417 mass shootings tallied by the Gun Violence Archive resulted in 465 deaths. By contrast, 14,414 people were killed by someone else with a gun in 2019. And 23,941 people intentionally killed themselves with a gun in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every year, homicides – one person killing another – make up about 35% of gun deaths. More than 60% of gun deaths are suicides. Mass shootings can get more attention than these other, more common, types of firearm deaths both because of human nature and the news media. People are naturally curious about violent events that appear random, with no clear explanation. Those incidents often spark fears about whether similar things could happen to them, and a resulting desire to know more in an effort to understand. In addition, cases with higher death counts or unusual characteristics, such as a shooter manifesto or video footage, are more likely to get press attention and extended coverage. Americans' opinions are split on whether mass shootings are isolated incidents or part of a broader societal problem. And Americans are divided about how to reduce their frequency. A 2017 poll found that 47% of adults believed that reducing the number of guns in the U.S. would reduce the number of mass shootings. But a follow-up question revealed that 75% of American adults believe that someone who wants to hurt or kill others will find a way to do it whether they have access to a firearm or not. With those diverging views, it will be hard to develop solutions that will be effective nationwide. That doesn't mean nothing will change, but it does mean the political debates will likely continue.

50,https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-mortal-kombat-made-america-lose-its-mind?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH In honor of the new ‘Mortal Kombat’ film, let’s take a look back at the time Congress held emergency hearings on video-game violence timed to ‘Mortal Kombat II.’ In 1994, Richard D. Heffner, the chairman of the Motion Picture Ratings Association of America and the creator of PBS staple The Open Mind, wrote a column for The New York Times excoriating the rise of violence in video games, then an emerging entertainment product quickly colonizing the homes of families across America. He was very, very worried about where video games would lead us: Every indication is that these newer technologies will bring ever more outrageous material into our homes—the kind of material Americans have tolerated until now only because it has been kept at a distance… Short of censorship, what then is the solution for the excesses of cable and the new interactive entertainment? It may be as simple as it is painful for those whose only concern is to maximize profits. It is to just say no. Don’t produce degrading materials; don’t trade in them; don’t seek merely to rate them, passing them off on parents and children; don’t profit at all from them, at such an enormous cost to our national life. To all those who dismiss such an approach as futile, reminiscent of Nancy Reagan’s appropriately maligned response to the drug problem, consider: Would these “entertainers” really choose instead to risk the biggest battle over free expression this nation has ever known? The social and psychological impact of violence in video games, Heffner insisted, was uncontrollable by the same industry ratings systems that had worked for movies. The video game industry, if it continued down its current path, would impregnate the American spirit with the demon of censorship. This medium, and the terrors it brings into the home, was a threat to freedom of speech itself. This was the game he was talking about, by the way: Mortal Kombat II, a massive arcade hit that was released for consoles and immediately became public enemy number one among pearl-clutching moralizers worried that an extraordinarily stupid, nihilistic, tongue-in-cheek fighting game would mass-brainwash children into becoming bare-handed boxing, spine-extracting deviants. Our kids didn’t model their conduct after Raiden, and the terrors of video game violence didn’t transform us into Gilead. Strangely enough, Mortal Kombat is not even one of the more violent video games that springs to mind. In fact, this weekend, Warner Brothers and HBO will be releasing a new Mortal Kombat movie. If you went back in time and told people that a gory Mortal Kombat movie would be made someday, they would be shocked. Because in 1993, Mortal Kombat seemed like it was going to destroy civilization. Just ask Joe Lieberman, who said on the floor of the Senate, “Like the Grinch who stole Christmas, these violent video games threaten to rob this particular holiday season of a spirit of goodwill.” Lieberman, a hack senator who never found a censorship related crusade he couldn’t get behind, commissioned a Senate hearing on violence in video games around the time that Mortal Kombat II came to home consoles, after being the biggest coin-op arcade game for a year. But, in anticipation of Mortal Monday, Sega had already opted to self regulate and institute a ratings system, the bare bones of which remain in place to this day, while Nintendo was already known for the strict regulation of violence on their platform. This made the hearings an outlet for Lieberman and other senators to spew fearmongering, evening news-ready soundbites versus a constructive legislative exercise designed to craft policy. During the hearing, Lieberman fixates on an ad for Mortal Kombat, rated MA-13 (for players ages 13 and up) under the new ratings system, wherein a nerd plays Mortal Kombat and becomes cool, insisting, against all reason, that this ad is actually aimed at children, since Lieberman is pretty sure that the kid in the ad is under 13. The kid doesn’t look a day under 13, and you can even hear in Lieberman’s cracking voice the acknowledgment that this is a stretch. In one of the many discursions regarding Night Trap, a silly full-motion video game and slasher-movie satire that was released for the Sega CD, Lieberman asks Sega of America president Bill White, who comes in for most of the committee’s grilling, if he thought the game was suitable for children. White says no, but that adults also play video games. The senators don’t buy it. Also not buying it was Nintendo of America president Howard Lincoln, who saw his company as family-friendly. When Night Trap came up, he insisted that the game would never be released on a Nintendo platform (whoops!), and accused White of ignoring demographic information he would have been made aware of as a former Nintendo employee. Nintendo took the middle road, as far as Mortal Kombat was concerned. They did release the game for Super Nintendo, but insisted that blood be removed and the fatality sequences be pared down. Customers were mad that they’d received an inferior product, but it let Lincoln and the company avoid blame when the Senate came knocking. (There’s a reason they demolished Sega.) The Mortal Kombat moral panic didn’t take place in a vacuum. In the mid-’90s, there was a sense that the entire culture was irredeemably soaked in violence and nihilism. Writing for the Times in 1994, critic David Browne tied Mortal Kombat’s exploding frozen-body kills to Y2K fears, Beavis and Butt-Head, and the burgeoning career of Quentin Tarantino: Some computer games, like “Mortal Kombat,” have grown so bloody that the videogame industry, after a few strong hints from the Government, has instituted a ratings system… From the mosh pit to “death metal” rock to the urban brawls of gangster rap, pop music has never sounded so aggressive and intense. Its clattering noise, using samples of grinding guitars, is the sound of civilization falling apart. The electronic dance music known as techno is nothing but a series of disconnected, computerized bleeps and groans -- the soundtrack for a world in which phone sex is taking the place of human interaction. Mass shootings would become de rigueur in America, not because shooters were inspired by video games available all over the world. Some grifters, including our deeply stupid former president, have placed blame for mass shootings at the doorstep of video games. But really, America’s mass-shooting problem redounds upon the United States Senate, the same institution cynically moralizing at video game executives because they are pretty sure the kid in that commercial was supposed to be 12, not 13, being held in thrall to an American right wing that regards any regulation of gun ownership as a breach of their civil rights. “The intent, with the Sega video game rating system, and the independent council, and the packaging guidelines we’ve established, Senator, is to take a first step,” White says to the committee. “And we’re proud of that step we’ve taken.” But as it turned out, it was… the only step. Violence in video games was not reduced. Check out a clip from the latest Mortal Kombat: This is significantly more violent than the 16-bit bone explosions Sub-Zero was working with back in 1993. And yet here we are, living in a world where no one from Warner Brothers Interactive, the studio that made Mortal Kombat 11, or Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft, the three major video game hardware manufacturers who host distribute MK11 on their platforms, is being dragged in front of Chuck Grassley and made to account for the horrors they’re exposing our children to. What happened? Why doesn’t anyone care about violence in video games anymore? For one, it’s a matter of demographics. White was clearly stretching when he told a bunch of senators that video games were a product for adults in the early ‘90s. But the kids who grew up on 16-bit fantasias never really stopped, and the medium came to be seen less as “a toy” and more like another form of media, such as movies or books, that has products for kids and equally popular products aimed at teens and adults. This widening of audience has led to a widening of themes. With every successive leap in gaming technology, developers have continued to utilize violence, even unnervingly realistic violence, as a tool. But they have also integrated sophisticated narratives to accompany that violence, the kind that doubles back and forces the player to question the actions of the character they’re ostensibly controlling. Or maybe, they even serve a political purpose. The monumentally popular Call of Duty series sticks the player in the seat of a military operator, doing dirty deeds on behalf of the U.S. military. Activision, who develops the game, has even consulted with the Pentagon in their quest to build a “realistic” vision of U.S. military might. Disgraced National Security Council staff member (and ex-NRA president) Oliver North featured in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, while Call of Duty’s online servers are used as a military recruiting ground. So, Call of Duty, a video game series with startlingly realistic violence, operates as a piece of propaganda for the military and its contractors—the same medium that blowhards like Joe Lieberman chastised in the ‘90s—while Mortal Kombat II was a lurid and stupid fighting game grounded in fantasy. But Mortal Kombat also expanded the reach and perception of video gaming, leading the industry down a path where violence wasn’t just a Beavis and Butt-Head exaltation of nihilism, but an expressive tool of a multifaceted art form. Honestly not bad for a game where a snake man eats his enemies.",2021-04-24 06:06:47,When ‘Mortal Kombat’ Made America Lose Its Mind,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

Ex-NFL player kills himself after killing 5, injuring 1 in South Carolina, police say The primary suspect in a South Carolina mass shooting that left six people dead, including a doctor and two of his grandchildren, earlier this month allegedly left his cellphone at the scene before fleeing, according to newly released search warrants. Deputies responding to the shooting at a Rock Hill residence on the afternoon of April 7 found an iPhone in a red case on the front steps and quickly determined the number was issued to former NFL player Phillip Adams, 32, according to warrants released by the York County Sheriff's Office on Friday. Adams, a Rock Hill native, was living with his parents less than a mile away from the victims' home on the same road, according to search warrant affidavits. Detectives obtained a search warrant for his nearby residence and a SWAT team tried to contact Adams for several hours before he was found dead inside, according to an affidavit. Adams died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot, the York County Sheriff's Office said. The victims of the mass shooting included Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70; his wife, Barbara Lesslie, 69; their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah Lesslie and 5-year-old Noah Lesslie; and James Lewis, 39, an air conditioning tech who was working at the home at the time he was shot, authorities said. A sixth shooting victim who was working outside the home, air conditioning tech Robert Shook, died three days after the incident, according to his employer. In addition to the cellphone, investigators further connected Adams to the shooting after a responding police officer passed a man driving away from the crime scene who matched the description of the suspect provided by a witness, according to an affidavit. The driver was wearing a black motorcycle helmet that matched one later seized inside Adams' residence. Investigators also seized two rifle-style guns -- a .45-caliber ""Tommy Gun""-style firearm and a 9mm-caliber ""MP5""-style firearm -- under a couch in the sunroom of Adams' residence that matched the description provided by Shook, the sixth victim killed, and were the same calibers believed to be used by the suspect in the homicide, according to an affidavit. The State Law Enforcement Division later determined that one of the guns seized -- the 9mm ""MP5""-style firearm -- was a match for some of the casings located on the scene of the mass shooting, according to an affidavit. Authorities didn't find a .45-caliber firearm at Adams' residence that matched other casings at the scene, according to the documents. Over the course of two searches at Adams' residence, conducted on April 7 and April 14, detectives seized nine firearms, several magazines, dozens of rounds of ammunition, two iPads, a Macbook and medicine, among other items, according to the warrant records. In Adams' room, investigators also found ""numerous notebooks ... with cryptic writing with different designs and emblems,"" according to an affidavit. ""Detectives had also learned that Phillip Adams had been acting differently and possibly following a new religion or ideology. ... Detectives were unclear if this was a potential motive or if there was another motive involved."" Investigators also found a can of tobacco dip in Adams' bedroom that was consistent with one believed to be left behind by the shooter at the crime scene, according to an affidavit. Detectives additionally sought medical records for Adams and his parents from Riverview Family Medicine, which was the practice of Robert Lesslie, one of the victims killed, to potentially help determine a motive for the shooting, according to an affidavit. Investigators seized unspecified medical documents from the practice on April 13, warrant records show. Additional details were not provided. A search warrant also was issued for a gun safe left behind in Adams' former Charlotte residence, but nothing was seized, according to the documents. Adams was drafted by San Francisco in the seventh round out of South Carolina State in 2010 and played as a reserve defensive back for five teams in six years from 2010 to 2015. He will be tested for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, commonly known as CTE, a degenerative brain disease found in those with a history of repetitive brain trauma, according to the York County Coroner's Office. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-04-24 14:48:09,Former NFL player allegedly left cellphone at scene of mass shooting: Warrants,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
53,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/24/living-in-a-country-haunted-by-death_partner/,"This piece originally appeared on TomDispatch. Fifty-four years ago, standing at the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York City, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his now-famous ""Beyond Vietnam"" sermon. For the first time in public, he expressed in vehement terms his opposition to the American war in Vietnam. He saw clearly that a foreign policy defined by aggression hurt the poor and dispossessed across the planet. But it did more than that. It also drained this country of its moral vitality and the financial resources needed to fight poverty at home. On that early spring day, exactly one year before his assassination in 1968, Dr. King warned that ""a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death,"" a statement that should ring some bells in April 2021. In his sermon, Dr. King openly wrestled with a thorny problem: how to advance nonviolent struggle among a generation of Black youth whose government had delivered little but pain and empty promises. He told the parishioners of Riverside Church that his years of work, both in the South and the North, had opened his eyes to why, as a practitioner of nonviolence, he had to speak out against violence everywhere — not just in the U.S. — if he expected people to take him at his word. As he explained that day: ""As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems… But they asked, and rightly so, 'what about Vietnam?' They asked if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today: my own government."" A Global Pandemic Cries Out for Global Cooperation In 2020, the planet was swept up in a devastating pandemic. Millions died, tens of millions suffered. It was a moment, in Reverend King's spirit, that would have been ideal for imagining new global approaches to America's ongoing wars of the past century. It would similarly have been the perfect moment to begin imagining global cooperative approaches to public health, growing debt and desperation, and intellectual property rights. This especially given that the Covid-19 vaccines had been patented for mega-profits and were available only to some on this suffering planet of ours, a world vulnerable to a common enemy in which the fault lines in any country threaten the safety of many others. Internationally, at the worst moment imaginable, U.S.-backed institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund continued to demand billions of dollars in debt payments from impoverished countries in the Global South, only forgiving them when their governments fell into step behind the U.S. and Europe, as Sudan has recently done. Moreover, Washington had a golden opportunity when the search for a Covid-19 vaccine threatened to change patent laws and force pharmaceutical companies to work with low-income nations. Instead, the U.S. government backed exclusive deals with Big Pharma, ensuring that vaccine apartheid would become rampant in this country, as well as across the rest of the world. By late March, 90% of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered had gone to people in wealthy or middle-income countries, with vaccine equity within those countries being a concern as well. Another menacing development is the thematically anti-Chinese legislation being developed in Congress right now. Three weeks ago, just as the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) was nearly across the finish line, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was quietly laying the groundwork for another major legislative package focused on further inflaming a rising cold war with China. For Republicans, legislative action on China is in theory an absolute bullseye, but Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has already made it clear that his support for Schumer's bill will only come if it includes a large increase — once again — in ""defense"" spending. The timing and tenor of this debate, steeped as it is in Sinophobia, economic brinkmanship, and military hawkishness, is more than troublesome. Just a few weeks ago, eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were gunned down in Atlanta by a man plagued by his own toxic mix of religious extremism, white supremacy, and sexism. This followed a year in which there were close to 4,000 documented anti-Asian hate incidents in this country, fueled by a president who blamed the Chinese for Covid-19 and regularly used racist nicknames for the pandemic like the ""Chinese virus"" and the ""kung flu."" In addition, an aggressive and potentially militarized anti-China bill is irresponsible when tens of thousands continue to contract the virus daily here at home and we are only beginning to understand the long-term economic consequences of the pandemic. At a time when there are 140 million poor or low-income people in this country, a fully revived and funded war not against China but against poverty should be seen as both a moral responsibility and a material necessity. At least now, poverty seems to be getting some attention in the pandemic era, but how sad that it took the disastrous toll of Covid-19 on American jobs, housing, and nutrition to put poverty on the national agenda. Now that it's there, though, we can't allow it to be sidelined by short-sighted preparations for a new cold war that could get hot. Cruel Manipulation of the Poor An inhumane approach to foreign policy and especially wars in distant lands was only half of the spiritual death that Dr. King warned about back in 1967: the other half was how the militarization of this society and a distortion of its moral priorities had brought war and immiseration home. That was what he meant in his sermon when spoke about the ""cruel manipulation of the poor."" In 1967, King saw how American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam ""on the side of the wealthy and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor."" That hell was being created both in the Agent Orange-saturated lands of Vietnam and Laos and, in a different fashion, in so many poor and abandoned communities in the United States. Dr. King mourned the ""brutal solidarity"" of disproportionately poor Black, Brown, and white Americans fighting together against the poor in Vietnam, only to return to a nation parts of which were still committed to inequality, discrimination, and racism (despite the struggle and advances of the Civil Rights movement) and remarkably blind to their suffering. In those last years of the 1960s, he watched as the promise of President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty was betrayed by massive investments in what President Dwight D. Eisenhower had first dubbed a ""military-industrial complex,"" and in a reactionary narrative, which would only become more emboldened in the years to come, that blamed the poor for their poverty. Sadly, the decades to follow would, in so many ways, affirm his fears. And yet — to note a spark of hope amid the pandemic gloom — the last year has finally awakened an earnest concern on the part of some in the government to revive the spiritual health of the nation by committing in significant ways to the material health of the poor. Indeed, ARPA's investments in poor and low-income communities should be celebrated, but the question remains: Why is the Biden administration's Covid-19 legislation so historic and rare? Why is it so unprecedented for the U.S. to invest $1.9 trillion in our own people in a country that, in these last years, has squandered 53% of every federal discretionary dollar on the Pentagon? How is it that we've become so steeped in a militarized economy that we don't bat an eye when politicians propose more funding for the military, even as they say spending on human welfare is irresponsible and unaffordable? In the lead-up to the passage of ARPA, stalwart old guard Republicans attacked the legislation. In an op-ed for the National Review, Senator Marco Rubio denounced increased welfare spending as ""not pro-family"" and repeated the tired myth that welfare, by supposedly creating dependency, actually breaks up the nuclear family. So immersed was Rubio in his disdain for the poor that he punctuated his piece with this nonsensical claim: ""If pulling families out of poverty were as simple as handing moms and dads a check, we would have solved poverty a long time ago."" Is it really necessary to affirm in 2021 that more money in people's pockets actually does mean less poverty? Meanwhile, longtime senior Democratic economic adviser and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that the Covid-19 bill was the ""least responsible"" policy in four decades. He had, of course, long been a champion of the austerity policies that helped lead to enormous increases in inequality and poverty in this country. (Many other economists dispute his claim.) It's telling as well that members of the Biden Administration have distanced themselves from him. Pro-austerity and anti-poor economic policies promoted by influential figures like Rubio and Summers are, in part, what's kept America in a spiritual death spiral since the days of Dr. King. A country now constantly haunted by death has long been consumed by violence and crisis. Sometimes, it's the literal physical violence of another mass shooting, driven by rage, hate, and desperation, or the further militarization of the border, or the use of militarized police violence to clear the most vulnerable from homeless encampments. Other times it's policy violence, whether involving punitive work requirements for food stamps or the refusal to expand Medicaid and make healthcare available and affordable to all. And always, in the background, as Dr. King would certainly have noted, if he were giving his sermon today, is the violence of America's never-ending wars that have eaten so many trillion dollars and killed and displaced so many people in distant lands. Of particular concern today is the potential death of democracy that the insurrectionof January 6th at the Capitol seemed so ominously to signal. I will never forget listening to a long-time organizer in Flint, Michigan, explain that ""before they took away our water, they had to take away our democracy."" This was true in the fight for racial justice, welfare, and decent wages during the days of Dr. King and it's no less true in our many human rights struggles today. After all, since 2020, at least 45 states have introduced voter suppression bills, with the recent one in Georgia being only the most egregious and publicized. Such legislation is being proposed and passed by extremist politicians who understand that limiting access to the ballot through racism and a demonization of the poor is the surest way to prevent real and lasting change. A Moral Revolution of Values Immediately after cautioning about the spiritual death of the nation in that classic sermon of his, Dr. King made an abrupt and hopeful turn, reminding his audience that a moral revolution of values was urgently needed and that ""America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war."" As both a preacher and theologian, he was acutely aware of the story of Jesus. After all, Dr. King, like the Jesus of the Bible, knew that a transformation of society in the image of peace would involve a full-scale reordering of priorities, dependent on a willingness to reject a politics of death and embrace one of life. For that to happen, however, society would need to be flipped right side up and that, in Jesus's time, in Dr. King's, or in our own, represents a herculean task, one never likely to happen based on the goodwill of those in power. It requires the collective efforts of a movement of people committed to saving the heart and soul of their society. In this moment following Easter Sunday 2021, 53 years after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., may we listen to his concerns and honor his enduring hopes by committing ourselves to building exactly such a movement here and now.

The shooting occurred at 2:37 p.m. at Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, said Officer Rosario Cervantes of the Media Relations Section. Officers were en route to a radio call with their lights and sirens on when a car pulled in front of them, stopped suddenly and backed into the patrol car, police officials said. The driver of the car got out and was observed wearing body armor as he moved toward the officers, who had exited their car, police said. The suspect had his right hand hidden behind his back, counted backwards from three and was moving his arm forward before officers fired at him, officials said. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. KCAL9 reported that the man was not armed. Sunset Boulevard was shut down in the area while Force Investigation Division detectives conducted interviews and collected evidence. Early Friday, officers investigating a call about a man armed with knife shot and wounded the suspect. The shooting was reported around 2:30 a.m. Friday in the 5200 block of Whitsett Avenue, near Magnolia Boulevard, police said “Officers responded to a call of a man armed (with) a knife,” police said in a statement. “When they encountered the man, they used less lethal munitions which were not effective (and) an OIS (officer-involved shooting) occurred. The man was struck by gunfire (and) taken to a local hospital where he is in stable condition.” No other injuries were reported, police said. A knife was recovered at the scene. Officers found the suspect on a sidewalk after he apparently fell from a balcony, still holding a knife, Fox11 reported. Get the latest news delivered daily!

News By Kathianne Boniello Submit April 25, 2021 | 1:57am				| Updated April 25, 2021 | 1:57am The head of the union for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is lashing out at an Indiana prosecutor he says failed to use the state’s “red flag” gun law against the alleged FedEx shooter. Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears has admitted his office declined to pursue a competency hearing against Brandon Hole, 19, last year, as allowed under the gun law. Such a hearing could have been held when a shotgun was seized from Hole last year after his mother told cops she feared he wanted to commit suicide by cop, officials said. The lack of hearing cleared the way for Hole to legally purchase the two weapons he used in the massacre, the police union head is complaining, according to local station WLKY. The FedEx massacre left eight people dead. “Why didn’t the prosecutor seek the hearing that the statute requires? Why didn’t the prosecutor use all the legal tools available? Why didn’t the prosecutor try?” said Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police President Rick Snyder, who added that Mears “failed to do his part.” Under the law, prosecutors would have had to bring their case against Hole to a judge within 14 days, and convince them Hole had a “high propensity for violence.” If they failed, Hole would have gotten the gun back. “In this particular situation, we had a case where it was just a single incident, there weren’t any other incidents reported to us, the firearm was taken from the home, there was an agreement that firearm wouldn’t be returned,” Mears said. Indiana Republican state Sen. Erin Houchin told WLKY the law “could have worked just as it should” in the case of the eventual FedEx shooter. “I think that had the prosecutor followed the red flag procedure in this case, then this 19-year-old might have not been able to purchase a second firearm after the family did voluntarily turn over that weapon,” Houchin said.

56,https://newsone.com/4144077/questions-remain-in-phillip-adams-case/,"Posted April 25, 2021 Source: Tom Szczerbowski / Getty Family members of former football player Phillip Adams want to know if injuries sustained during his NFL carrier could have led to a gruesome mass shooting earlier this month. As officials continue to investigate, family and friends say Adams had a change in attitude. His sister told USA Today there was some obvious deterioration in his mental health. She and his ex-girlfriend observed increased mood changes and mood swings. The change was sudden, and he became more withdrawn from his family. While the family presses for answers, the community of Rock Hill, South Carolina, continues to look after Adams killed a well-respected doctor, his wife, two grandchildren, and two service workers at the home that day. Officers are trying to figure out if a new religious or other ideological interest could cause Adams’ actions. CNN reported local officers found notebooks with “cryptic writing.” Officials also observed designs and emblems. Adams will be evaluated for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a part of his autopsy. The Medical University of South Carolina, in collaboration with Boston University, will conduct the analysis. CTE is a degenerative disorder that can lead to violent mood swings and other cognitive challenges. According to Adams’ father, the former football player was a patient of Dr. Robert Lesslie. It remains unclear why Adams would target the doctor and his family.  But even if Adams had CTE, it still would not explain his killing six people and himself. A 2017 study showed that 99% of deceased players whose brains were studied had CTE. Medical studies have worked to identify CTE in people while they are living. In her interview with USA Today, Adams’ sister Lauren said he was upset about not getting disability benefits from the NFL. Football-related injuries and compensation for former players is an ongoing dispute with some retired players suing the NFL. As previously reported by NewsOne, Black retired players filing dementia allege that an evaluation protocol used by the league resulted in Black retirees being denied at a disproportionate rate compared to white players. Testing methods used by the NFL include a practice called “race-norming,” which operates from a default of assuming Black people have diminished cognitive functioning compared to white people. Because of that assumption, it is harder for Black players to prove diminished cognitive functioning. Per ESPN, Adams’ father told a Charlotte news station that he blamed football for his son’s issues. It’s unclear whether Adams had damage due to long-lasting concussion-related injuries, and results from the autopsy may take a few months.

Across the room hung a portrait of Franklin D Roosevelt, a nod to the transformative presidency Biden envisions for a nation tormented by disease, strife and division.  The $1.9tn package was designed to tame the worst public health crisis in a century and to pave the way for an overhaul of the American economy. It overcame unanimous Republican opposition in Congress, where Democrats hold the barest majority. “This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this nation, working people, middle-class folks, people who built the country, a fighting chance,” Biden said. And with the flick of a pen, he signed into law one of the most expensive economic relief bills in American history. Biden took office at a moment of profound grief and turmoil, inheriting from Donald Trump a virus that has killed more than 550,000 and exposed glaring inequalities in healthcare, education and the economy. Fear and anxiety still gripped the nation in the aftermath of the 6 January insurrection at the Capitol, when Trump loyalists stormed the building in a bloody attempt to stop lawmakers certifying Biden’s electoral victory. All of this amid a generational reckoning on race and the ever-accelerating threat of climate change. One hundred days into his term, Biden’s solution to the myriad crises is an ambitious economic agenda that promises to “own the future” by dramatically expanding the role of government in American life. The White House is guided by the belief that if it can lift the nation from the Covid-19 crisis and the economic havoc it wrought, it can begin to restore Americans’ faith in government and pave the way for the next phase of the Biden presidency. “We need to remember the government isn’t some foreign force in a distant capital,” Biden said in his first primetime address, hours after signing the American Rescue Plan. “It’s us. All of us.” The pandemic remains an inescapable challenge. But the picture is inarguably brighter than it was when Biden delivered his inaugural address in January to a sea of American flags marking the crowds absent from the Mall. Now, Biden is dangling the prospect of backyard barbecues by the Fourth of July. Marshaling a “full-scale, wartime effort”, his administration has built one of the largest and most effective mass immunization campaigns in the world. At its peak the US was administering more than 3m shots a day. In a nation of nearly 330 million, more than 50% of adults including 80% over 65 are at least partially vaccinated. Last week, Biden surpassed his goal of administering 200m shots by his 100th day. The problem is rapidly becoming too much vaccine and not enough people willing to be vaccinated. “That was arguably one of his main jobs as president – to start getting this pandemic under control,” said Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, “It’s not fully under control yet, but it is clearly in much better shape than it would have been had this incredible vaccination effort not happened.” Jha credits the campaign’s success to several factors, from improving coordination between the federal government and states to tweaking the way doses are extracted from vials. He added that such success is due in part to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, which dramatically accelerated vaccine development. Deaths from the coronavirus have declined sharply since a peak in January, as many of the most vulnerable Americans are vaccinated. Yet infections are rising again in many parts of the country. The more contagious B117 variant of the coronavirus that was first discovered in the UK has emerged as the dominant strain in the US, and young people are at particular risk. Even so, a number of Republican states have ignored Biden’s pleas to keep mask mandates and other restrictions in place. Reaching the roughly 130 million Americans who have yet to be inoculated remains a challenge, as demand softens and vaccine hesitancy persists. As of 19 April, all adult Americans became eligible to receive a vaccine, marking what Biden called a “new phase” of the immunization effort. Public health experts are working to confront misinformation and conspiracy theories. The decision by federal health officials to temporarily halt the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after rare instances of blood clots among millions who have received the shot further fueled mistrust in some corners. “The biggest challenge that the administration faces over the next 100 days is in building confidence in people who are not sure they want the vaccine,” Jha said. “That is going to take an enormous amount of effort and, in some ways, it’s much harder than simply building vaccination sites because it’s sociological.” As the vaccine campaigns help Americans push past the pandemic, and the economy begins to show signs of recovery after a year of hardship, Biden is turning to the potentially legacy-defining pieces of his agenda. He plans to spend trillions more on an infrastructure package. “It is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,” Biden said, introducing the first half of a multitrillion-dollar agenda in a speech outside Pittsburgh. “It is a once-in-a-generation investment in America.” The president’s “Build Back Better” agenda widens the definition of infrastructure to include investments in home care, an expansion of broadband and a restructuring of the tax system in addition to more traditional public works projects like roads, bridges and railways. It also represents the cornerstone of Biden’s fight against climate change, which he has called the “the existential crisis of our time”. Embedded throughout the plan are proposals to reduce carbon emissions by investing in green infrastructure and technologies, electric vehicles and clean energy, as well as a clean electricity standard that aims to ​decarbonize the nation’s power sector by 2035 – and the whole economy by mid-century. At a White House virtual climate summit with world leaders, Biden unveiled an ambitious ​new pledge ​to cut US carbon emissions by at least half by 2030. A forthcoming piece of his infrastructure agenda is expected to center on expanding childcare services and making education more affordable and accessible. It too envisions hundreds of billions of dollars of spending. It is perhaps a surprising approach for a man who has spent nearly four decades in public life building a reputation as a consensus-minded moderate eager to negotiate with his “friends across the aisle”. In the Democratic primary, he was cast as the establishment alternative in a field of rising stars and progressive challengers. But since emerging as the party’s standard bearer, Biden has steadily embraced a more expansive vision, arguing that the social and economic moment demands bold action. During his first press conference last month, Biden said repeatedly he wanted to “change the paradigm” – a stark shift in tone from the early days of his presidential campaign, when he promised donors that under his leadership “nothing would fundamentally change”. Congressman Jim Clyburn, the Democratic majority whip and a close ally and friend of the president, said Biden’s tenure has so far “exceeded my expectations – not my hopes and my dreams – but my expectations.” Clyburn, who is widely credited with saving Biden’s campaign by endorsing him before the South Carolina primary, said he was pleasantly surprised by Biden’s infrastructure proposal, which he “didn’t expect to be as bold as it is”. “A lot of people, I among them, felt that because of this 50-50 split in the Senate, he would go less bold,” Clyburn said. “But I think that he has calculated, the way that I would, that in the legislative process, you never get all that you ask for … so it’s much better to get some of a big bill, then some of a little bill.” Republicans are balking at the scale and cost of Biden’s plans, as well as his proposal to pay for it by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has vowed to fight Democrats “every step of the way” on Biden’s infrastructure plan, which he has panned as a “Trojan Horse” for liberal priorities. “It won’t build back better,” he said last week. “It’ll build back never.” Democratic leaders have yet to choose a legislative path forward for Biden’s infrastructure plan, but, thanks to a recent ruling by the Senate parliamentarian, they now have multiple avenues to circumvent Republican opposition. Biden’s infrastructure plan has not sat well with moderate Republicans, who say they were expecting a governing partner in the White House. “A Senate evenly split between both parties and a bare Democratic House majority are hardly a mandate to ‘go it alone’,” Mitt Romney, a Republican senator from Utah who is part of a working group that hopes to find a bipartisan solution on infrastructure, wrote recently on Twitter. The group unveiled a counterproposal that is a fraction of the size of Biden’s public works plan, touting it as a “very generous offer”. The White House welcomed the effort but the vast spending gap suggested the differences between the parties may be too wide to overcome. The president is keenly aware of the difficult math in the Senate, having spent more than 30 years in the chamber. Even if bipartisan discussions collapse and Democrats go it alone, Biden will still face challenges keeping his ungainly coalition together. But in choosing bold action over incrementalism, Biden is gambling that voters will forgive the price tag if Democrats can deliver tangible results like universal broadband and affordable childcare while seeking to put Republicans on the defensive over their opposition to a plan that polling suggests is broadly popular. A recent New York Times survey found that two in three Americans, including seven in 10 independents, approve of Biden’s infrastructure spending. Progressives are pressing the 78-year-old president to act urgently, knowing Democrats’ precarious hold on Congress is only guaranteed through January 2022. Declaring the “era of small government” over, they argue that there is a political risk to being too cautious. Pursuing an expansive economic agenda, they say, is not only good policy but good politics. Biden, for the most part, appears to agree. He has argued that spending too little confronting the nation’s crises is riskier than spending too much. He told Republicans at a meeting last week that he was open to compromise, but vowed that “inaction is not an option”. In a recent speech, Biden said it was time to retire the theory of “trickle down” economics, saying now was the time for building an economy that “grows from the bottom up and the middle out”. “This is the first time we’ve been able, since the Johnson administration and maybe even before that, to begin to change the paradigm,” the president said. Shortly after the former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd last week, Biden placed an emotional call. Huddled in the courthouse, Floyd’s family put the president on speakerphone. “At least, God, now there is some justice,” Biden told them. “We’re all so relieved.” Their attorney, Ben Crump, urged the president to pressure Congress to pass policing reform and to use this moment to confront America’s violent legacy of racism. “You got it, pal,” Biden said. “This gives us a shot to deal with genuine, systemic racism.” The murder of Floyd, who was Black, at the hands of a white police officer touched off global protests against police brutality and systemic racism. Biden said then that the long-overdue racial reckoning created a once-in-a-generation opportunity to directly address historic racial injustices. As president, Biden has placed emphasis on racial equity, drawing support from civil rights activists and criticism from conservatives. He assembled a cabinet that is the most diverse in history, including the first female, first African American and first Asian American vice-president, as well as the first Native American and first openly gay cabinet secretaries, the first female treasury secretary, the first African American defense secretary and the first immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Confronting systemic racism is the “responsibility of the whole of our government”, the White House declared, laying out steps the new administration would take to address inequality in housing, education, criminal justice, healthcare and the economy. He has emphasized equity in vaccine distribution and targeted underserved communities with his $1.9tn relief plan. His infrastructure plan dedicates funding to neighborhoods harmed by pollution and environmental hazards as well as to homecare aides, predominantly women of color. He endorsed statehood for the District of Columbia, a heavily Black city that does not have voting representation in Congress. He warned that some states were “backsliding into the days of Jim Crow” by imposing new voting restrictions. Yet a major voting rights bill remains stalled along with a long-promised policing overhaul. Biden’s sweeping immigration reform has yet to gain traction as Republicans hammer the administration over an influx of migrant children at the Mexico border. Spasms of gun violence have renewed calls for gun control. Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign leader began with the Japanese prime pinister, Yoshihide Suga, extending his condolences for a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, which left eight people dead. Suga also condemned a rising tide of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders since the start of coronavirus lockdowns. The summit underscored Biden’s belief that the nation’s crises are not only an inflection point for America – but for the world. Biden has framed his domestic revitalization effort as part of a global conflict between authoritarianism and democracy. “That’s what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about,” Biden said in his infrastructure speech. “It’s a basic question: can democracies still deliver for their people?” Jonathan Alter, author of The Defining Moment: FDR’s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope, said Biden, like the 32nd president, has a rare opportunity to transform the political landscape for generations. “Roosevelt and his New Deal represented a new social contract between the government and the people in terms of what the government owed Americans,” he said. That lasted for nearly five decades, he said, until Ronald Reagan gave rise to a new era of small-government and free-market competition. Whether Biden can forge a new social contract to meet the most urgent challenges of the 21st century – yawning inequality, a warming climate and rising authoritarianism – is a question unlikely to be answered by his 100th day in office, Alter cautioned. But he expects the next 100 to be revealing. “It’s hard to imagine but Biden has already spent several times as much in 1933-dollars as Roosevelt did in his first 100 days,” Alter said. “And the odds that a Rooseveltian achievement in American political life will take place this year are highly likely.”",2021-04-26 02:00:28,Biden’s 100 days: bold action and broad vision amid grief and turmoil,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

There have been at least 50 mass shootings in America since the massacre and apparent hate crime attack against Asian Americans in the Atlanta area on March 16. The COVID-19 pandemic has done nothing to stop America's addiction to gun violence. Writing at the Nation, Tom Engelhardt explains, ""In the first 73 days of Joe Biden's presidency, there were five mass shootings and more than 10,000 gun-violence deaths. In the Covid-19 era, this has been the model the world's 'most exceptional' nation (as American politicians of both parties used to love to call this country) has set for the rest of the planet. Put another way, so far in 2020 and 2021, there have been two pandemics in America, Covid-19 and guns."" Too many Americans love guns even more than money. It is estimated that gun violence costs the United States at least $150 billion a year. In response to discussions about an assault weapons ban after the mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News' Chris Wallace, ""If there's a natural disaster in South Carolina where the cops can't protect my neighborhood, my house will be the last ones that the gangs will come to, because I can defend myself."" The next day, Graham circulated a video of himself shooting an AR-15 assault rifle at a South Carolina gun range. For many progressives, liberals and other Americans who are not part of the MAGAverse, TrumpWorld or America's gun culture, Graham's performance of gun-toting hyper masculinity was laughable. His comments about defending his family from ""gangs"" were also criticized as being especially ill-timed given the recent mass shooting events. But again, as is so many other instances, those outside of the right-wing echo chamber were not the audience for Graham's performance. The South Carolina senator was speaking to a right-wing culture, moral universe and imaginary where guns, whiteness and toxic masculinity are tightly if not immutably linked together. He was channeling the idea of the white American male as defender of his home and family — and of heterosexual white (right-wing) male power and privilege — against some type of ""criminal"" or ""invader,"" generally understood to be black or brown. This enemy to be defended against may be a ""Muslim terrorist,"" an ""urban"" black male or a ""Latino gangbanger."" He may also be a member of ""antifa,"" the right wing's current bogeyman. Lindsey Graham's assault rifle and others like it are also central to end-times survivalist dystopian fantasies of societal breakdown and failed government that involve ""race war,"" environmental collapse, another pandemic or other such disaster. In years gone by, the enemy was the ""Indian"" attacking white settlers in the Old West. Of course, America's imperial Manifest Destiny project viewed white-settler colonialism as a noble ""civilizing"" project, in which the gun was an indispensable tool for killing the Other and maintaining control over black human property and other ""subject races."" Evoking the mythos of the Revolutionary War, the MAGAverse and TrumpWorld (and ammosexuals and gun fetishists more generally) also consider Lindsey Graham's AR-15 as his ""musket"" or ""freedom rifle."" As signified in an oft-discussed advertisement for a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle, such weapons supposedly offer their owners a chance to get their ""Man Card,"" which evidently confer godlike power over life and death, and with it enhanced libidinal drives and allure. The totemic power of such assault-style weapons also enhances their ""rights"" as (white) men and by implication control over ""their"" women and families, and society at large. New research from University of Illinois-Chicago political scientists Alexandra Filindra, Beyza Buyuker and Noah J. Kaplan offers insights into these connections between gun ownership, white masculinity, racism and patriotism. In an essay for the Washington Post, they elaborate: With two mass shootings in one week, in Georgia and Colorado, the United States is again discussing how to prevent gun violence. Within hours of the Boulder shooting, President Biden urged Congress to enact a ban on assault-style weapons. Recent history suggests that no such law will materialize. Studies find that gun rights supporters are highly politically organized and unwavering on their views, while gun regulation supporters are not. Our research found a reason for this difference: racial differences in rates of gun ownership and beliefs about guns. White Americans are far more likely than any other group to own firearms and oppose gun regulations. To them, guns are potent political symbols. For many people, especially White Americans, guns are integral to who they are as citizens and what it means to be a good citizen. These scholars' new research points to further conclusions: Our data also show that Whites, and especially White men, are the demographic group most likely to associate gun ownership with good citizenship. Specifically, our 2015 nationally representative survey of 1,900 Americans, conducted by YouGov, found that 43 percent of Whites but only 23 percent of African Americans view owning a gun as a sign of good citizenship. That gap persists when we compare White and Black men and even White and Black men who live in gun-owning households. … Whites with anti-Black attitudes are the most likely to believe that a good citizen owns a gun, and that owning a gun makes you a good citizen. That's true even when we account for other important factors, such as a person's partisan identification, ideology and whether they worry about crime. Specifically, we find that Whites who think that Black people are violent are 38 percent more likely to believe that gun ownership is a sign of good citizenship than those who do not view Blacks as violent. Similarly, Whites who think that Blacks have too much political influence are 32 percent more likely to believe good citizenship and gun ownership go together than Whites who do not. These attitudes are broadly shared among White racial conservatives, even those who do not own firearms. These findings complement other research showing the connection between gun ownership and death anxiety where the gun is understood, on a subconscious level, to confer some form of immortality. Filindra, Buyuker and Kaplan's findings also support other research showing the connections between gun ownership, support for ""stand your ground"" and concealed-carry laws and racial hostility towards black people. A majority of Americans — including many gun owners and even NRA members — support commonsense gun laws such as mandatory waiting periods for buying handguns, limiting access to certain types of weapons and ammunition, improving background checks and closing the ""gun show loophole."" President Biden has repeatedly expressed his support for such initiatives. Unfortunately, these rational and reasonable approaches to gun violence as a public health problem will do little if anything to heal or fix the way many Americans — especially white men — understand guns as a key part of their core identity and fundamental personhood. As Jonathan Metzl shows in his book ""Dying of Whiteness"", many white men in America are literally willing to die (and kill) for their guns. America's gun violence crisis is a public policy problem. But resolving that problem involves overcoming the way that powerful, moneyed interests such as the gun industry and the NRA can manipulate the spiritual emptiness and emotional insecurities felt by many gun owners. Ultimately, America is sick with gun fever, and will remain so, because too many Americans want it that way. Chauncey DeVega is a politics staff writer for Salon.

Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.

The court announced they will review a lower-court ruling that upheld New York's restrictive gun permit law after turning down a review of the case last June before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. New York is one of eight states -- including, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- that limits the right to carry a weapon in public. Shares of Sturm, Ruger were down slightly to $69.11 while Smith & Wesson fell 1.2% to $17.57 Monday. Gun sales have been in the spotlight recently following a spate of mass shootings and amid positive momentum for Second Amendment reforms from the Democratic-controlled Congress and White House. Last month, President Joe Biden called on the Senate to ""immediately pass the two House-passed bills that closed loopholes in the background-check system."" Biden's remarks came less than 24 hours after a 21-year old gunman killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a Boulder, Colo., supermarket in what police described as a random attack. The Gun Violence Archive says 160 mass shootings have been committed so far in 2021. The archive defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are shot or killed.",2021-04-26 12:17:10,Gun Stocks Move as Supreme Court Takes Up Second Amendment Case,,21619,http://www.thestreet.com
62,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/compare-gun-violence-2021-n1265201," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News It may feel like America entered a new wave of gun violence in 2021, but a review of shootings with multiple victims shows that their frequency has been unusually high for more than a year. Data from the Gun Violence Archive shows that the number of multiple-victim shootings first spiked in April 2020 and has stayed high since. The most recent wave of shootings around the country, including the April 15 attack in Indianapolis where eight people were killed at a FedEx facility, is just the latest symptom of that trend. The deadly pattern has continued this year. There have been 160 shootings from Jan. 1 to April 26 in which four or more people were injured or killed, compared to just over 90 during the same period in 2020. And this year’s total is nearly double the average for the same time period for every year since 2014. There is no federal definition of a mass shooting. The Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group based in Washington, defines it as a shooting incident in which four or more people are injured or killed, excluding the shooter. But experts say the focus on high-profile mass shootings, in which a shooter opens fire in a crowded public space, has obscured the rise in lower-profile incidents of gun violence, such as interpersonal disputes or domestic violence incidents. “If we're talking about mass shootings, those tend to be left out because they're seen as private events,” said Lisa Geller, state affairs manager at the nonprofit Coalition to Stop Gun Violence in Washington. “Some of these high-lethality events are inherently random, but if you include some of the events in private spaces, the role of domestic violence in mass shootings is large.” The rise in shootings corresponds with an increase in gun sales, which jumped at the outset of the pandemic as stay-at-home orders unleashed a wave of unemployment across the country. FBI background checks, which are conducted when a person attempts to buy a firearm from most dealers, can serve as a proxy for gun sales. In the 13 months since March 2020, the agency has seen 3 million background checks in a month 11 times, after having just one such month between 1998 and February 2020. Lacey Wallace, associate professor of criminal justice at Penn State University Altoona, said that while gun sale increases in previous years were related to personal safety fears or tighter gun laws, the current spike is related to worries unique to the pandemic. “The gun-purchasing spikes we've seen in the past year are different,” Wallace said. “This time instead of it being driven by more restrictive policies, it’s more Covid-specific things: uncertainty about the future, fear of people from foreign countries, fear of the economy tanking.” The jump in gun sales alarms gun safety advocates. The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence warned in April 2020 that guns in the home posed a risk of rises in domestic violence and gun suicides. “2020 saw record gun sales,” Geller said. “We know that when there are more guns, there is more gun violence.” There are many possible reasons for the rise in shootings over the last year, experts say, from the stress of the physical health and financial challenges of the pandemic to harder-to-access mental health services. “I think we are very aware that food insecurity, isolation and lack of social services are risk factors for many forms of gun violence,” Geller said. ""It really underscores the need for social services, for grassroots violence prevention and intervention,"" said Ari Davis, the coalition's senior policy analyst. ""Some of that was not possible during the pandemic."" Despite the overall increase in gun violence, experts agree there was a slight pause last year in high-profile, public-place mass shootings. Such pauses wouldn't be reflected in the Gun Violence Archive data, which doesn't distinguish domestic and gang shootings from more public incidents. Geller attributed the pause to stay-at-home orders, which kept people out of public places: “You couldn't have a school shooting if a school was closed.” But that pause could be over as the pandemic begins to recede, said Jeffrey Simon, a visiting political science lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said the return of crowds are creating so-called soft-targets: low-security public gatherings that are susceptible to mass shootings. “Last year there were fewer opportunities for people to target places,” Simon said. “Now with things opening up, there are more targets.” CORRECTION (April 26, 2021, 3:00 p.m.): A previous version of this article misattributed a quote about domestic violence shootings being seen as private events. It was said by Lisa Geller, the state affairs manager of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, not Ari Davis, a senior policy analyst at the coalition.

63,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7eavv/gun-owners-are-freaking-out-on-tiktok-over-the-great-ammo-shortage-of-2021,"If you don’t own guns or particularly care about guns, you probably had no idea that the United States is currently in the throes of the Great Ammunition Shortage of 2021. But in the gun world, it’s all anyone can talk about. There’s an entire subreddit dedicated to flagging locations that have recently restocked their ammo supplies. Gun owners have flocked to remote sporting goods stores in pursuit of ammo, only to find dozens of other hopeful customers lining up outside. And the #ammoshortage hashtag on TikTok is full of people gazing solemnly at barren ammunition sections, or bragging about their impressive stockpiles of ammunition—or offering creative workarounds to the shortage, like running over bobcats with their cars instead of shooting them, and strangling wild turkeys, since you can’t, you know, shoot them. A perfect storm of factors led to the national ammo drought, which is forecast to drag out for at least another year. Americans began buying guns at a record pace in 2020 after COVID-19 hit the U.S. Between March and September 2020, gun sales jumped by 91 percent over the same period the previous year. And the approximately 15.1 million new guns needed ammo. But there were manufacturing issues. International shipments of materials used in ammunition were delayed amid restrictions. Ammo and firearm manufacturers were required to temporarily halt operations in certain states where they weren’t deemed essential business. All the while, demand kept climbing. National unrest after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis cop (and conspiracy theories about that unrest coming into the suburbs) created another run on guns and ammo. And when Joe Biden won the presidential election and vowed to pursue gun control, demand surged again. “People have purchased firearms at a record number over the last year. And in addition to that, we’ve not gotten resupplied on firearms. And we also haven’t gotten resupplied on ammunition,” said John Taylor, manager of Elite Firearms, a gun store in Las Vegas. “And these people who purchased firearms took them out, fired them— and then found out that they used up all their ammo.” Taylor said he began noticing an uptick in demand for guns in early 2020. “At the beginning of the pandemic, when we saw China dragging families from their homes—when those news clips hit the U.S., it started a panic,” said Taylor, referring to viral videos  showing people in hazmat suits taking residents from their homes in the city of Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, to quarantine or isolate. “And then when we had the toilet paper shortage, that added to the panic.” And because ammunition is scarce, it’s also more expensive. Before the shortage, a box of 9mm rounds might have gone for about $9.99. Now, you’re looking at upwards of $35 for a box of 50 9mm rounds. Taylor said  some people are profiteering off of the shortage by jacking their prices way up: “I have an associate who just purchased 1,000 rounds of 9mm, and it cost him $700.” The situation doesn’t seem likely to be resolved anytime soon. Taylor said  his store has been advised that manufacturers won’t be making regular ammunition deliveries for a year. “They are so backlogged,” Taylor said. He said that at first, customers were “pretty upset” about not being able to obtain ammunition. “Now it’s more like, ‘OK I’ve called every other shop in town and you’re telling me the same thing,’” said Taylor. “It’s almost become a situation where they’ve semi accepted it.” For Garrison Burge, who manages Beech Grove Firearms, a gun store just outside Indianapolis, he’s dealing with another spike in demand after the recent mass shooting at a FedEx facility nearby. “Any time there’s a national tragedy that happens, or any type of shooting, there’s a lot of gun owners wanting to purchase firearms, which leads to them needing ammunition,” Burge told VICE News. “Because of those incidents, there’s been a large demand in ammo. But unfortunately, the amount of materials are not there to push out the quantity that’s needed.” (FBI data showed that background checks soared the week of March 15-21 after the deadly shooting rampage at massage parlors near Atlanta, making it the highest week on record since 1998.) Eugene, a 31-year-old from the D.C. area, who declined to share his last name, said he began to notice ammo prices creeping up last summer. “It became a game of hunting for ‘regular’-price ammo and snagging it before it went out of stock,” he said. At first he was buying online, but the online stores with reasonable prices were selling out fast. “I did switch to looking in physical stores,” Eugene said. He recalled going into a large sporting goods store in July and seeing the shooting section completely bare other than hunting guns. “No Glocks, no AR-15s, no Mossberg shotguns or pistol-caliber carbines, nothing,” said Eugene. “The shelves where the ammo should be were also totally bare. I said to my buddy at the time that it genuinely felt like the first 10 minutes of a disaster movie. We couldn't believe how empty it was.” Eugene said he returned to the same store out of curiosity a few months later and got to chatting with a couple guys who were waiting around in the store. “I pretty quickly found out that a truck had just arrived that might have ammo on it,” Eugene said. “That rumor spread so quickly that by the time they brought the ammo out to sell to us 20 minutes later, our group of three or four had turned into 50. They had to organize us in a line like it was Black Friday.” Long, snaking lines near gun stores rumored to have fresh supplies of ammo have become a regular occurrence. Other gun-related industries have also had to make adjustments in light of the shortage. For example, the niche sport of “cowboy action shooting,” which aims to preserve the traditions of the Old West by competing with guns like single-action revolvers, old-time shotguns, and pistol-caliber lever action rifles. Competitors are required to wear costumes and adopt aliases that would not be out of place in an old Western movie. “The shortage is something that affects our sport quite a bit actually,” said Corina Novo, aka “Ruby Ruthless,” who works as an administrator for the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS). The biggest issue they’ve been having is getting their hands on the standard size of primers, a critical but little-understood component to ammunition. As a result of the shortage, some local competitions have switched over to .22-caliber, which is typically reserved for junior shooters because it’s a lot easier. The ammunition shortage has also posed a bit of an obstacle for militia organizing. VICE News spoke with Reddit user Tactischink, 21, about his efforts to form a militia in his home state of Minnesota. He says that even if some of his friends were open to the idea of forming a militia, the cost of doing so was prohibitive. “They’re like, OK, that does sound kind of badass, but it’s a lot of money,” Tactischink said. “There’s a huge ammo shortage, so ammo is very, very expensive. I mean, we’re talking a dollar a round. If you want to buy a thousand rounds, you’re looking at a thousand dollars, which is a ton of money for people that are younger like myself.” A day at the range might end up using about 800 rounds. “It’s a very expensive sport to get into,” he added. The ammunition shortage is also being felt within some local police departments, who say that the steep price is cutting into their budgets allocated for training officers. “Each officer is probably shooting anywhere from 100 rounds to 200 rounds each, so it adds up quite a bit,” Sheriff Brian McLean from Houghton County, Michigan, told Michigan Live earlier this month. With no end in sight to the Great Ammo Shortage of 2021, at least there’s a bunch of creative workarounds on TikTok. Follow Tess Owen on Twitter.

64,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/04/supreme-court-second-amendment-concealed-carry.html?via=rss,"On Monday morning, the Supreme Court took a step that gun rights advocates have been awaiting for more than a decade: It took up a challenge to restrictions on Americans’ rights to carry concealed firearms in public. There is little doubt that the court’s 6–3 conservative majority will use this case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Corlett, to knock down limits on concealed carry, creating a fundamental right to bear arms outside the home. The stakes are high: laws guaranteeing a right to concealed carry are associated with a significantly higher rate of handgun-related homicide. And the court’s move gives Democrats a clear choice between two concrete options: Stand by as the conservative justices invalidate state and local gun regulations in the midst of endless mass shootings—or expand the court. New York is one of seven states that requires gun owners to show good cause to obtain a concealed carry permit. About 83 million people, or about one in every four Americans, live in these states. (Two additional states, Connecticut and Rhode Island, also give officials discretion to limit concealed carry.) The “good cause” standard gives state authorities broad discretion to deny the permit unless the applicant has demonstrated that, for instance, they have heightened reasons to fear for their safety in public. A federal circuit court upheld New York’s rule under the Second Amendment in 2020—a reasonable decision, since the Supreme Court has never actually found a right to transport guns outside the home. Rather, in 2008’s D.C. v. Heller and 2010’s McDonald v. Chicago, the court established a right to keep a handgun “in the home” for self-defense. In light of this language, five circuit courts have found no right to concealed carry, while two circuit courts have found such a right under the Second Amendment. Ever since McDonald in 2010, firearm advocates have sought to persuade the Supreme Court to take up a case that would resolve this dispute. That quest has proved elusive. For many years, SCOTUS simply turned away Second Amendment cases, sometimes over the dissents of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The court likely swatted down these appeals because Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, was uncomfortable with a broad right to bear arms. After Justice Brett Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy, SCOTUS agreed to hear a challenge to New York City’s strict limit on the transportation of guns to firing ranges and vacation homes. But the city repealed its law, so the court tossed out the dispute. Presumably disappointed by the missed opportunity, Kavanaugh wrote separately to indicate that he would gladly strengthen the Second Amendment in a future case. That case has now arrived, and its outcome is not difficult to predict. Not only has Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy, but Justice Amy Coney Barrett has replaced Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was not an ally of gun rights. On the lower court, Barrett authored a lengthy dissent arguing that the Second Amendment prohibits the government from imposing a permanent, categorical ban on gun possession by people convicted of felonies. Her opinion, an instant favorite among firearm enthusiasts, claimed that the original meaning of the Second Amendment did not allow for “virtue-based restrictions” to bear arms; felons may be stripped of “civic rights” like voting, Barrett wrote, but not “individual rights like the right to possess a gun.” This conclusion was surprising because the Supreme Court explicitly addressed this question in Heller: Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion offered a list of “presumptively lawful” restrictions on the Second Amendment, including “longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons.” But it was Kennedy who urged Scalia to insert this qualifying language into his opinion. With Kennedy off the court, Barrett appeared eager to see the court do away with the limits that he demanded in Heller. There can be no real doubt that, as a justice, she will side with her fellow conservatives in extending Heller to take the right to bear arms out of the home, where Kennedy had confined it, and into the public sphere. Such a decision would not alter laws in most states, where legislatures have already granted residents a right to concealed carry. But it would revolutionize gun laws in several populous states—including California, the nation’s largest state, which strictly limits concealed carry to residents who can show “good cause.” The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld California’s law in 2016. And just last month, the 9th Circuit found no constitutional right to public carry whatsoever. In a 127-page opinion, Judge Jay Bybee, a conservative George W. Bush nominee, canvassed the history of gun rights, surveying the English Bill of Rights (a predecessor of the Second Amendment), practice in the American colonies, the revolutionary era, and the founding, as well as state and territorial laws throughout the 19th century. Bybee concluded that, as a matter of original public meaning, the Constitution does not guarantee a right to bear arms outside the home. It will not matter to this Supreme Court. A growing body of historical research has demonstrated that Scalia’s opinion in Heller is just plain wrong as a matter of originalism: The words of the Second Amendment, as accepted at the time of its ratification, were not understood to create an individual right to bear arms. Scalia’s opinion was an example of living or “popular constitutionalism,” transfiguring modern demands into ancient rights. Yet the Supreme Court’s conservatives have shown no interest in reconsidering Heller; to the contrary, they are now on the brink of extending it. When originalism clashes with the conservative legal movement’s agenda, it is easy to guess which will win out. In 2021 so far, there has already been more than one mass shooting each day. The United States is transforming into a battlefield, where no one can go to a store, a park, or a school without the fear that they might be shot to death. Further, American gun culture has contributed to hair-trigger policing that results in a vastly disproportionate number of police killings of civilians when compared to peer nations, a crisis which has fallen particularly hard on Black Americans. At least the justices have made Democrats’ options starker than ever. Congress and the White House can prioritize court expansion, adding liberal justices to prevent the current 6–3 majority from eradicating gun safety laws. Or they can watch as the majority exacerbates the nation’s epidemic of gun violence by imposing a vision of the Second Amendment that data has indicated leads to more handgun-related homicides. The choice has never been so clear. And the stakes can be measured in human lives. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2021 The Slate Group LLC.

65,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/04/26/red-flag-gun-laws-boulder-indianapolis-shootings/,"Trending: By Christie Aschwanden, Kaiser Health News On New Year’s Eve 2017, sheriff’s deputies in the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch responded to a domestic disturbance. Before the night was over, four officers had been shot and Douglas County Sheriff’s Deputy Zackari Parrish III was dead. The gunman was a 37-year-old man with a history of psychotic episodes whose family had previously tried to take his guns away but found themselves without legal recourse to do so. “We tried every legal avenue we could to not only protect him, but to protect the community,” said Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock. At that time, however, there was nothing more they could do. That changed with the passage of the Deputy Zackari Parrish III Violence Prevention Act, a “red flag” law that took effect in January 2020. It gives judges the ability to issue “extreme risk protection orders” allowing law enforcement to seize firearms from people deemed dangerous to themselves or others. Colorado is among the most recent of 19 states to have enacted red flag laws. Connecticut was first, in 1999. Since then, the data has been mixed on whether the laws have prevented suicides and inconclusive on their power to curb mass shootings. The Connecticut law did not prevent the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, for instance, though proponents usually point to the laws as one tool for preventing shootings, not one that’s 100% effective. But law enforcement officials who support the laws say they have clearly saved lives. A study published in 2019 looked at 21 cases in California in which extreme risk protection orders were granted from 2016 to 2018, and found that as of August 2019 none of the subjects of these orders had committed a murder or suicide, though it’s impossible to prove the orders prevented such outcomes. The red flag law hadn’t been invoked in Colorado, the site of some of the nation’s most infamous mass shootings, in connection with the suspect accused of killing 10 people in a Boulder grocery store in March. In Indiana, where a former FedEx employee shot and killed eight people at an Indianapolis facility before killing himself in April, prosecutors did not seek a court hearing under that state’s red flag law last year after the suspect’s mother reported to police that her son was suicidal. Mass shootings may grab the most attention, but they are too rare to measure whether red flag laws help prevent them, said Rosanna Smart, an economist who studies gun violence at the Rand Corp. The suspect arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder in the Boulder shooting had a history of violent outbursts dating back three years or longer, so it is hard to assess, while facts of the case are still being gathered, whether the red flag law could have been applied to him. In 2018 the man pleaded guilty to third-degree assault after punching a fellow student at his suburban Denver high school in an attack the victim called unprovoked. He also was kicked off the school’s wrestling team after making threats of violence. Police seized a shotgun from the Indianapolis shooting suspect after his mother reported in 2020 that she was worried her son, then 18, was considering “suicide by cop,” or deliberately provoking a lethal response by officers. An Indiana prosecutor told The Associated Press that authorities did not seek a hearing under the red flag law because they worried they would have to return the shotgun to him if they lost in court. Most gun deaths in the U.S. are suicides, and Smart said about two-thirds of red flag cases regard somebody as at risk for self-harm. Last April, Smart and her colleagues published a review of research on the effects of red flag laws and found ”very inconclusive” evidence that they’re effective as a means to reduce overall firearm suicide or homicide rates. “I wouldn’t say it’s strongly one way or another,” Smart said. Research by Aaron Kivisto, a psychologist at the University of Indianapolis, used a method called “synthetic control” to calculate that 10 years after the enactment of Indiana’s 2005 red flag law there was a 7.5% reduction in suicides compared with what would have been expected without the law, and the drop was driven exclusively by reductions in firearm suicides. In Connecticut, the results were more of a “mixed bag,” Kivisto said. Initially, the effect was “negligible,” but the Connecticut law wasn’t used much until after the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, in which a student killed 32 people and wounded 17. After that shooting, seizures in Connecticut rose fivefold and Kivisto’s group did then see a reduction in firearm suicides in the state, but they also found that those reductions were largely offset by increases in non-gun suicides. Still, taking all the studies together, Kivisto said, “The biggest takeaway is that the evidence supporting red flag laws as one means of reducing suicide appears to be consistently supported.” Colorado’s suicide rates are among the highest in the nation, but it’s too soon to know yet whether the state’s red flag law has made a difference, especially given how unusual 2020 was in so many other ways. From Jan. 1, 2020, to March 26, 2021, Colorado tallied 141 red flag cases. Extreme risk orders were granted under the law in 28 of the state’s 64 counties, including some of the more than 35 counties whose sheriffs or county leaders opposed the law and declared themselves “Second Amendment sanctuaries,” where the law would not be enforced, said state Rep. Tom Sullivan, a Democrat. Sullivan, one of the bill’s sponsors, has been a gun control advocate since his 27-year-old son, Alex, was among the 12 killed by a gunman in the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting. Where the red flag law has been used in Colorado, “it’s clearly saved those individuals’ lives. Those people are still alive, and their family members are still alive, and they’re not in custody for homicide,” Douglas County Sheriff Spurlock said. “I do think it keeps my officers safer, and it keeps our community safer.” But the law still has numerous opponents. Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams counters that situations like the one last fall in which an extreme risk protection order was approved for a 28-year-old man making plans to assassinate state Attorney General Phil Weiser should be dealt with using criminal charges, rather than a red flag law. “Red flag, to me, doesn’t look like a primary way of dealing with a potentially criminal situation,” said Reams, who called Sheriff Spurlock a good friend with whom he’s repeatedly debated the issue. As for people at risk of self-harm, Reams said he’d rather have better ways to get them mental health treatment than take their guns away. Opponents of red flag laws say they’re unconstitutional, but a challenge to Colorado’s law on constitutional grounds filed by the group Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and several Republican lawmakers was dismissed by a state District Court judge in Denver last spring. Some opposition to Colorado’s law focuses on the execution, rather than the intent. Dave Kopel, an adjunct law professor at the University of Denver and an analyst with the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, has testified in favor of red flag laws in the Colorado legislature but is critical of the current law for what he says are weaknesses in due process. “The accuser never has to appear in court or be cross-examined,” he said, and that means the judge may hear only one side of the case. “My view, as a constitutional law professor, is that you should write the law with strong due process protections at the start.” But Spurlock, a Republican, said there is more due process in implementing Colorado’s red flag law than there is in police obtaining a search warrant. He said he supports gun rights but does not support allowing possession by felons or people who are a danger to themselves or others. “That’s why I supported the red flag. And I will continue to do so. I know for a fact that it saves lives, and it’s not harming anyone,” he said. Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

From Scheer Post If you're looking for proof the CIA and the whole cavalcade of other intelligence agencies working with them have gotten too big, look no further than the DNI's latest report The CIA(Image by Truthout.org from flickr)   Details   DMCA December 22, 1963 -- exactly one month after President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated, former President Harry S. Truman published an op-ed in the Washington Post that most people, especially our perfumed ruling elite, wanted to ignore. Truman, who signed the CIA into existence just after World War II, wrote, ""I think it has become necessary to take another look at the purpose and operations of our Central Intelligence Agency -- the CIA. [""] For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas. ""There is something about the way the CIA has been functioning that is casting a shadow over our historic position and I feel that we need to correct it."" Not only did that adorn the pages of the Washington Post one month after JFK's death, Truman hand wrote the first draft just one week after JFK met up with a bunch of bullets in Dallas. Sure, one may wish Harry had sent his thoughts to John a month before the President's televised execution. Maybe he could've sent a singing telegram or something. But let's at least give Truman partial credit for the belated message. Before his death President Kennedy also held no love for the Central Intelligence Agency. Following the calamitous Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy said he wanted to ""splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds."" Point being, clearly Truman, who created the CIA, and Kennedy, who met a mysterious untimely end by professional killers, knew the agency had run amok. Yet the CIA is still here, bigger and filled with more Bond villains than ever, and now they have a whole cavalcade of other intelligence agencies working with them. The Intelligence Community just recently put out a report that showed that their component agencies are indeed working to surveil, harass, and attack an assortment of U.S. citizens. This particular report from the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines was written in consultation with the CIA, the FBI, the DIA, the DHS, and a partridge in a pear tree. (An evil, kinda dastardly partridge. Not a good partridge at all. Like the kind of partridge that would eat the last pickle and then put the jar back in the fridge, so that later when you're excited to grab a delicious crispy pickle, there's nothin' there but a jar full of pickle urine. So yeah, the worst partridge.) The new report stated, ""The Intelligence Community assesses that domestic violent extremists who are motivated by a range of ideologies and galvanized by recent political and societal events in the U.S. pose an elevated threat to the Homeland in 2021."" Journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote of the report, ""It makes clear that its target encompasses a wide range of groups from the left (Antifa, animal rights and environmental activists, pro-choice extremists and anarchists: those who oppose capitalism and all forms of globalization) to those on the right (sovereign citizen movements, anti-abortion activists and those deemed motivated by racial or ethnic hatreds)."" Leave it to our stellar Intelligence Community to group together animal rights activists  who have killed essentially no one ever  with racial-hatred extremists  the perpetrators of just about every mass shooting or American terror attack this century. Such a comparison is like saying the 15-year-old who puts a thumb tack on his teacher's chair is the same as a U.S. military drone aircraft in that they're both trying to cause harm. Ummm, I think one may cause slightly more harm than the other. And freeing animals isn't harm to begin with. What kind of person sees someone release a cow and yells, ""Whoa! That's  just like a bomb going off in an elementary school!"" On top of that, the CIA and their wannabes are surveilling and grouping alongside domestic terrorists anyone who points out capitalism causes a lot of problems. Such an analysis is just, well, fact. Capitalism is an economic system requiring infinite growth on a planet with finite resources  so at the end of the day, it can only result in epic collapse. That's not an opinion. That's just how it is. (Sidenote: It would be totally cool, FBI, if you could stop watching me through my iPhone camera. ""How about at least not when I'm on the toilet? ... Please?) Greenwald said, ""To the Department of Homeland Security, an 'extremist' is anyone who opposes the current prevailing ruling class and system for distributing power. Anyone they believe is prepared to use violence, intimidation or coercion in pursuit of these causes then becomes a 'domestic violent extremist,' subject to a vast array of surveillance, monitoring and other forms of legal restrictions."" Coercion? Well, sh*t  I'm willing to use coercion to change our class structure! I think I almost named my TV show Coercion to Bring Down the Class Structure with Lee Camp. I guess that makes me a domestic violent extremist?! How's this for irony: you could be named a domestic violent extremist for non-violently protesting to end war. That's like being called an addict for watching too many ""Say No To Drugs"" commercials.

67,https://theslot.jezebel.com/the-conservative-supreme-court-has-picked-a-cruel-time-1846763789,"As the nation reels from an endless stream of high-profile mass shootings, the majority conservative Supreme Court decided to hear a second amendment case that could potentially make it even easier to carry a gun in public. On Monday, the Court announced they hear a New York case that challenges the state’s strict restrictions against carrying a firearm outside of the home. State law requires anyone seeking a license to carry a pistol in public to have “proper cause”; in other words, someone isn’t eligible for a license simply because they want to have a gun on them at all times, but must prove that they have a special need for such extreme levels of protection. While vague, such restrictions  curtail the number of New Yorkers walking around with handguns, as do similar laws in places like California, Maryland, Hawaii, etc. But now the Supreme Court has decided to review New York’s law, making it the first major second amendment case they’ve taken on in over a decade. From the New York Times: The Supreme Court now has a six-justice conservative majority, and its two newest members — Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — took a broad view of Second Amendment rights as appeals court judges. [...] The [Court’s] most conservative members have long decried the court’s reluctance to explore the meaning and scope of the Second Amendment. In 2017, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote that they had detected “a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.” “For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous,” Justice Thomas wrote. “But the framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense.” The cash-strapped, controversy-laden shitshow known as the National Rifle Association is ecstatic. Jason Ouimet, the Executive Director of the NRA’s lobbying body, said, “We’re confident that the Court will tell New York and the other states that our Second Amendment right to defend ourselves is fundamental, and doesn’t vanish when we leave our homes.” Ouimet also noted the significance of this development, given the fact that the Court usually turns down Second Amendment cases. But that was before the newest addition, ultra-conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the fold. The timing couldn’t be more ghoulish. The United States has seen a spike in mass shootings in 2021, averaging more than one mass shooting each day. Indianapolis is still recovering from the mass shooting at a FedEx facility on April 16, in which a gunman shot and killed eight people. Most Americans favor stricter gun control laws, but conservatives are salivating over the prospect of making their flawed fantasy a reality: More so-called “good guys” with guns, ready and willing to stop the “bad guys.” Of course, it doesn’t matter that their everyday American superhero is a myth; for some, the more guns in American hands, the better. Let’s hope that the conservatives finally go with the strict constructionism that they’re always clamoring about.  In order to have the right to bear arms, people must be in a well regulated militia.",2021-04-26 12:45:00,The Conservative Supreme Court Has Picked a Cruel Time to Hear Their First Second Amendment Case in Over a Decade,,6154,http://jezebel.com
68,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2021/04/26/second-amendment-trending-on-twitter-after-scotus-case-announced/,"WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 2: Paul Clement, former U.S. Solicitor General and attorney representing ... [+] the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association and other petitioners, speaks to the press outside the U.S. Supreme Court after oral arguments in the Second Amendment case NY State Rifle & Pistol v. City of New York, NY on December 2, 2019 in Washington, DC. Several gun owners and the NRA's New York affiliate challenged New York City laws concerning handgun ownership and and they contend the citys gun license laws are overly restrictive and potentially unconstitutional. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The terms ""Second Amendment,"" ""Gun Control"" and ""SCOTUS"" were trending throughout the day on Monday on social media after it was announced that the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) had agreed to take up a major gun rights case. In NY State Rifle & Pistol Assoc. v. Corlett, the justices will consider the extent to which the Second Amendment protects the rights to carry guns outside the home for self-defense. There were more than 10,000 tweets related to the Second Amendment, and equal numbers for gun control. A tweet from @SCOTUSblog had more than 2,500 likes and was retweeted 883 times. This will be the first major case related to gun rights that the highest court in the land will hear in more than a decade. At issue in this case is how much the Second Amendment protects the rights of individuals to carry concealed weapons outside their home for self-defense. The case is likely to be argued this fall. Few issues have divided Americans as much as the Second Amendment and calls for gun control. This was certainly apparent on Monday on the social media platforms. The court's decision to hear the case follows recent mass shootings in Indiana, Georgia, Colorado and California but also comes as there has been a surge in firearms sales, notably to first-time buyers. Multiple states allow gun owners to carry their firearms when they go out, but several states including New York – as well as California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island – have restrictions in place. The Supreme Court overturned handgun bans in Washington, D.C. and in Chicago in 2008 and 2010 in a pair of landmark cases that redefined gun rights. Multiple news outlets quickly posted to social media the decision by the court to hear the New York-based case. Greg Stohr (@GregStohr), Supreme Court reporter for Bloomberg News, wrote, ""BREAKING: Supreme Court will take up major new gun case and decide whether Second Amendment applies outside the home. Court will review New York law that requires people to show a special need for protection to get a license to carry a handgun."" Reaction From Gun Control Supporters Many supporters of gun control expressed their dismay at the news on Monday afternoon. Activist Andrea Junker (@Strandjunker) was among those who shared memes to make her point. ""The second amendment was created to killed tyrants and protect children, but instead it looks like it’s killing children and protecting tyrants... sheeezz,"" suggested @Alexandrawidit. ""There is not one child who wants to die for your second amendment right. Not one,"" wrote @mhdksafa. Gun control activist Fred Guttenberg (@fred_guttenberg), whose 14-year old daughter was killed at the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, expressed his frustration on Monday, writing, ""Because of this Supreme Court, this is the moment that I have feared. The Trump appointed justices have a track record and they are not likely to put public safety first. We need to get national legislation passed this year."" Mark Brnovich (@GeneralBrnovich), attorney general of Arizona, saw that this as a state's rights issue, writing, ""Standing up for the Second Amendment is our responsibility. Arizona is proud to be co-leading a 23-state coalition that says our rights do not end when we step out of our home."" Slate staff writer Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) offered his feelings on the matter, ""Going back to the Second Amendment case the Supreme Court granted today, Democrats now have a clear choice between two concrete options: Allow SCOTUS to knock down state and local restrictions on concealed public carry in the midst of endless mass shootings, or expand the court."" Such strong reactions should not be unexpected. ""The two issues that the GOP developed as wedge issues to divide Americans and drive the party's comeback in the 1970s were abortion and guns,"" said Matthew J. Schmidt, PhD, associate professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven. ""Republicans were in favor of the right to choose before Roe,"" Schmidt suggested. ""It’s the same with gun rights. Social media merely amplifies the ideological divide the party needed to create to stay in power. These become religious-like issues because they're framed as matters of human freedom, which amps up the extremes people are willing to go to. ""And since social media gives a sense of a lack of consequences, behavior gets even more extreme,"" added Schmidt. Second Amendment Supporters Weighed In Many supporters of the Second Amendment were equally vocal on Monday. This included Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik). She posted a series of tweets in support of the Second Amendment. Independent filmmaker and political commentator Tim Pool (@Timcast) suggested, ""I already have the right to bear arms wherever I choose. its the criminal state and the police that prevent me from doing so"" Republican Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) wrote, ""Today SCOTUS agreed to review an important Second Amendment case that asks 'whether New York's denial of applications for concealed-carry licenses for self-defense violates the Second Amendment?' The answer, of course, is YES. Next question?"" The National Rifle Association (@NRA) also was quick to take to social media, ""It is hard to overstate how important this case is. The decision will affect the laws in many states that currently restrict carrying a firearm outside of the home."" The quick response from supporters of the Second Amendment also isn't surprising. ""Gun owners are some of the most ardent defenders of their beliefs, and for good reason,"" explained Teresa Mull, editor of GunPowdermagazine.com ""For one thing, this group of people is used to standing up for themselves, as the Second Amendment is constantly under attack,"" said Mull. ""What's more, the rights the Second Amendment protects – namely, the defense of self, property, and loved ones – are personal and passion-worthy. It's vital to the Constitution and every freedom it ensures that gun owners continue to make their voices heard, despite the determination of social media giants and the mainstream media to 'cancel' freedom of speech."" A Wedge Issue The Second Amendment/Gun Control remains one of those issues that isn't likely to find any middle ground on social media. ""In many ways, the gun debate is similar to the abortion debate in that the sides can't agree on the nature of the question being debated,"" explained technology analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. ""On the gun question, one side is arguing that the Second Amendment is comprehensive and provides absolute rights similar to freedom and free speech about gun ownership and use; the other side is understandably freaking out about gun deaths and treating them as endemic and thus only treatable through draconian measures justified by the past deaths."" The issue also is one that could continue to widen the divide as both sides dig in on the social platforms. ""Neither side of this debate seems to want to be reasonable; the left wants to ban ownership of certain types of guns which wrongly focuses on the tool rather than the bad behavior,"" said Enderle. ""The right wants no limitations on gun ownership and seems more interested in gun manufacturer profits than citizen safety,"" Enderle noted. ""Neither position, in my opinion, is reasonable or sustainable."" ",2021-04-26 15:08:44,“Second Amendment” Trending On Twitter After SCOTUS Case Announced,,1104,http://www.forbes.com/

News By Jackson O'Bryan Submit April 26, 2021 | 3:49pm				| Updated April 26, 2021 | 3:49pm Gun sales in the US hit record highs for the second year in a row — following a month that saw a mass shooting nearly every week. The FBI has seen a mounting number of instant background checks, required for a licensed firearm store to sell a gun, throughout 2021, according to federal statistics. The agency processed 4 million checks in January, 3.4 million in February and 4.7 million in March this year. Those numbers are increases from last year, when 2.7 million checks were conducted in January, 2.8 million in February and 3.7 million in March. Six of the 10 days that saw the most background checks in the FBI’s history came in last month, including the highest volume in a week since 1998 — 1,218,002 checks from March 15 to 21. All of the other weeks with the record-highest number of background checks occurred in 2020 and 2021, with the exception of one week in 2012. The spike in sales follows a gruesome month of gun violence in the US, including eight people shot and killed in Atlanta-area massage parlors, 10 killed in a Boulder grocery store, four in a Southern California office complex and seven in a South Carolina home. Nine were gunned down at a Texas FedEx facility earlier this month. Many among the millions buying guns were first-timers, according to industry data. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm industry trade group, found in a 2020 survey that 40 percent of customers who came in from January to April 2020 were first-time buyers, and of those, 40 percent were women. The most commonly purchased weapon was a semiautomatic handgun, according to the NSSF. The newly acquired firearms may not be firing any time soon, though. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted ammunition manufacturing and caused a nationwide shortage forecast to continue into next year. The delays have also constrained gun inventory. Store owners told NPR they have been unable to keep enough guns in stock to meet demand. Read Next Italian man violated lockdown to meet prostitutes, blames ...

The measure would expedite the review of hate crimes at the Justice Department and provide support for local law enforcement in response to thousands of reported violent incidents in the past year. Police have seen a noted uptick in such crimes, including the February death of an 84-year-old man who was pushed to the ground near his home in San Francisco, a young family that was injured in a Texas grocery store attack last year and the killing of six Asian women in shootings last month in Atlanta. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, the legislation’s lead sponsor, said the measure is incredibly important to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, “who have often felt very invisible in our country, always seen as foreign, always seen as the other.” She said the message of the legislation is as important as its content and substance. Related: Chinese students in the US grapple with the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes This national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes — including the recent mass shooting in Atlanta — is prompting a national conversation.

71,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/26/san-jose-arrest-in-alleged-hit-and-run-homicide-apartment-shooting-still-under-investigation/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — An arrest has been made in a deadly hit-and-run from earlier this month that is now being investigated as a homicide after evidence indicated the collision was intentional, according to San Jose police. The victim of that collision, 33-year-old Ricardo Cendejas, was gravely injured April 8 in the 1100 block of South First Street, just south of downtown, and died at a local hospital April 15, according to police and the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office. But the announcement that the death was classified as a homicide did not happen until Saturday. Then on Monday, police announced that detectives arrested Amber Daphnee Chavez, a 40-year-old San Jose resident, on April 20 after a “preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect was connected to a carjacking and used the vehicle as a weapon to intentionally attack the victim.” Police have not disclosed if or how Chavez and Cendejas knew each other. His death marked the city’s 13th homicide of the year. Meanwhile, a deadly shooting Saturday in a hallway of The Grad, a student-oriented 19-story high-rise apartment building on East San Carlos Street a block west of San Jose State University, remains under investigation.

According to police, the shooting was reported at 11:37 a.m. and responding officers found a man suffering from gunshot injuries. The victim, who died at the scene, has not been formally identified by the coroner’s office as of Monday, but a campus message from San Jose State affirmed that neither the victim nor the building — which is privately owned — had direct connections to the university. Police said the shooting appeared to stem from some kind of clash in the hallway, but declined to detail the circumstances. No suspect has been arrested or publicly identified in the shooting, which marked the city’s 14th homicide of the year.

The Native Americans, I don’t even need to mention them, what happened is clear,” Erdogan said after a Monday cabinet meeting. He also suggested that the international community should “also talk about what happened to… blacks and in Vietnam.” LIVE — Erdoğan: US President Biden’s biased statement on 1915 events is destructive for Turkish-American bilateral relations. We believe that Mr. Biden’s statement was due to pressure from radical Armenian figures pic.twitter.com/JPyG0ZhtAy — DAILY SABAH (@DailySabah) April 26, 2021  The United States recognized the Armenian Genocide on Saturday. The Trump administration rejected a bipartisan resolution in 2019 that called for the State Department to do so, after Erdogan threatened to “oppose [the US] by reciprocating such decisions in parliament.” “Can we speak about America without mentioning [Native Americans]? It is a shameful moment in US history,” he said at the time. (RELATED: Chinese Official Says American Politicians Promoted Racism And Hatred That Led To Mass Shooting) The Ottoman Empire carried out the Armenian Genocide between 1915 and 1916, during which between 600,000 and 1.2 million people died, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. The Turkish government claims that Armenians were relocated within the Ottoman Empire in response to internal unrest. “Armenian gangs, who were at least 150,000 to 300,000 people, carried out massacres in Turkish territory. Furthermore, they partnered with Russian forces to fight against us. Ottoman authorities took precautions,” Erdogan said. “A week’s time was given to prepare and those with an excuse were exempted from the relocation,” he continued. Erdogan also blamed “pressure from radical Armenian figures” for the United States’ government’s stance.

It’s not just about the ban. It’s about future generations who will be subject to a lifetime of addiction. We need to do better not just for us, for the future. Sheila PhanSan Jose Reading about the ongoing attacks targeted against Asian communities is heartbreaking for a young woman who identifies as Chinese. These racial attacks arose from the belief of Asians being the cause of the pandemic. The mass shooting that killed six Asian women among the eight victims in Atlanta, Ga., and the countless elderly attacks across the nation are examples of how the Asian communities have been harassed. The rise of Anti-Asian racial incidents whether verbally or harassment can be heard with support for the AAPI community and advocating the education of the racist past Asian Americans have endured.

Many of my peers have been affected by flavored tobacco, and it has negatively impacted their lives. I strongly urge people to consider how detrimental it would be if flavored tobacco is not banned. It’s not just about the ban. It’s about future generations who will be subject to a lifetime of addiction. We need to do better not just for us, for the future. Sheila Phan
San Jose Reading about the ongoing attacks targeted against Asian communities is heartbreaking for a young woman who identifies as Chinese. These racial attacks arose from the belief of Asians being the cause of the pandemic. The mass shooting that killed six Asian women among the eight victims in Atlanta, Ga., and the countless elderly attacks across the nation are examples of how the Asian communities have been harassed. The rise of Anti-Asian racial incidents whether verbally or harassment can be heard with support for the AAPI community and advocating the education of the racist past Asian Americans have endured. It is important the Asian community gets heard and feel like we are part of the country. It is also important we have the help and resources we need to create a protective network so our Asian elders can walk freely without being worried. Joanna Tang

76,https://www.alternet.org/2021/04/expanding-supreme-court/,"Capping off a month that has already featured more than 40 mass shootings across the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a National Rifle Association-backed challenge to a New York state gun control law—triggering new calls for Democrats to urgently ""expand the court."" Slate staff writer Mark Joseph Stern, who covers courts and the law, pointed out in a series of tweets Monday that ""this case is likely to pave the way to the Supreme Court declaring a constitutional right to concealed public carry, overriding many state and local restrictions on the ability to bear concealed arms in public."" ""Congress and the White House can prioritize court expansion, adding liberal justices to prevent the current six–three majority from eradicating gun safety laws. Or they can watch as the majority exacerbates the nation's epidemic of gun violence by imposing a vision of the Second Amendment that data has indicated leads to more handgun-related homicides,"" Stern added in an article Monday. ""The choice has never been so clear. And the stakes can be measured in human lives.  The potentially landmark case, according to SCOTUSblog, ""will be argued in the fall, with a decision expected sometime next year."" The justices' decision to take up the case comes just weeks after President Joe Biden announced six initial actions to begin tackling the nation's ""gun violence public health epidemic"" and signed an executive order to establish a 36-member commission that will analyze arguments for and against reforming the high court. Shortly after Biden's move to create a commission—which controversially includes George Mason University Law School professor and Federalist Society contributor Adam White—Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined with Reps. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) to introduce a bill to expand the court by four seats, bringing the total to 13. If passed, the Judiciary Act of 2021 would allow Biden to restore a left-leaning majority, depending on his appointments. After the court's announcement about the gun case, progressives reiterated support for expanding the nation's top court.  Referencing recent shootings and demands for stricter gun laws at the federal level, Elie Mystal, The Nation's justice correspondent, wrote in late March that ""regardless of the outcome in Congress, the conservative-controlled Supreme Court will not allow us to have commonsense gun regulation, let alone any ambitious, progressive legislation to get guns off the streets, like they do in other countries that don't have mass shootings every other day."" Mystal continued: Sharing the piece in a pair of tweets Monday, Mystal wrote that ""Democrats COULD put 10 more justices on the court to STOP THIS MADNESS... but nooo, Democrats want to pass gun reform *legislation* as if there a chance in hell this Supreme Court would uphold anything coming out of the Biden administration."" Noting the impact of Biden's predecessor appointing three justices in his single term, Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon issued a warning to policymakers on Monday: ""Expand the court or let [former President] Donald Trump's justices make our mass shooting epidemic even worse."" This case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Corlett, will address whether the state's denial of two men's applications for concealed-carry licenses for self-defense violated the Second Amendment. New York state law requires anyone who wants a license to carry a handgun outside their home to show a ""proper cause."" ""California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have similar laws,"" reported the New York Times, citing gun rights groups. ""Federal appeals courts have generally rejected challenges to such restrictions,"" including the 2nd Circuit in this case, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court.   So do we.

77,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/apr/27/the-clockwork-universe-is-free-will-an-illusion,"A growing chorus of scientists and philosophers argue that free will does not exist. Could they be right? Last modified on Tue 4 May 2021 10.01 BST Towards the end of a conversation dwelling on some of the deepest metaphysical puzzles regarding the nature of human existence, the philosopher Galen Strawson paused, then asked me: “Have you spoken to anyone else yet who’s received weird email?” He navigated to a file on his computer and began reading from the alarming messages he and several other scholars had received over the past few years. Some were plaintive, others abusive, but all were fiercely accusatory. “Last year you all played a part in destroying my life,” one person wrote. “I lost everything because of you – my son, my partner, my job, my home, my mental health. All because of you, you told me I had no control, how I was not responsible for anything I do, how my beautiful six-year-old son was not responsible for what he did … Goodbye, and good luck with the rest of your cancerous, evil, pathetic existence.” “Rot in your own shit Galen,” read another note, sent in early 2015. “Your wife, your kids your friends, you have smeared all there [sic] achievements you utter fucking prick,” wrote the same person, who subsequently warned: “I’m going to fuck you up.” And then, days later, under the subject line “Hello”: “I’m coming for you.” “This was one where we had to involve the police,” Strawson said. Thereafter, the violent threats ceased. It isn’t unheard of for philosophers to receive death threats. The Australian ethicist Peter Singer, for example, has received many, in response to his argument that, in highly exceptional circumstances, it might be morally justifiable to kill newborn babies with severe disabilities. But Strawson, like others on the receiving end of this particular wave of abuse, had merely expressed a longstanding position in an ancient debate that strikes many as the ultimate in “armchair philosophy”, wholly detached from the emotive entanglements of real life. They all deny that human beings possess free will. They argue that our choices are determined by forces beyond our ultimate control – perhaps even predetermined all the way back to the big bang – and that therefore nobody is ever wholly responsible for their actions. Reading back over the emails, Strawson, who gives the impression of someone far more forgiving of other people’s flaws than of his own, found himself empathising with his harassers’ distress. “I think for these people it’s just an existential catastrophe,” he said. “And I think I can see why.”  The difficulty in explaining the enigma of free will to those unfamiliar with the subject isn’t that it’s complex or obscure. It’s that the experience of possessing free will – the feeling that we are the authors of our choices – is so utterly basic to everyone’s existence that it can be hard to get enough mental distance to see what’s going on. Suppose you find yourself feeling moderately hungry one afternoon, so you walk to the fruit bowl in your kitchen, where you see one apple and one banana. As it happens, you choose the banana. But it seems absolutely obvious that you were free to choose the apple – or neither, or both – instead. That’s free will: were you to rewind the tape of world history, to the instant just before you made your decision, with everything in the universe exactly the same, you’d have been able to make a different one. Nothing could be more self-evident. And yet according to a growing chorus of philosophers and scientists, who have a variety of different reasons for their view, it also can’t possibly be the case. “This sort of free will is ruled out, simply and decisively, by the laws of physics,” says one of the most strident of the free will sceptics, the evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne. Leading psychologists such as Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom agree, as apparently did the late Stephen Hawking, along with numerous prominent neuroscientists, including VS Ramachandran, who called free will “an inherently flawed and incoherent concept” in his endorsement of Sam Harris’s bestselling 2012 book Free Will, which also makes that argument. According to the public intellectual Yuval Noah Harari, free will is an anachronistic myth – useful in the past, perhaps, as a way of motivating people to fight against tyrants or oppressive ideologies, but rendered obsolete by the power of modern data science to know us better than we know ourselves, and thus to predict and manipulate our choices. Arguments against free will go back millennia, but the latest resurgence of scepticism has been driven by advances in neuroscience during the past few decades. Now that it’s possible to observe – thanks to neuroimaging – the physical brain activity associated with our decisions, it’s easier to think of those decisions as just another part of the mechanics of the material universe, in which “free will” plays no role. And from the 1980s onwards, various specific neuroscientific findings have offered troubling clues that our so-called free choices might actually originate in our brains several milliseconds, or even much longer, before we’re first aware of even thinking of them. Despite the criticism that this is all just armchair philosophy, the truth is that the stakes could hardly be higher. Were free will to be shown to be nonexistent – and were we truly to absorb the fact – it would “precipitate a culture war far more belligerent than the one that has been waged on the subject of evolution”, Harris has written. Arguably, we would be forced to conclude that it was unreasonable ever to praise or blame anyone for their actions, since they weren’t truly responsible for deciding to do them; or to feel guilt for one’s misdeeds, pride in one’s accomplishments, or gratitude for others’ kindness. And we might come to feel that it was morally unjustifiable to mete out retributive punishment to criminals, since they had no ultimate choice about their wrongdoing. Some worry that it might fatally corrode all human relations, since romantic love, friendship and neighbourly civility alike all depend on the assumption of choice: any loving or respectful gesture has to be voluntary for it to count. Peer over the precipice of the free will debate for a while, and you begin to appreciate how an already psychologically vulnerable person might be nudged into a breakdown, as was apparently the case with Strawson’s email correspondents. Harris has taken to prefacing his podcasts on free will with disclaimers, urging those who find the topic emotionally distressing to give them a miss. And Saul Smilansky, a professor of philosophy at the University of Haifa in Israel, who believes the popular notion of free will is a mistake, told me that if a graduate student who was prone to depression sought to study the subject with him, he would try to dissuade them. “Look, I’m naturally a buoyant person,” he said. “I have the mentality of a village idiot: it’s easy to make me happy. Nevertheless, the free will problem is really depressing if you take it seriously. It hasn’t made me happy, and in retrospect, if I were at graduate school again, maybe a different topic would have been preferable.” Smilansky is an advocate of what he calls “illusionism”, the idea that although free will as conventionally defined is unreal, it’s crucial people go on believing otherwise – from which it follows that an article like this one might be actively dangerous. (Twenty years ago, he said, he might have refused to speak to me, but these days free will scepticism was so widely discussed that “the horse has left the barn”.) “On the deepest level, if people really understood what’s going on – and I don’t think I’ve fully internalised the implications myself, even after all these years – it’s just too frightening and difficult,” Smilansky said. “For anyone who’s morally and emotionally deep, it’s really depressing and destructive. It would really threaten our sense of self, our sense of personal value. The truth is just too awful here.” The conviction that nobody ever truly chooses freely to do anything – that we’re the puppets of forces beyond our control – often seems to strike its adherents early in their intellectual careers, in a sudden flash of insight. “I was sitting in a carrel in Wolfson College [in Oxford] in 1975, and I had no idea what I was going to write my DPhil thesis about,” Strawson recalled. “I was reading something about Kant’s views on free will, and I was just electrified. That was it.” The logic, once glimpsed, seems coldly inexorable. Start with what seems like an obvious truth: anything that happens in the world, ever, must have been completely caused by things that happened before it. And those things must have been caused by things that happened before them – and so on, backwards to the dawn of time: cause after cause after cause, all of them following the predictable laws of nature, even if we haven’t figured all of those laws out yet. It’s easy enough to grasp this in the context of the straightforwardly physical world of rocks and rivers and internal combustion engines. But surely “one thing leads to another” in the world of decisions and intentions, too. Our decisions and intentions involve neural activity – and why would a neuron be exempt from the laws of physics any more than a rock? So in the fruit bowl example, there are physiological reasons for your feeling hungry in the first place, and there are causes – in your genes, your upbringing, or your current environment – for your choosing to address your hunger with fruit, rather than a box of doughnuts. And your preference for the banana over the apple, at the moment of supposed choice, must have been caused by what went before, presumably including the pattern of neurons firing in your brain, which was itself caused – and so on back in an unbroken chain to your birth, the meeting of your parents, their births and, eventually, the birth of the cosmos. But if all that’s true, there’s simply no room for the kind of free will you might imagine yourself to have when you see the apple and banana and wonder which one you’ll choose. To have what’s known in the scholarly jargon as “contra-causal” free will – so that if you rewound the tape of history back to the moment of choice, you could make a different choice – you’d somehow have to slip outside physical reality. To make a choice that wasn’t merely the next link in the unbroken chain of causes, you’d have to be able to stand apart from the whole thing, a ghostly presence separate from the material world yet mysteriously still able to influence it. But of course you can’t actually get to this supposed place that’s external to the universe, separate from all the atoms that comprise it and the laws that govern them. You just are some of the atoms in the universe, governed by the same predictable laws as all the rest. It was the French polymath Pierre-Simon Laplace, writing in 1814, who most succinctly expressed the puzzle here: how can there be free will, in a universe where events just crank forwards like clockwork? His thought experiment is known as Laplace’s demon, and his argument went as follows: if some hypothetical ultra-intelligent being – or demon – could somehow know the position of every atom in the universe at a single point in time, along with all the laws that governed their interactions, it could predict the future in its entirety. There would be nothing it couldn’t know about the world 100 or 1,000 years hence, down to the slightest quiver of a sparrow’s wing. You might think you made a free choice to marry your partner, or choose a salad with your meal rather than chips; but in fact Laplace’s demon would have known it all along, by extrapolating out along the endless chain of causes. “For such an intellect,” Laplace said, “nothing could be uncertain, and the future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes.” It’s true that since Laplace’s day, findings in quantum physics have indicated that some events, at the level of atoms and electrons, are genuinely random, which means they would be impossible to predict in advance, even by some hypothetical megabrain. But few people involved in the free will debate think that makes a critical difference. Those tiny fluctuations probably have little relevant impact on life at the scale we live it, as human beings. And in any case, there’s no more freedom in being subject to the random behaviours of electrons than there is in being the slave of predetermined causal laws. Either way, something other than your own free will seems to be pulling your strings. By far the most unsettling implication of the case against free will, for most who encounter it, is what it seems to say about morality: that nobody, ever, truly deserves reward or punishment for what they do, because what they do is the result of blind deterministic forces (plus maybe a little quantum randomness). “For the free will sceptic,” writes Gregg Caruso in his new book Just Deserts, a collection of dialogues with his fellow philosopher Daniel Dennett, “it is never fair to treat anyone as morally responsible.” Were we to accept the full implications of that idea, the way we treat each other – and especially the way we treat criminals – might change beyond recognition. Consider the case of Charles Whitman. Just after midnight on 1 August 1966, Whitman – an outgoing and apparently stable 25-year-old former US Marine – drove to his mother’s apartment in Austin, Texas, where he stabbed her to death. He returned home, where he killed his wife in the same manner. Later that day, he took an assortment of weapons to the top of a high building on the campus of the University of Texas, where he began shooting randomly for about an hour and a half. By the time Whitman was killed by police, 12 more people were dead, and one more died of his injuries years afterwards – a spree that remains the US’s 10th worst mass shooting. Within hours of the massacre, the authorities discovered a note that Whitman had typed the night before. “I don’t quite understand what compels me to type this letter,” he wrote. “Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I don’t really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I can’t recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts [which] constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks … After my death I wish that an autopsy would be performed to see if there is any visible physical disorder.” Following the first two murders, he added a coda: “Maybe research can prevent further tragedies of this type.” An autopsy was performed, revealing the presence of a substantial brain tumour, pressing on Whitman’s amygdala, the part of the brain governing “fight or flight” responses to fear. As the free will sceptics who draw on Whitman’s case concede, it’s impossible to know if the brain tumour caused Whitman’s actions. What seems clear is that it certainly could have done so – and that almost everyone, on hearing about it, undergoes some shift in their attitude towards him. It doesn’t make the killings any less horrific. Nor does it mean the police weren’t justified in killing him. But it does make his rampage start to seem less like the evil actions of an evil man, and more like the terrible symptom of a disorder, with Whitman among its victims. The same is true for another wrongdoer famous in the free-will literature, the anonymous subject of the 2003 paper Right Orbitofrontal Tumor with Paedophilia Symptom and Constructional Apraxia Sign, a 40-year-old schoolteacher who suddenly developed paedophilic urges and began seeking out child pornography, and was subsequently convicted of child molestation. Soon afterwards, complaining of headaches, he was diagnosed with a brain tumour; when it was removed, his paedophilic urges vanished. A year later, they returned – as had his tumour, detected in another brain scan. If you find the presence of a brain tumour in these cases in any way exculpatory, though, you face a difficult question: what’s so special about a brain tumour, as opposed to all the other ways in which people’s brains cause them to do things? When you learn about the specific chain of causes that were unfolding inside Charles Whitman’s skull, it has the effect of seeming to make him less personally responsible for the terrible acts he committed. But by definition, anyone who commits any immoral act has a brain in which a chain of prior causes had unfolded, leading to the act; if that weren’t the case, they’d never have committed the act. “A neurological disorder appears to be just a special case of physical events giving rise to thoughts and actions,” is how Harris expresses it. “Understanding the neurophysiology of the brain, therefore, would seem to be as exculpatory as finding a tumour in it.” It appears to follow that as we understand ever more about how the brain works, we’ll illuminate the last shadows in which something called “free will” might ever have lurked – and we’ll be forced to concede that a criminal is merely someone unlucky enough to find himself at the end of a causal chain that culminates in a crime. We can still insist the crime in question is morally bad; we just can’t hold the criminal individually responsible. (Or at least that’s where the logic seems to lead our modern minds: there’s a rival tradition, going back to the ancient Greeks, which holds that you can be held responsible for what’s fated to happen to you anyway.) For Caruso, who teaches philosophy at the State University of New York, what all this means is that retributive punishment – punishing a criminal because he deserves it, rather than to protect the public, or serve as a warning to others – can’t ever be justified. Like Strawson, he has received email abuse from people disturbed by the implications. Retribution is central to all modern systems of criminal justice, yet ultimately, Caruso thinks, “it’s a moral injustice to hold someone responsible for actions that are beyond their control. It’s capricious.” Indeed some psychological research, he points out, suggests that people believe in free will partly because they want to justify their appetite for retribution. “What seems to happen is that people come across an action they disapprove of; they have a high desire to blame or punish; so they attribute to the perpetrator the degree of control [over their own actions] that would be required to justify blaming them.” (It’s no accident that the free will controversy is entangled in debates about religion: following similar logic, sinners must freely choose to sin, in order for God’s retribution to be justified.) Caruso is an advocate of what he calls the “public health-quarantine” model of criminal justice, which would transform the institutions of punishment in a radically humane direction. You could still restrain a murderer, on the same rationale that you can require someone infected by Ebola to observe a quarantine: to protect the public. But you’d have no right to make the experience any more unpleasant than was strictly necessary for public protection. And you would be obliged to release them as soon as they no longer posed a threat. (The main focus, in Caruso’s ideal world, would be on redressing social problems to try stop crime happening in the first place – just as public health systems ought to focus on preventing epidemics happening to begin with.) It’s tempting to try to wriggle out of these ramifications by protesting that, while people might not choose their worst impulses – for murder, say – they do have the choice not to succumb to them. You can feel the urge to kill someone but resist it, or even seek psychiatric help. You can take responsibility for the state of your personality. And don’t we all do that, all the time, in more mundane ways, whenever we decide to acquire a new professional skill, become a better listener, or finally get fit? But this is not the escape clause it might seem. After all, the free will sceptics insist, if you do manage to change your personality in some admirable way, you must already have possessed the kind of personality capable of implementing such a change – and you didn’t choose that. None of this requires us to believe that the worst atrocities are any less appalling than we previously thought. But it does entail that the perpetrators can’t be held personally to blame. If you’d been born with Hitler’s genes, and experienced Hitler’s upbringing, you would be Hitler – and ultimately it’s only good fortune that you weren’t. In the end, as Strawson puts it, “luck swallows everything”. Given how watertight the case against free will can appear, it may be surprising to learn that most philosophers reject it: according to a 2009 survey, conducted by the website PhilPapers, only about 12% of them are persuaded by it. And the disagreement can be fraught, partly because free will denial belongs to a wider trend that drives some philosophers spare – the tendency for those trained in the hard sciences to make sweeping pronouncements about debates that have raged in philosophy for years, as if all those dull-witted scholars were just waiting for the physicists and neuroscientists to show up. In one chilly exchange, Dennett paid a backhanded compliment to Harris, who has a PhD in neuroscience, calling his book “remarkable” and “valuable” – but only because it was riddled with so many wrongheaded claims: “I am grateful to Harris for saying, so boldly and clearly, what less outgoing scientists are thinking but keeping to themselves.” What’s still more surprising, and hard to wrap one’s mind around, is that most of those who defend free will don’t reject the sceptics’ most dizzying assertion – that every choice you ever make might have been determined in advance. So in the fruit bowl example, a majority of philosophers agree that if you rewound the tape of history to the moment of choice, with everything in the universe exactly the same, you couldn’t have made a different selection. That kind of free will is “as illusory as poltergeists”, to quote Dennett. What they claim instead is that this doesn’t matter: that even though our choices may be determined, it makes sense to say we’re free to choose. That’s why they’re known as “compatibilists”: they think determinism and free will are compatible. (There are many other positions in the debate, including some philosophers, many Christians among them, who think we really do have “ghostly” free will; and others who think the whole so-called problem is a chimera, resulting from a confusion of categories, or errors of language.) To those who find the case against free will persuasive, compatibilism seems outrageous at first glance. How can we possibly be free to choose if we aren’t, in fact, you know, free to choose? But to grasp the compatibilists’ point, it helps first to think about free will not as a kind of magic, but as a mundane sort of skill – one which most adults possess, most of the time. As the compatibilist Kadri Vihvelin writes, “we have the free will we think we have, including the freedom of action we think we have … by having some bundle of abilities and being in the right kind of surroundings.” The way most compatibilists see things, “being free” is just a matter of having the capacity to think about what you want, reflect on your desires, then act on them and sometimes get what you want. When you choose the banana in the normal way – by thinking about which fruit you’d like, then taking it – you’re clearly in a different situation from someone who picks the banana because a fruit-obsessed gunman is holding a pistol to their head; or someone afflicted by a banana addiction, compelled to grab every one they see. In all of these scenarios, to be sure, your actions belonged to an unbroken chain of causes, stretching back to the dawn of time. But who cares? The banana-chooser in one of them was clearly more free than in the others. “Harris, Pinker, Coyne – all these scientists, they all make the same two-step move,” said Eddy Nahmias, a compatibilist philosopher at Georgia State University in the US. “Their first move is always to say, ‘well, here’s what free will means’” – and it’s always something nobody could ever actually have, in the reality in which we live. “And then, sure enough, they deflate it. But once you have that sort of balloon in front of you, it’s very easy to deflate it, because any naturalistic account of the world will show that it’s false.” Consider hypnosis. A doctrinaire free will sceptic might feel obliged to argue that a person hypnotised into making a particular purchase is no less free than someone who thinks about it, in the usual manner, before reaching for their credit card. After all, their idea of free will requires that the choice wasn’t fully determined by prior causes; yet in both cases, hypnotised and non-hypnotised, it was. “But come on, that’s just really annoying,” said Helen Beebee, a philosopher at the University of Manchester who has written widely on free will, expressing an exasperation commonly felt by compatibilists toward their rivals’ more outlandish claims. “In some sense, I don’t care if you call it ‘free will’ or ‘acting freely’ or anything else – it’s just that it obviously does matter, to everybody, whether they get hypnotised into doing things or not.” Granted, the compatibilist version of free will may be less exciting. But it doesn’t follow that it’s worthless. Indeed, it may be (in another of Dennett’s phrases) the only kind of “free will worth wanting”. You experience the desire for a certain fruit, you act on it, and you get the fruit, with no external gunmen or internal disorders influencing your choice. How could a person ever be freer than that? Thinking of free will this way also puts a different spin on some notorious experiments conducted in the 80s by the American neuroscientist Benjamin Libet, which have been interpreted as offering scientific proof that free will doesn’t exist. Wiring his subjects to a brain scanner, and asking them to flex their hands at a moment of their choosing, Libet seemed to show that their choice was detectable from brain activity 300 milliseconds before they made a conscious decision. (Other studies have indicated activity up to 10 seconds before a conscious choice.) How could these subjects be said to have reached their decisions freely, if the lab equipment knew their decisions so far in advance? But to most compatibilists, this is a fuss about nothing. Like everything else, our conscious choices are links in a causal chain of neural processes, so of course some brain activity precedes the moment at which we become aware of them. From this down-to-earth perspective, there’s also no need to start panicking that cases like Charles Whitman’s might mean we could never hold anybody responsible for their misdeeds, or praise them for their achievements. (In their defence, several free will sceptics I spoke to had their reasons for not going that far, either.) Instead, we need only ask whether someone had the normal ability to choose rationally, reflecting on the implications of their actions. We all agree that newborn babies haven’t developed that yet, so we don’t blame them for waking us in the night; and we believe most non-human animals don’t possess it – so few of us rage indignantly at wasps for stinging us. Someone with a severe neurological or developmental impairment would surely lack it, too, perhaps including Whitman. But as for everyone else: “Bernie Madoff is the example I always like to use,” said Nahmias. “Because it’s so clear that he knew what he was doing, and that he knew that what he was doing was wrong, and he did it anyway.” He did have the ability we call “free will” – and used it to defraud his investors of more than $17bn. To the free will sceptics, this is all just a desperate attempt at face-saving and changing the subject – an effort to redefine free will not as the thing we all feel, when faced with a choice, but as something else, unworthy of the name. “People hate the idea that they aren’t agents who can make free choices,” Jerry Coyne has argued. Harris has accused Dennett of approaching the topic as if he were telling someone bent on discovering the lost city of Atlantis that they ought to be satisfied with a trip to Sicily. After all, it meets some of the criteria: it’s an island in the sea, home to a civilisation with ancient roots. But the facts remain: Atlantis doesn’t exist. And when it felt like it wasn’t inevitable you’d choose the banana, the truth is that it actually was. It’s tempting to dismiss the free will controversy as irrelevant to real life, on the grounds that we can’t help but feel as though we have free will, whatever the philosophical truth may be. I’m certainly going to keep responding to others as though they had free will: if you injure me, or someone I love, I can guarantee I’m going to be furious, instead of smiling indulgently on the grounds that you had no option. In this experiential sense, free will just seems to be a given. But is it? When my mind is at its quietest – for example, drinking coffee early in the morning, before the four-year-old wakes up – things are liable to feel different. In such moments of relaxed concentration, it seems clear to me that my intentions and choices, like all my other thoughts and emotions, arise unbidden in my awareness. There’s no sense in which it feels like I’m their author. Why do I put down my coffee mug and head to the shower at the exact moment I do so? Because the intention to do so pops up, caused, no doubt, by all sorts of activity in my brain – but activity that lies outside my understanding, let alone my command. And it’s exactly the same when it comes to those weightier decisions that seem to express something profound about the kind of person I am: whether to attend the funeral of a certain relative, say, or which of two incompatible career opportunities to pursue. I can spend hours or even days engaged in what I tell myself is “reaching a decision” about those, when what I’m really doing, if I’m honest, is just vacillating between options – until at some unpredictable moment, or when an external deadline forces the issue, the decision to commit to one path or another simply arises. This is what Harris means when he declares that, on close inspection, it’s not merely that free will is an illusion, but that the illusion of free will is itself an illusion: watch yourself closely, and you don’t even seem to be free. “If one pays sufficient attention,” he told me by email, “one can notice that there’s no subject in the middle of experience – there is only experience. And everything we experience simply arises on its own.” This is an idea with roots in Buddhism, and echoed by others, including the philosopher David Hume: when you look within, there’s no trace of an internal commanding officer, autonomously issuing decisions. There’s only mental activity, flowing on. Or as Arthur Rimbaud wrote, in a letter to a friend in 1871: “I am a spectator at the unfolding of my thought; I watch it, I listen to it.” There are reasons to agree with Saul Smilansky that it might be personally and societally detrimental for too many people to start thinking in this way, even if it turns out it’s the truth. (Dennett, although he thinks we do have free will, takes a similar position, arguing that it’s morally irresponsible to promote free-will denial.) In one set of studies in 2008, the psychologists Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan Schooler asked one group of participants to read an excerpt from The Astonishing Hypothesis by Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, in which he suggests free will is an illusion. The subjects thus primed to doubt the existence of free will proved significantly likelier than others, in a subsequent stage of the experiment, to cheat in a test where there was money at stake. Other research has reported a diminished belief in free will to less willingness to volunteer to help others, to lower levels of commitment in relationships, and lower levels of gratitude. Unsuccessful attempts to replicate Vohs and Schooler’s findings have called them into question. But even if the effects are real, some free will sceptics argue that the participants in such studies are making a common mistake – and one that might get cleared up rather rapidly, were the case against free will to become better known and understood. Study participants who suddenly become immoral seem to be confusing determinism with fatalism – the idea that if we don’t have free will, then our choices don’t really matter, so we might as well not bother trying to make good ones, and just do as we please instead. But in fact it doesn’t follow from our choices being determined that they don’t matter. It might matter enormously whether you choose to feed your children a diet rich in vegetables or not; or whether you decide to check carefully in both directions before crossing a busy road. It’s just that (according to the sceptics) you don’t get to make those choices freely. In any case, were free will really to be shown to be nonexistent, the implications might not be entirely negative. It’s true that there’s something repellent about an idea that seems to require us to treat a cold-blooded murderer as not responsible for his actions, while at the same time characterising the love of a parent for a child as nothing more than what Smilansky calls “the unfolding of the given” – mere blind causation, devoid of any human spark. But there’s something liberating about it, too. It’s a reason to be gentler with yourself, and with others. For those of us prone to being hard on ourselves, it’s therapeutic to keep in the back of your mind the thought that you might be doing precisely as well as you were always going to be doing – that in the profoundest sense, you couldn’t have done any more. And for those of us prone to raging at others for their minor misdeeds, it’s calming to consider how easily their faults might have been yours. (Sure enough, some research has linked disbelief in free will to increased kindness.) Harris argues that if we fully grasped the case against free will, it would be difficult to hate other people: how can you hate someone you don’t blame for their actions? Yet love would survive largely unscathed, since love is “the condition of our wanting those we love to be happy, and being made happy ourselves by that ethical and emotional connection”, neither of which would be undermined. And countless other positive aspects of life would be similarly untouched. As Strawson puts it, in a world without a belief in free will, “strawberries would still taste just as good”. Those early-morning moments aside, I personally can’t claim to find the case against free will ultimately persuasive; it’s just at odds with too much else that seems obviously true about life. Yet even if only entertained as a hypothetical possibility, free will scepticism is an antidote to that bleak individualist philosophy which holds that a person’s accomplishments truly belong to them alone – and that you’ve therefore only yourself to blame if you fail. It’s a reminder that accidents of birth might affect the trajectories of our lives far more comprehensively than we realise, dictating not only the socioeconomic position into which we’re born, but also our personalities and experiences as a whole: our talents and our weaknesses, our capacity for joy, and our ability to overcome tendencies toward violence, laziness or despair, and the paths we end up travelling. There is a deep sense of human fellowship in this picture of reality – in the idea that, in our utter exposure to forces beyond our control, we might all be in the same boat, clinging on for our lives, adrift on the storm-tossed ocean of luck.

78,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/650166130/0/phoenix/nation~Indianapolis-mass-shooting-proves-that-red-flag-laws-work-when-they-are-actually-used/,"In the aftermath of the mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis, Americans were confronted with a stream of news articles lamenting the failure of Indiana’s red flag law, which was designed to disarm people who pose a threat to themselves or others for a brief, temporary period. “Indiana’s red flag law did not stop FedEx gunman who killed eight people at Indianapolis facility” was the headline of a CBS News piece, a sentiment that was echoed across the media landscape. But the American people — especially our nation’s lawmakers — need to understand a crucial truth: It was not red flag laws that failed the victims and survivors of Indianapolis, but rather the authorities who were charged with implementing it. The Indianapolis shooter came to the attention of law enforcement in March 2020, when his mother went to the local police precinct and told officers that her son was thinking about killing himself, and might even try to die via “suicide by cop.” In response, the police came to the shooter’s home and removed a recently purchased shotgun under Indiana’s red flag law. Up to this point, the red flag law was functioning as intended. The Marion County prosecutor now had two days to file an order prohibiting the suspect from buying or having guns, after which a judge would have up to 14 days to hold a hearing. But a breakdown occurred, and law enforcement did not file a case. As a result, there was nothing to stop the shooter from replacing his confiscated shotgun with two assault-style rifles — the same rifles he apparently used to wreak so much human devastation last week. This tragedy illustrates a fundamental truth about all of our laws: They’re only as strong as society’s will and capacity to implement them. And when it comes to red flag laws, the data shows they are highly effective when properly implemented — and Indiana, by coincidence, is a prime example. In the decade since Indiana passed the nation’s second red flag law in 2005, the state’s firearms suicide rate decreased by 7.5%. One study estimates that Indiana’s red flag law averted one suicide for approximately every 10 gun removals. Given that nearly two-thirds of all U.S. gun deaths — an average of 64 a day — are suicides, it is no exaggeration to say that red flag laws are one of the most effective tools we have when it comes to combating our nation’s gun violence crisis. Mass shootings: After Columbine shooting, I combed through the internet's dark corners. Will we ever learn? Thanks in no small part to Indiana’s success, 19 states and Washington, D.C., now have red flag laws — and seven of those laws were signed by Republican governors. But as we learned in Indianapolis, when properly implemented, red flag laws can also be a lifesaving tool for preventing mass shootings. One analysis of mass shootings found that in 54% of these incidents, the shooter exhibited warning signs that they posed a risk to themselves or others. In states with red flag laws, family and law enforcement can act on these warning signs: ►In California, for instance, the police used the state’s red flag law to remove 26 firearms from a man who had threatened to shoot or bomb the employees of his family’s business, his family and himself. ►In Broward County, Florida, a judge ordered that 67 firearms be removed from the home of a bailiff who had simulated shooting people from the fifth-floor atrium of the courthouse, calling them “easy prey.” ►And in Washington state, the suspected leader of the state chapter of the Atomwaffen Division, a neo-Nazi terrorist network, was required to temporarily relinquish all of his firearms — which included five military-style rifles — after law enforcement found that he was conducting weapons training and preparing to commit violence. Martin Luther King III: Death penalty was never intended to give Black families like mine so-called justice In light of stories like this, it should come as no surprise that the Biden-Harris administration is also a strong supporter of red flag laws. A few weeks ago, President Joe Biden asked the Department of Justice to publish model red flag legislation that states can use to craft their own laws. As the president noted in a Rose Garden address announcing a broad slate of gun safety actions, the “vast majority of Americans support” red flag laws. Surveys back this up — a 2019 poll found that 85% of voters were in favor of federal red flag law — including 78% of gun owners. Would such a law prevent every mass shooting or suicide? Of course not. But the data proves that more red flag laws will lead to fewer American flags draped over coffins or flown at half-staff. And if you aren’t convinced by the data, just look to the destruction in Indianapolis, where a red flag law came agonizingly close to averting a tragedy.

79,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/covid-quarantine-didn-t-stop-antisemitic-attacks-rising-near-historic-ncna1265425," Follow think More from NBC © 2021 NBCNEWS.COM Even in a year when people were mostly quarantined, hate found a way. As the medical community raced to create vaccines and places of business adapted to remote work, bigots innovated, as well. One of the painful side effects of the pandemic that raged across America was the emergence of new uses of technology to weaponize harassment and new conspiracy theories to promote hate. A high school’s online class was disrupted by an unknown participant who bombarded the teacher with messages in the comments section that read, “Burn like a Jew.” In our annual Anti-Defamation League Audit of Antisemitic Incidents for the 2020 calendar year, released Tuesday, we found that Jews in the U.S. reported a disturbing 2,024 incidents of antisemitism last year, a rate of harassment 10 percent higher than in the year before and one of the highest overall in the last five years. Many of the incidents featured these technological and conspiratorial innovations. Our audit paid particular attention to the emergence of Zoombombing, the grotesque practice of disrupting Zoom meetings or other online video events with antisemitic bile, racism or the display of swastikas. We found 196 antisemitic attacks in which racists intentionally disrupted live videoconferences. Of those incidents, 114 targeted Jewish institutions, such as schools or synagogues. In one instance last April, a high school's online class was disrupted by an unknown participant who bombarded the teacher with messages in the comments section that read, ""Burn like a Jew."" In October, someone barged into a virtual class at a school in New York City and posted messages that read, ""Kill all Jews, Gas them all."" And in another of the frightening trends last year, a known white supremacist hacker tuned in to five Zoom sessions, in one case pulling up his shirt in front of a meeting of a Jewish youth group to reveal a swastika tattoo. Covid-19 times also inspired some unique twists on the world's oldest hatred. For example, we witnessed the germination and growth of online conspiracy theories blaming Jews and other minorities for spreading the coronavirus itself. While some of these conspiracies are likely to have originated in online white supremacist forums, they quickly infected mainstream discussions, as people tried to find outlets for their anger over the lockdowns, mask requirements and other restrictions on their daily lives and livelihoods. Indeed, antisemitism thrives at times of uncertainty or unrest, which explains why Covid-19 fueled and fed into age-old antisemitic stereotypes about Jews' spreading disease. The turbulent election year provided further fodder, as QAnon conspiracies reached a fever pitch, tinged with long-standing antisemitic tropes. The QAnon belief that a global ""cabal"" is involved in rituals of child sacrifice has its roots in the antisemitic trope of blood libel, the smear that Jews murder Christian children for ritualistic purposes. In addition, QAnon has a deep-seated hatred for George Soros, whose name has become synonymous with perceived Jewish meddling in global affairs. And QAnon's obsession with a global elite of bankers also has deeply antisemitic undertones. It's also not surprising the QAnon followers embrace other bizarre theories, such as the member of Congress who spouts antisemitic accusations about Jewish ""space lasers"" — the bizarre notion that the Rothschilds, a famous family of Jewish bankers, used a secret, powerful space laser to intentionally set wildfires in California. Though QAnon was mostly identified with the right, slander was generated from both ends of the ideological spectrum last year — a reminder that no political persuasion is immune to intolerance. As these hateful notions cross-pollinated, they also moved to platforms beyond Zoom. Since it was launched last April, the social media app Clubhouse — an audio-only platform that allows users to listen in on podcast-like presentations, as well as conversations more akin to conference calls — has exploded in popularity, adding millions of users as people sought an outlet from pandemic doldrums. Antisemitic content has exploded along with it. As an early adopter of the invitation-only platform, I joined in a Clubhouse room just last week to discuss the blatant antisemitism users were hearing in clubroom discussions. The data are stark, especially when you consider that the ADL Audit focuses on strict criteria for historical context: It doesn't attempt to quantify the total amount of antisemitism online, where the hatred swirls like a tsunami. We don't count the thousands of antisemitic websites and bile spewed almost daily in white supremacist chat rooms, for example, while we do count cyberattacks against Jewish institutions. Of course, in the last year, Jews were threatened and intimidated in more traditional ways, too. Nazi swastikas were used in 517 acts of vandalism. There were 331 antisemitic incidents attributed to known extremist groups or people inspired by extremist ideology. White supremacist groups carried out 277 antisemitic propaganda distributions, such as leafleting or unfurling large banners over highway overpasses, affecting both small towns and large metropolitan areas. These incidents affected not just Jews but all people living in the affected communities, as fears rose about the presence of hate groups in those areas. Moreover, because antisemitism so often has been the canary in the coal mine of hatred, the historic high of antisemitic incidents of the past several years should alarm far more than Jewish people. Though no other minority group in the U.S. faces the same rate of hate crimes as Jewish Americans, we know from recent FBI data that the numbers of incidents are up for communities across the board. Black, Latinx, Asian and Muslim Americans are all being increasingly targeted. As communities reopen and people return to the real world, the message of our data is clear: We must remain vigilant. Two years ago Tuesday, a white supremacist opened fire on the last day of Passover at the Chabad of Poway synagogue in California, an attempted act of widespread slaughter that resulted in one death and many injuries. Nearly four months ago, white supremacists and other extremists led an insurrection at our nation's capital that featured antisemitic and other hate symbols. Mass shooting incidents are tragically returning to form as regular occurrences, including attacks that have left deep wounds in the Sikh and the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Given the rise in AAPI hate this past year, the ugly open wound of racism against the Black community and vile conspiracy theories targeting immigrants, the odds of a large-scale, hate-fueled tragedy loom large. In the face of the evidence and considering the consequences, let's make 2021 the year we turned the corner on Covid-19 — and also mounted an Operation Warp Speed to stop the virus of hate once and for all.

The article about the Red Flag law pointed to Mears for failure to enforce the statute, yet conceded there is no mandate to file. Nowhere in the article is the source of the automatic weapons mentioned. Who sold or gave them as gifts? Could the purveyor of the guns have known about the incident in March 2020 as part of an arrest record? The article asks various politicians and lawyers to opine and to criticize Mears for not enforcing a red flag style law. Let's look at the law: the 14 days waiting period would not stop someone from buying a gun during that period. In fact, the eight red flag incidents mentioned in the article apparently have not had any resolution. I am disappointed in this article as it lacked depth of information such as reciting the specific language of the statute and omitted research about the real source of the weapons. Nevertheless, there were plenty of quotations from people criticizing Mears, who has to work with a statute that weakens a prosecutor's ability to keep guns out of the hands of those threatening to harm self or others. So my question is: why can't the arrest of March 2020 itself be enough of a red flag accessible to purveyors of guns to prevent the sale? And this red flag statute does not even cover a gun that might be transferred by gift. It's not about the prosecutor, folks. Linda Robb Indianapolis I applaud FedEx for not allowing cellphones at work. Every time I go to any store whether a gas station, grocery store or a department store, you have to wait for the clerk or cashier to put their phone down before they can wait on you. As fast paced as a FedEx warehouse can be, just think of all the injuries they are preventing. David Groves Indianapolis In his April 17 article, ""Mass shooting won't alter gun culture,"" James Briggs referenced a Bureau of Justice Statistics report that over half of incarcerated individuals who used guns in their crimes stole them. He went on to say that 43% purchased them on the black market (also, I believe, most likely stolen). Briggs then makes the point that the stolen and illegally purchased guns had to come from somewhere; that being legitimate owners. He then offers the following opinion: ""The only way to suppress that market is to take steps that are political nonstarters in the U.S.: Make private gun ownership much more restrictive, if not outright unlawful."" I invite Mr. Briggs to expand his thinking to another somewhat controversial, yet entirely logical solution: Mandatory storage requirements. Require firearms owners to store their guns behind at least one level of locked storage inside their homes. I believe one of our old sayings applies here: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" We lock up our spare gasoline and rat poison, why not our guns? The counter to that is ""But if my gun is locked up, I can't get to it quickly in an emergency."" If someone feels they need immediate access to a gun, there are many 'lock-boxes' on the market that allow rapid access through a short combination of key presses. Then there is the eventual argument, ""But it will take too much time to enter a combination and get my gun out."" To that, I call ""Bull!"" If one is not coherent enough to enter a four or five-key code after being awoken in the middle of the night, then they are not coherent enough to be confronting someone with a loaded gun. Finally, there should be mandatory reporting of stolen firearms and penalties for those who do not properly store their guns. There is much rhetoric over constitutional rights and gun ownership. As I see it, gun owners (myself included) need to step up and work to become part of the solution, not part of the problem. If we don't, I'm afraid emotion and fear will ultimately win out over logic, and we will see incredible restrictions. Richard Paugh Indianapolis What happened in Indianapolis could have been stopped if the State of Indiana had a counseling program that worked with youth who had mental health issues like the State of Colorado created. In Indiana trying to get help for children and youth who have growing mental health needs is somewhat of a nightmare. The family tried to get help and failed. If they had lived in Colorado, their child would have received mental health therapy that he needed. Such a program would cost money, and our children and youth are the future of our country. The state needs a statewide mental health program directed towards youth with severe mental health issues. James Hartle Greenwood I am a citizen living near one of the most beautiful Nature Preserves in the state Marott Park Nature preserve. Both the White River and Williams Creek that flow along or through this preserve were once relatively predictable streams of water. In the early part of this century, Williams Creek was considered one of the most pristine and environmentally diverse streams in the state. As the result of extensive development along the river both north of and in Marion County, there has been a huge destruction of the floodplain in the Marott Park State Nature Preserve. When rapidly moving and intensive rainstorms dump large amounts of water in a short period of time, both the velocity and the vertical rise of the river is increased. The remaining floodplain is unable to absorb the resulting rush of water resulting in extensive erosion along the banks of the river and stream, down the hills of this park, and to the wetland areas displacing many animal species once common in Marott Park. The friends of Marott Park are currently attempting to mitigate some of this damage, but the destruction has been very severe. Come walk with me there and you can see for yourself. If signed into law, SB 389 will eliminate protections for a majority of Indiana wetlands —increasing our susceptibility to flooding, loss of groundwater recharge, loss of water purification, and the elimination of wildlife habitat as described above. Considering all that has been learned and publicly reported about the negative impacts of such a deregulation, no prudent public official should support this bill, which contains a policy that will endanger our future water resources. The Indiana Finance Authority is closely studying future supply and demand. Please veto this Bill SB 389, and allow further study and recommendations to be made by the concerned state and not for profit environmental groups as well as all concerned Hoosiers. Heliene Houdek Indianapolis On average a person dies by suicide every eight hours in our state of Indiana. Within the year 2017, almost five times as many people died by suicide than in drunk driving accidents (afsp.org). Suicide is the second leading cause of death of people ages 15-34. Indiana is ranked 25th in the leader board for the highest number of suicides in 2019. This is an area that Hoosiers should not let us rank in the middle of. Mental health is a vital aspect of people's lives. Hoosiers must end the stigma around mental health. We must come together and show Indiana that mental health matters and stop seeing so many young and old individuals suffer alone in the dark. The best thing to do is come together and spread awareness of mental health concerns; also, checking up on our friends and family members who may be struggling and educate ourselves about what to do if someone is contemplating suicide. Please take the time to add the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number to your phone 1-800-273-8255. You never know when your helping hand may save a life. Jessica Greenway Bloomington I am writing to impress upon you the importance of Senate Bill 32 as put forth by Senator J.D Ford. I am a resident of the city of Indianapolis and a strong opponent of Conversion Therapy. I am an active and proud member of the LGBTQ community. In my youth, conversion therapy was suggested to my parents just as they were coming to the point of knowing of my sexual orientation. After educating themselves, they chose not to pursue Conversion Therapy due to the lasting mental damage and or deaths by suicide that were due to Conversion therapy. Over thirty years later, I believe I am still alive and thriving because they chose not to use Conversion Therapy in order to address my sexual orientation. There has been an increase in the number of anti-LGBT bills being proposed on across the country. Conversion Therapy and the corresponding anti-LGBT bills need to be addressed and stopped. They don’t help or unite our communities. They only harm and divide. Angel Summers Indianapolis So you mow your lawn and keep it neat and trimmed. You started this spring by treating and weeding as well as seeding those patches that appeared over the winter. Many of your neighbors also take pride in their lawns and gardens. Then, as you drive home from work, you notice dandelions in one yard and another yard overgrown with weeds and you think “I better get my lawn treatment out and make sure those don't infect my lawn."" Isn’t it strange how you will “treat” (inoculate) your lawn to prevent your lawn being overrun (infected) by weeds and by doing so preventing your lawn spreading those weeds (infecting) to your neighbors. And yet you won’t take a vaccination for exactly the reason? John Morton Greenwood With the current approval of three COVID-19 vaccines, the vaccination rates in the U.S have been at an all-time high. Many states around the U.S have expanded the age range for vaccine recipients for those above the age of 18 which has allowed for a broader range of individuals to be vaccinated. Even with the growing availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, there’s still vaccine hesitancy amongst several groups of Americans, particularly young Americans. As a 22-year-old, I have seen my peers dismiss the importance of the vaccine and have even claimed that they are healthy enough to not need a vaccine. With an overwhelming number of young Americans showing hesitancy towards the COVID-19 vaccine, it could prolong the timeline of this pandemic. While the federal government has limited power in mandating the vaccine for all individuals, universities and employers could take a proactive step in increasing vaccination rates. If universities and employers were to require all enrolled students and employees to be vaccinated it would leave many with no choice but to take the vaccine. Besides, out of all the things in the world to harm a college student, an FDA-approved vaccine should be the least of their worries. Hassan Abdelwahab Fishers Employers in Indianapolis should require, or at least ask their employees to get a COVID-19 vaccine. As COVID-19 vaccines have become open to all individuals over the age of 16 in Indiana, there are new ethical and legal aspects that have appeared. Is it okay for employers to ask and perhaps more importantly, require their employees vaccinate themselves? Vaccines represent symbols of science and progress; they are medical treatments that allow for a strong community that stands together in solidarity. There are multiple reasons for requiring individuals for getting a COVID-19 vaccine. The immunity gained from a COVID-19 vaccine will protect individuals through antibody immunity. Obtaining a vaccine will also help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 just as masks and social distancing have done so far. Thwarting and stopping a pandemic requires the use of all resources that are available and the three vaccines that are accessible must be utilized to stop the spread of COVID-19. If all individuals that have access to the vaccine proceed and get vaccinated, we can protect individuals that do not have the ability to get vaccinated due to any disability. Even though the federal government has limited authority in mandating the vaccine, universities, businesses, and employers should push their students and employees to get vaccinated. Doing so would help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and help bring an end to the pandemic. Essa Siddiqui Fishers The ongoing pandemic has impacted the U.S in more ways than one. Only recently has the U.S begun to recover, and the number of cases decrease. Vaccines have played a major role in controlling the spread of the virus and will continue to be a major contributor. Mass vaccination of the public must occur in order to curb the spread and create herd immunity. In Indiana our local businesses have suffered, we have lost loved ones, and we have been holed up for too long. More than 700,000 cases and 13,000 deaths have been reported in Indiana alone. Very recently legislators have passed HB 1488, a bill that allow prohibits employers from requiring employees to receive an immunization that has been approved for emergency use. The COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for emergency use and have been 95% effective in those that have been inoculated. HB 1488 must be reconsidered and new bills must be passed in order to promote mass vaccination and create herd immunity. I urge our local legislators to take in to account the length of time this pandemic has lasted and how it has affected our communities. If normalcy is to return rules and regulation must be in place that promotes the use of the recent COVID-19 vaccines. By not requiring mandatory vaccinations more harm than good is done not only in the workplace, but in our communities as well. The freedom of choice is important to consider, if and only if, the personal freedom does not impede on another’s wellbeing. Manjit Kailey Greenwood I appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners are responsible, they follow safety protocols, keep guns and ammo locked up etc., and that recent mass shootings are as abhorrent to them as to non-gun owners. We all hate this equally, and anyone who claims to have an easy answer to this problem hasn’t been paying attention. Responsible gun owners are not creating mass shootings, but whether they like it or not, they are a participant in a deeply entrenched system of gun advocacy in this country, represented by gun lobbyists and local and federal representatives and a general reluctance to change any gun laws, preferring to lay blame elsewhere. It’s time to ask all gun owners to consider making some concessions to existing laws for the betterment of us all. When we drive our cars we have a responsibility to obey the rules of the road, but when someone runs a stop sign in your neighborhood do you let it go, or shake your fist and yell at them? This is no different. I don’t want my car taken away when some idiot runs a stop sign, but I don’t want them to do it again either. If advocacy groups and representatives know they have grass roots support among gun owners for select changes, perhaps some progress can be made, while still retaining the essence of the second amendment. David Allspaw Indianapolis It is time for Hoosiers, especially our legislators, who say they are pro-life to show that they don’t just have one issue in mind. They should be supporting mask-wearing (including the Governor who mandated it) and gun restrictions. There is no logical reason that anyone who is pro-life wouldn’t want to require background checks, a waiting period, registration, and limitations on the kinds of weapons citizens can own. Most people are not members of a militia and don’t need to be treated as such. We require auto registration, driver’s licenses, and auto insurance for people to drive cars, which are much less likely to kill people than guns. Let’s see some consistency from pro-life advocates indicating support for the health and safety of everyone, not just the unborn. And then after they support masks and gun restrictions, let’s work on pre-school, public education, day care, food insecurity, and health care. Joan FitzGibbon Indianapolis It’s been 25 years since our federal government last passed a gun safety law: that’s 25 years of families being devastated as their loved ones were killed or wounded, 25 years of survivors and activists demanding change, and 25 years of the gun lobby and its allies standing in the way of overwhelmingly popular, life-saving legislation. But now, that wait can finally be over. We deserve more than thoughts and prayers from our elected officials and our Senators, Todd Young and Mike Braun can be part of the solution. We need the US Senate to take action on background checks, to keep guns away from people who shouldn’t have them. As a Moms Demand Action volunteer, gun violence prevention is important to me because my husband is a teacher and my children are in school. They should be able to go to work and to school without having a fear that they won't come home. I urge our Senators to do what is right for our country and our community, and vote to pass background check legislation. We need more than thoughts and prayers to prevent gun violence –– we need action. And that begins with background checks and common sense gun laws. Amy Ledman Lafayette Brandon Scott Hole was placed on a mental health temporary hold in March 2020. Yet in July and September 2020 he purchased two assault rifles. Could a sensible background check have prevented the deaths of eight people and the suffering of their families and the others who were wounded and many of the workers at Fed Ex? To the 2nd Amendment rights people, clearly your thoughts and prayers have not worked. Our Declaration of Independence states “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"" and to me that outweighs your right, just like many other laws to protect people. It is time to enact laws to require total background checks on anyone wanting to purchase a firearm or even to be given a firearm. It would be a simple firearm license. The Declaration says these rights have been given to all humans by their creator, and which governments are created to protect. Joe Weingarten Fishers Fellow Hoosiers, 29 years ago my parents Michael and Linda Holmes were gunned down in their home. This city grieved with us. Over 1000 people came to pay their respects. Several hundred were at the funeral. You offered your thoughts, prayers, condolences. You shared our grief, disbelief, our anger, our pain. City leaders said they stood with us. What you didn't do is make any changes. It's 29 years later, and in the past three months we have now had three mass shootings in our capital city with 19 people dead in those three incidents. Hoosiers are once again offering their shared grief, pain and concern. Once again, what we aren't sharing is solutions. I have been listening for 29 years to the same tired arguments: Gun control doesn't work. Criminals won't obey the law anyway. 2nd amendment. On and on. Well the current solutions aren't working either. It's time for a real change. It's beyond time. We need loopholes closed, we need to have sensible regulation. Criminals can't use what they can't get their hands on. We need help. We need more than thoughts and prayers. Amy Webb Indianapolis The recent statistical data for the coronavirus sends a clear message. In Indiana, over the last month, daily new cases are up by 60%, and hospitalizations are up by over 40%. Both are now at higher levels than for most of last summer. Daily deaths are still down from a month ago, thanks to the increasing level of vaccinations among those at higher risk, but the number of coronavirus deaths in Indiana has actually started to trend upward in the last two weeks. In Michigan, over the last month, daily new cases have quadrupled, and daily deaths have tripled. Recently, there were a record-high 10,000 new cases reported in Michigan on a single day. If it can happen there, it can happen here. In Brazil, daily coronavirus deaths for the country now exceed 3000, more than double the record levels from last year. In India, over the last month, daily new cases have increased from 20,000 to over 200,000, and daily deaths have increased from 130 to over 1000. Furthermore, the numbers in India are continuing to rise at a faster rate than ever before. Worldwide, daily new coronavirus cases have surged back up to prior record levels. Also, if current trends continue, worldwide daily coronavirus deaths will surpass prior record levels within two weeks. The fourth wave has clearly arrived, spurred on by relaxed behaviors and more-contagious variants of the virus, and it should not be ignored. Virtually all of the new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are occurring among those who have not been vaccinated. In the U.S., we are fortunate to have ready access to highly effective vaccines. We will soon have more vaccine supply available in our country than we will have willing recipients. The biggest obstacle to reaching herd immunity in the US will become the reluctance of a sizable portion of the population to get the vaccine. If you have not yet been vaccinated or registered to be vaccinated, now is the time to take that step, both for yourself and for the sake of others. Dave Fox Carmel If the state doesn't use this budget increase as an opportunity to adequately reward teachers, they are outright devaluing the profession. Of course, in the past, there have been ways to deflect blame for the current avg. salary, putting it on the unions, but it seems pretty obvious now that the scapegoat is dead, and it's time to pay up. The article by Arika Herron did a really good job of pointing out the budget has to be there, and I think that point will help fuel the public conversation which could very well lead to change. Right now, is an incredible opportunity to award teachers, and if they don't allocate the funds necessary to do so I'll be disappointed. Eric Becker Indianapolis Our policing system has repeatedly led to acts of excessive force and unnecessary deaths. The protests of this past year have shown a growing resentment and outright fear of the police, but given the polarizing nature of this issue, a solution is both badly needed and elusive. That said, the Indiana House of Representatives is close to passing police reform via House Bill 1006. This policy change requires Indiana police to use de-escalation training: an approach that involves verbal conflict resolution instead of force. This is projected to halve incidents of police violence, as well as keep officers safer by avoiding situations that may cause them to fear for their lives. House Bill 1006 also prevents the usage of choke holds or turning off police body cameras. Granted, it is likely that this policy will not end our troubles. People of any political stance can grow defensive regarding this issue, and for good reason. Citizens want their safety, and a change in narrative that focuses on seeing them as people instead of threats may be the first step towards bridging the social divide in our state. Lucie Horvath South Bend Whenever the dissatisfaction with Congress peaks, we hear more advocacy for term limits. There are currently resolutions in both houses of Congress, calling for an amendment to the Constitution limiting Senators to twelve years and Representatives to six years. Sound like a good idea? I’m not sure. Term limits would regularly cleanse Congress and purge some bad actors, but also some good ones. And if you throw the bums out, who says the replacements won’t also be bums? The goal should be to have a functional Congress that will work to champion the best interests of the country. In the current culture, fundraising is more important than commitment, competence, results or patriotism. Candidates for Congress spent $8.7 billion on the 2020 election which was 500% more than 2000. The reason for that spending is logical, but dangerous - in 2020, 88% of Congressional races were won by the biggest spender. On average, less than 10% of those needed campaign funds come from small donors. The rest is from big donors that want something in return. The party wants loyalty; straight party line votes are not organic. Corporations want favorable legislation. Charles Koch and George Soros have their own wish lists. In addition to this omnipresent quid pro quo, Members of Congress also spend an unbelievable amount of time fund raising. Most spend around 50% of their time raising money for their own campaigns and for their party. Many freshman members are surprised – maybe shocked – to be criticized by their party for sitting through long Congressional Hearings instead of manning the fundraising phone banks. Governing becomes a part-time job. No wonder Congress’ average 2020 approval rating was in the low 20’s. I’m afraid term limit proposals just distract us from the real problem and allow politicians to wrongly look like reformers. Doug Broberg Fishers I just finished reading “Surviving Autocracy”, by Masha Gessem, written in April 2020. She had a Soviet childhood and two decades covering the resurgence of totalitarianism of Putin’s Russia, and compares this to Trump’s autocratic attempt, which is ongoing. She quotes the Hungarian Balint Magyar and the recent collapse of Hungarian democracy. Magyar coined the term “mafia state,” a clan-like system in which one man distributes money and power to all other members. Sound familiar? Gessem described Twitter as way of placing the lie and the truth side by side, as though the facts were a matter of debate. But, as we all saw on Jan. 6, 2021, tweets and fiery rhetoric have consequences. Trump’s campaign promise of a return to the imaginary past (MAGA) is largely a promise to transport Americans to a time when racism, misogyny, and xenophobia were mainstream attitudes, and 40% of Americans still buy into this. In April 2020, Gessem predicted a massive and possibly violent backlash after the November election, which did happen on Jan 6th. She said Americans will have to do more than vote, and more than campaign. We will have to understand anew why institutions exist. Trump preys on fear, weaponizes hatred, and fills the void left by the lack of vision. We must recall what undergirds the Congress and the courts, the media and civil society, and the belief that this can be a country of ALL its people. Trump’s threat of autocracy is not over.

81,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/04/27/congress-immigration-children-families-border/8931619491499/,"April 27 (UPI) -- Congress on Tuesday heard testimony from experts about how the United States can better handle unaccompanied migrant children at the border, following an influx of arrivals this year. The hearing titled ""Unaccompanied Children at the Border: Stakeholder Perspectives on the Way Forward"" sought to give the members of the homeland security subcommittee on border security, facilitation and operations the opportunity to ""examine suggestions for improving our system for unaccompanied children.""
Advertisement Last month, thousands of unaccompanied minors were reported to be under federal care, with many being held at U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities beyond the 72-hour limit set by federal law. In her opening statement, subcommittee Chairwoman Nanette Barragan, D-Calif., said that while the increased number of child migrants is ""a challenge,"" the United States must provide them the protections guaranteed under law.
RELATED House passes two bills in response to Trump 2017 travel ban ""The law requires that we treat unaccompanied children humanely and allows children to apply for asylum. It is simply the right thing to do, legally and morally,"" she said. Barragan specifically highlighted Title 42 of the U.S. Code which gives federal health officials emergency powers to limit transmission of infectious disease, including the ability to limit immigration from countries that pose a risk to public health and the Migrant Protection Protocols or ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as they wait for their claims to be processed as particularly harmful policies instituted by the former administration.
Advertisement Witness Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at The American Immigration Council, testified that these policies ""fundamentally did not work"" and placed children and families at risk of kidnapping and human trafficking.
RELATED Biden administration to make 22K more seasonal worker visas available ""In effect, under MPP and as well under Title 42 families are being turned over into the hands of cartels and pushed into desperation,"" he said President Joe Biden rolled back both policies shortly after taking office but left some portions in place, with data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection last month showing that expulsions under Title 42 increased 12.2% from January. Ranking member of the subcommittee Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., countered that Biden's immigration policies have drawn more migrants to the United States, calling for MPP and asylum cooperative agreements to be reinstated.
RELATED Cuba's economic woes may fuel America's next migrant crisis ""The administration's campaign statements coupled with what I believe to be an overzealous renunciation of the prior administration's border policies, which had proven to be effective ultimately ... have invited this activity to our borders,"" he said. Higgins said Biden's decision to halt construction of the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border launched by Trump was ""a major error."" In response to a question from Higgins, Lora Ries, director at the Center for Technology Policy and senior research fellow for homeland security at The Heritage Foundation, said that construction of the border wall already allocated by Congress should continue.
Advertisement ""As border control agents have said, they need three things: They need personnel, they need technology and they need infrastructure and the wall system, it's part of that. It's not just the wall, it's the access roads, it's the cameras, etc. is a key part of that. It buys them time, it gives them awareness of what's happening on the border,"" she said. Biden's administration responded to the influx of unaccompanied children by directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to process lone minors arriving at the southwestern border and approving requests to house unaccompanied minors at military bases. Federal officials on Thursday also opened a temporary shelter to house up to 1,000 unaccompanied minors between the ages of 5 and 17 at any time through Aug. 2 at the Long Beach Convention Center in California. Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia testified that while he is happy to offer the convention center to accommodate unaccompanied migrants, such facilities should not stand as a replacement for immigration reform. ""I want to be very clear, these facilities should be temporary and the goal should be quick family reunification,"" he said. Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense, testified that CBP should hire child welfare professionals to care for and screen the children received at the border and for health and human services officials to be co-located in facilities where children are being held and screened.
Advertisement ""We want to make sure that we have trained professionals engaging with them and so we can get our law enforcement agents back out doing law enforcement work and not taking care of children,"" she said. Earlier this month, attorneys tasked with reuniting hundreds of migrant families, who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under Trump administration immigration policies, said they located 61 parents but still had 445 children for whom they could not find parents. Biden last month appointed Vice President Kamala Harris to meet with the leaders of Mexico and the northern triangle of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador in a bid to stem the flow of migration. On Monday, Harris met with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei in a virtual bilateral meeting, in which they pledged to address the ""root causes"" of migration. She is also scheduled to travel to Guatemala and Mexico in June.",2021-04-27 06:53:38,Immigration: House to examine systems handling unaccompanied migrant children at border,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

	more than 40 mass shootings across the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a National Rifle Association-backed challenge to a New York state gun control law—triggering new calls for Democrats to urgently ""expand the court."" Slate staff writer Mark Joseph Stern, who covers courts and the law, pointed out in a series of tweets Monday that ""this case is likely to pave the way to the Supreme Court declaring a constitutional right to concealed public carry, overriding many state and local restrictions on the ability to bear concealed arms in public."" ""Congress and the White House can prioritize court expansion, adding liberal justices to prevent the current six–three majority from eradicating gun safety laws. Or they can watch as the majority exacerbates the nation's epidemic of gun violence by imposing a vision of the Second Amendment that 
	data has indicated leads to more handgun-related homicides,"" Stern added in an article Monday. ""The choice has never been so clear. And the stakes can be measured in human lives. The potentially landmark case, 
	according to SCOTUSblog, ""will be argued in the fall, with a decision expected sometime next year."" The justices' decision to take up the case comes just weeks after President Joe Biden 
	announced six initial actions to begin tackling the nation's ""gun violence public health epidemic"" and signed an executive order to establish a 36-member commission that will analyze arguments for and against reforming the high court. Shortly after Biden's move to create a commission—which controversially includes George Mason University Law School professor and Federalist Society contributor Adam White—Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined with Reps. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), and Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) to introduce a bill to expand the court by four seats, bringing the total to 13. If passed, the Judiciary Act of 2021 would allow Biden to restore a left-leaning majority, depending on his appointments. After the court's announcement about the gun case, progressives reiterated support for expanding the nation's top court. Referencing recent shootings and demands for stricter gun laws at the federal level, Elie Mystal, The Nation's justice correspondent, wrote in late March that ""regardless of the outcome in Congress, the conservative-controlled Supreme Court will not allow us to have commonsense gun regulation, let alone any ambitious, progressive legislation to get guns off the streets, like they do in other countries that don't have mass shootings every other day."" Mystal continued: Sharing the piece in a pair of tweets Monday, Mystal wrote that ""Democrats COULD put 10 more justices on the court to STOP THIS MADNESS... but nooo, Democrats want to pass gun reform *legislation* as if there a chance in hell this Supreme Court would uphold anything coming out of the Biden administration."" Noting the impact of Biden's predecessor appointing three justices in his single term, Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon issued a warning to policymakers on Monday: ""Expand the court or let [former President] Donald Trump's justices make our mass shooting epidemic even worse."" This case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. Corlett, will address whether the state's denial of two men's applications for concealed-carry licenses for self-defense violated the Second Amendment. New York state law requires anyone who wants a license to carry a handgun outside their home to show a ""proper cause."" ""California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have similar laws,"" reported the New York Times, citing gun rights groups. ""Federal appeals courts have generally rejected challenges to such restrictions,"" including the 2nd Circuit in this case, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court.  ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Indiana University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list The FBI wants to hear from Hasidim, or “ultra-Orthodox” Jews. The Hate Crimes Unit said as much when it issued announcements – in both Yiddish and Hebrew – asking Jews to report antisemitic incidents in an outreach campaign launched in April 2021. The campaign follows highly visible antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in recent years, including the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which left 11 people dead. Hasidic Jews make up the overwhelming majority of Yiddish speakers in the U.S. They number about 320,000 adults, according to Matt Williams, director of the Orthodox Union for Communal Research. Outreach to this community poses distinctive challenges because Hasidic communities can be insular, often seeking to address issues from education to sexual assault without involving outsiders. As someone who has written about Jews and the FBI, I am not surprised that the FBI now wants to address antisemitism. But the FBI has a complicated history with Jews. It is a past that suggests the FBI has loved the idea of Judaism as a religion, but not necessarily American Jews themselves. Officially founded in 1935, the FBI was designed to take on domestic crime and surveillance. By the late 1940s, driven by Cold War ideals, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover bolstered an image of the U.S. as religious and moral as opposed to its enemy – an atheistic, immoral Soviet Union. Embracing Judaism as good, lawful and American was strategic. During his prepared remarks at a 1947 House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Hoover called communism an “evil work” and “a cause that is alien to the religion of Christ and Judaism.” He believed that the U.S. had a superior moral foundation – a religious one – and that communism was built on nothing but human iniquity. Claiming for the U.S. a “Judeo-Christian” heritage, as became popular in the 1950s, supported the Cold War cause in another way too. It subtly referred to both God and democracy, and implied that both were on the side of Americans. Instead of merely emphasizing Christianity, the phrase also allowed Hoover and others to tout what they perceived as the U.S.‘s religious tolerance and inclusiveness. Since many Christians imagined Judaism as a precursor to Christianity, Judaism could signal diversity and democracy without seeming foreign. In practice, this meant that references to Judaism were not about anything distinctively Jewish but rather about what people thought it shared with Christianity, like the Ten Commandments. But there was a complication to the FBI’s embrace of Judaism. By the 1950s, U.S. Jews had a long history with the political left, including support of the Socialist and Communist parties, which the FBI saw as threats. “Communists have been, still are, and always will be a menace to freedom, to democratic ideals, to the worship of God and to the American way of life,” Hoover told the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. FBI officials and records associated Jews with communism. An American Jewish Committee document from this period reported that the FBI estimated that 50% to 60% of U.S. communists were Jews. These accusations and investigations had sometimes devastating effects. The Jewish actor Philip Loeb died by suicide after he was blacklisted from Hollywood and investigated by the FBI and could no longer work to support his disabled son. He overdosed on barbiturates in a New York hotel room. Days later, the FBI cleared him of being a member of the Communist Party. Internal FBI workings also demonstrated assumptions about Jews and communism as well as strategic sympathy to anti-Jewish prejudice. When an informant told agent Jack Levine that all Jews were communists, Levine was instructed to keep it out of his written report so that the bias could not discredit the informant. It did not appear to concern the FBI that the bias meant the informant might not be truthful. The FBI today is hardly the same organization that it was during the Cold War, but its sympathies for Judaism do have historical resonance. In 1958, bombers dynamited The Temple, the synagogue of the oldest Jewish congregation in Atlanta. The blast killed no one but caused at least US$100,000 in damage. President Eisenhower told Hoover to send the FBI to investigate, and Hoover quickly complied, even though it may not have been under the FBI’s jurisdiction. Hoover saw the bombing as an attack on religion, and so it was an attack on the country. With this history in mind, Yiddish and Hebrew announcements soliciting information from Jewish religious communities should come as no surprise – especially because some antisemitic attacks in the U.S. have taken place in religious spaces. For many, the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh looks like an attack on America because it is an attack on Judaism, even on religion. Outreach to Hasidim – the American Jews who look the most religious – has become one way the FBI wants to stop those attacks. [Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture.

He grabs at a couple in particular, showing his sister, Teresa Thomas, and her teenage children, Tiera Agee and Demetrius Thomas. “On days like now, I’d be over there,” Hall said on a recent, sunny Friday evening. “My sister would be cooking.” Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of the shooting that took Hall’s three relatives and two other teens who were living with them at the time, Marcus Stokes and Lakeitha Stokes. The five victims were shot and killed inside the home they shared with the suspect along the 2800 block of North 12th Street, in the North Division neighborhood, on the Milwaukee’s north side. It was the second mass shooting Milwaukee experienced during a historically violent 2020, just two months after five people were shot and killed at the Molson Coors complex. The suspect in the 12th Street shooting, Christopher P. Stokes, who is related to several of the victims, has been charged with five counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Stokes, who has a history of domestic violence convictions dating to 2002, has pleaded not guilty, but a trial date has yet to be scheduled after Stokes underwent several mental health examinations. Hall is still mourning the loss of his family members. He said over the last year he has thrown little house parties in remembrance of them on their birthdays. He reminisces about playing basketball with his nephew, walking his niece to school and swimming with his sister as children. Waiting for the court case to proceed has been its own burden on Hall, who is eager for Stokes to be held accountable. “He’s a monster,” Hall said of Stokes. “He has no consideration for human life or for those who took him in as well. To me, he doesn’t deserve to live. We need a sentencing and we need it now. Justice must be served.” The one-year anniversary comes as homicides in the city remain at heightened levels in 2021. In an eight-day period starting April 18, at least 10 people, including three minors, were killed by gun violence, according to law enforcement. More: 'Time for very frank discussions': After tragic week, Milwaukee officials say young people must be steered away from dangerous behavior “Nobody is going to be able to stop this brutal violence but us,” Alds. Russell Stamper II and Khalif Rainey, who represent two north side districts hit hard by gun violence, said in a statement Friday. “We as a community need to come together and work to protect our neighborhoods from this brutality, or we run the risk of losing more of our precious children to gun violence. We are begging the community to work together on stopping this behavior.” Hall said he frequently visited his sister’s apartment on North 12th Street. He said his sister, Teresa, 41, was a “very lovable” mother. With a disability, she struggled to get around but would “give you her shirt off her back” as a guest in her home. Her daughter, Tiera, 16, wanted to be either an interior decorator or a fashion designer as an adult, Hall said. Her brother, Demetrius, 15, loved playing basketball and video games with friends. “Being around them, it meant a lot to me,” said Hall, 40. “They mean the world to me.” The family at one point took in Marcus, 19, and Lakeitha Stokes, 17 – siblings who were also related to the suspect – after both had nowhere else to go. Hall didn’t come to know them as well, but he said Marcus helped support the family with a job at a fast-food restaurant while Lakeitha attended school. The Journal Sentinel was unable to reach the family of Marcus and Lakeitha, but Hall said they were considered part of Teresa Thomas' family. On April 27, 2020, police were called to the home shortly before 1 p.m. after the suspect called 911 and said he “just massacred my whole family,” the criminal complaint said. When officers arrived, they found the suspect waiting for them on the front porch holding the only survivor of the shooting, a 3-year-old grandchild of Teresa Thomas, according to a recently released report from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office. Police estimated the shooting happened around 5 a.m. that morning, based on statements from neighbors who said they heard a “booming” noise during the overnight hours, the report said. By the time police arrived, the victims were cold to the touch. Court documents do not indicate a motive. “I never thought something like this would happen to someone like me, or someone like (Teresa Thomas),” Hall said. “She never did nothing wrong to nobody. The woman never even had a traffic ticket.” Meanwhile, the court case for the suspect, Christopher Stokes, 44, stalled for three months last year after the court found he lacked “substantial capacity to understand court proceedings,” online court records said. After Stokes received care from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, Milwaukee County Judge Michelle Havas reinstated the case last September. Stokes has so far entered a not guilty plea, but it appears likely that his mental health will continue as a focal point. Stokes has been evaluated by two doctors to determine if he qualifies for what’s called an NGI plea, not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. A defendant entering an NGI plea contends that at the time he committed a crime, a mental disease or defect prevented him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his action, or from conforming his conduct to the law. Stokes is scheduled to appear for another plea hearing June 2. In an interview with the Journal Sentinel on Monday, an attorney for Stokes, Nathan Opland-Dobs, did not rule out an NGI plea for his client.

Even worse it has become linked to masculinity, patriotism, and White power. We have a gun death rate in the U.S. that is a humiliating national embarassment, and yet the killings, the death, never seems to reach a level where it causes us as a nation to do anything about it. Too many Americans love guns more than they do other human beings. There have been at least 50 mass shootings in America since the massacre and apparent hate crime attack against Asian Americans in the Atlanta area on March 16. The COVID-19 pandemic has done nothing to stop America’s addiction to gun violence. Writing at the Nation, Tom Engelhardt explains, “In the first 73 days of Joe Biden’s presidency, there were five mass shootings and more than 10,000 gun-violence deaths. In the Covid-19 era, this has been the model the world’s ‘most exceptional’ nation (as American politicians of both parties used to love to call this country) has set for the rest of the planet. Put another way, so far in 2020 and 2021, there have been two pandemics in America, Covid-19 and guns.” Too many Americans love guns … There are plenty of Black folks with guns, just read/watch the news. What security forces surround Lindsay Graham?
Do we pay for them? No one should have a military grade weapon with more than one shot at a time, which is all that should be needed for any hunting; which I believe is an unnecessary endeavor in itself.",2021-04-27 05:35:00,"Gun crazy: For too many Americans, guns are tied to masculinity, patriotism and white power",,300516,http://www.schwartzreport.net/

90,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-secret-footage-of-nra-chief-wayne-lapierres-botched-elephant-hunt,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Mike Spies After the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in 2012, Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, told Americans agitating for new gun regulations, “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” Less than a year later, LaPierre and his wife, Susan, travelled to Botswana’s Okavango Delta, where they hoped to show N.R.A. members that they had the grit to take on a different adversary: African bush elephants, the largest land mammals on Earth. The trip was filmed by a crew from “Under Wild Skies,” an N.R.A.-sponsored television series that was meant to boost the organization’s profile among hunters—a key element of its donor base. But the program never aired, according to sources and records, because of concerns that it could turn into a public-relations fiasco. The Trace and The New Yorker obtained a copy of the footage, which has been hidden from public view for eight years. It shows that when guides tracked down an elephant for LaPierre, the N.R.A. chief proved to be a poor marksman. After LaPierre’s first shot wounded the elephant, guides brought him a short distance from the animal, which was lying on its side, immobilized. Firing from point-blank range, LaPierre shot the animal three times in the wrong place. Finally, a guide had the host of “Under Wild Skies” fire the shot that killed the elephant. Later that day, Susan LaPierre showed herself to be a better shot than her husband. After guides tracked down an elephant for her, Susan killed it, cut off its tail, and held it in the air. “Victory!” she shouted, laughing. “That’s my elephant tail. Way cool.” For three decades, LaPierre has led the N.R.A.’s fund-raising efforts by railing against out-of-touch “élites” and selling himself as an authentic champion of American self-reliance and the unfettered right to protect oneself with a gun. But the footage, as well as newly uncovered legal records, suggest that behind his carefully constructed Everyman image, LaPierre is a coddled executive who is clumsy with a firearm, and fearful of the violent political climate he has helped to create. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for comment. This story was published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit news organization covering guns in America. The N.R.A. is weathering an existential crisis, which began with revelations of rampant self-dealing first reported in 2019 and extends to an ongoing legal fight with the New York Attorney General and a humiliating bankruptcy trial. Now, the video and other materials offer a glimpse of the stage-managed, insular, and privileged life of the N.R.A.’s top official. The footage of LaPierre in Botswana first shows him walking through the bush dressed in loose-fitting safari attire and an NRA Sports baseball cap. He is accompanied by several professional guides and his longtime adviser, Tony Makris, a top executive at the N.R.A.’s former public-relations firm, Ackerman McQueen, and the host of “Under Wild Skies.” The heat, at times, causes LaPierre to sweat. As he walks, his wire-framed glasses slide down his nose. After a guide spots an elephant standing behind a tree, LaPierre takes aim with a rifle. As LaPierre peers through the weapon’s scope, the guide repeatedly tells him to wait before firing. LaPierre is wearing earplugs, doesn’t hear the instructions, and pulls the trigger. The elephant drops. “Did we get him?” LaPierre asks. The guide at first says yes, but then, as he approaches the elephant, it appears that the animal is still breathing. The guide brings LaPierre within a few strides of the elephant, which lays motionless on the ground. He tells LaPierre that another bullet is needed. “I’m going to show you where to shoot,” the guide says. “Listen, hold your rifle—I’m going to tell you when. Just hold it up.” The guide pushes the rifle’s barrel skyward as other men involved in the expedition move around in the distance. “I’m going to point for you where to shoot. Just waiting for these guys.” The guide walks over to the elephant, crouches down, and points near the animal’s ear, telling LaPierre to shoot the elephant there. Makris directs LaPierre to shoot low, accounting for the rifle scope. LaPierre fires and a confused expression comes over his face. Once again, he shoots the elephant in the wrong place. It’s still alive. The guide tells LaPierre to sit down and reminds him to reload, as he physically moves LaPierre into place. Now on one knee, the N.R.A. leader asks, “Same spot?” and then shoots again. The bullet misses the mark. “I don’t think it’s quite done yet,” the guide says to Makris. “Do you want to do it for him?” The guide then says to LaPierre, “I’m not sure where you’re shooting.” “Where are you telling me to shoot?” LaPierre responds, sounding frustrated. The guide again walks over to the elephant and points toward the ear. “Oh, O.K.,” LaPierre says. “All right, I can shoot there.” He takes a third shot at point-blank range. “Uh-uh,” the guide says, indicating that LaPierre has missed his mark again. “No?” LaPierre asks. As the guide chuckles, Makris asks, “Do you want me to do it?” “Go ahead, finish him,” the guide says. Makris cocks his rifle and shoots. “That’s it,” the guide declares, before turning to the N.R.A. chief to congratulate him. Makris, ignoring his own role, praises LaPierre’s marksmanship, “You dropped him like no tomorrow.” Later, LaPierre and the guide chat beside the dead elephant, a species that was declared endangered earlier this year. LaPierre acknowledges that his initial shot wasn’t “perfect.” The guide encourages him. “He went down, so that’s what counts.” Looking sheepish, LaPierre lets out a laugh and says, “Maybe I had a little luck.” Over the course of LaPierre’s tenure at the N.R.A., Makris was one of his two most important advisers. The other was the late Angus McQueen, who, until he died, in 2019, ran the firm that bore his name. For forty years, Ackerman McQueen devised combative messaging campaigns that successfully placed the N.R.A. at the forefront of the culture wars. The once-close relationships unravelled in a series of bitter legal battles over contracts, unpaid bills, and allegations of deceptive business practices. In September, 2019, LaPierre sat for a private deposition in one of the cases involving Ackerman McQueen. Although the document remains sealed, The Trace and The New Yorker reviewed a copy. In his sworn testimony, LaPierre’s manner is inconsistent with the swaggering, confrontational public persona he has cultivated for decades. When asked about lavish spending, he pleaded ignorance or blamed his advisers. LaPierre’s life style, as described in the deposition, is a stark contrast from the Americans the N.R.A. claims to represent. Lawyers pressed LaPierre about nearly three hundred thousand dollars in payments that Ackerman McQueen made to Ermenegildo Zegna, a luxury men’s fashion retailer on Rodeo Drive, in Beverly Hills, to dress LaPierre between 2004 and 2017. According to an N.R.A. ad, the group’s coalition includes “steelworkers,” “cowboys,” “hard-rock miners,” “swamp folks in Cajun country who can wrestle a full-grown gator out of the water,” “the mountain men who live off the land,” and “the brave cops who fight the good fight in the urban war zones.” When a lawyer for Ackerman McQueen asked LaPierre about the upscale suits, he said, “Angus told me, ‘Wayne, get wardrobe. Go get wardrobe.’ Angus actually set up the billing.” The lawyer replied, “But, let me just say, you’re a big boy, right?” “Yes.” “You can make your own decisions about what clothes you need and what clothes you don’t need,” the lawyer said. “You’ve been dressing yourself for a number of years.” LaPierre then defended the purchases, arguing that he was the N.R.A.’s “primary brand spokesperson” and that he “didn’t see anything wrong with it” since his job required “looking good on TV in terms of your image.” He said that McQueen recommended certain types of suits. “There was a period where Angus wanted me in light suits because he thought that women responded better in light suits. There was another period of time where he thought my suits were outdated because style—style had changed.” LaPierre said that he called McQueen “Yoda,” after the “Star Wars” character that serves as a symbol of unparalleled wisdom. “I thought that from a branding and imaging and crisis management skill,” LaPierre elaborated, “I thought that he had a certain amount of exceptional, unique, genius quality.” At another point in the deposition, an attorney asked LaPierre if he ever wore the suits to non-N.R.A. events. “I hardly ever—I don’t really put on a suit except when I have to for N.R.A. work,” he said. “I get so harassed. The minute I put on a suit, I get I.D.’ed and somebody starts yelling at me.” LaPierre then became emotional. “So to tell you the honest truth,” he said, “I’m walking around most of the time—almost all the time in jeans and sunglasses and a ball cap because I am sick and my family is sick and tired of being yelled at, shouted at, screamed at, harassed, swatted, hacked, and generally abused.” Lawyers also asked about spending related to Susan LaPierre. An unpaid volunteer at the N.R.A., she is one of the organization’s most visible fund-raisers. Susan co-chairs the Women’s Leadership Forum, a program designed to reward and cultivate high-dollar female donors. Though she doesn’t draw a salary, full-time N.R.A. employees work on her projects, and the organization also provides her with ample resources. At a 2015 fund-raising luncheon, for example, records show that the organization paid the country band Rascal Flatts three hundred and fifteen thousand dollars to play a half-hour acoustic set. The deposition reveals, for the first time, the name of a makeup artist, Brady Wardlaw, who was hired in May and September of 2016, for an N.R.A. convention in Louisville, Kentucky, and a retreat in McLean, Virginia. Wardlaw is based in Nashville, and his clients have included Taylor Swift, LeAnn Rimes, and other country music stars. Bills for the makeup services for the events amounted to seventeen thousand dollars. In response to questions from lawyers, LaPierre stated that he wasn’t sure whether Susan specifically requested Wardlaw for the events. He claimed that Ackerman McQueen “recommended the makeup” and that his wife, “who is a complete volunteer,” was not the only woman at the events who received Wardlaw’s services. When Susan later learned the cost of the makeup, LaPierre asserted, she put a stop to it. It is important to the N.R.A. that supporters view Susan as a genuine member of the hunting and outdoor community. During the bankruptcy trial, LaPierre testified that his wife’s attendance on the Botswana trip was “part of projecting her image for the N.R.A.” Internally, some N.R.A. employees derided the Women’s Leadership Forum as the “Susan LaPierre Life Legacy Project.” In the video footage from Botswana, Susan’s hair is pulled back in a ponytail, her nails are manicured, and her large stud earrings sparkle in the sun. She walks through the dry vegetation, until two elephants come into view and a guide sets up a stand that Susan uses to steady her rifle. The elephant in front stares directly at Susan and the guide. “O.K., you want to do a front or you want to do a side?” the guide whispers. “Which one do you feel more comfortable with?” “Well, right now I’ve got him right in the front,” she says. The guide tells her to aim for a crease between the elephant’s eyes. When she fires, the bullet enters the creature’s head, its trunk immediately flops toward the sky, and it collapses onto its belly before rolling onto its side. The elephant appears to be dead, but Susan, from closer range and at the guide’s direction, fires one more bullet in its chest “for insurance.” “That was amazing,” Susan says, patting her chest. “Wow. My heart is racing. I feel great.” She walks over to the elephant. “That was awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.” She inspects the elephant, bends at the waist, and seems to think the elephant is still alive. “Aww, he’s still there. Look at his eyes.” She places her hand on her chest, laughs, walks around the elephant, and pats one of its tusks. “Beautiful animal,” she says, and then, speaking to the elephant, “You’re a good old guy. A real good old guy.” She grows emotional and appears to choke up, then asks a guide about the elephant’s age.“Must be close to fifty years old, I would say,” the guide says. “You think so?” she asks. “That’s exactly what I wanted. An old bull. Near the end of his age.” The guide tells her she’s allowed to cry. “What an experience this is,” she says. “Once in a lifetime.” She rests a hand on the elephant’s forehead. “I was practicing this shot all day long.” She laughs again. “He wasn’t sure what we were doing. Amazing. That’s just incredible. Quite a day. Two beautiful African elephant in one day.” Susan touches the animal’s feet. “He’s so wrinkly. . . . Wow. A podiatrist would love working on him.” Soon, Wayne enters the frame. He hugs his wife, congratulates her, and says, “I’m proud of you. That is really neat.” A person off-camera asks Susan if the elephant looked like it was going to charge her, and she says no, but that the animal “was checking us out.” Wayne responds, “But if he was looking at you like that, he could’ve charged.” Later, a guide invites Susan to cut off the elephant’s tail, a ritual he says hunters performed in the “olden days” to claim their animal. Susan hesitates, but begins cutting the tail with a knife. “Oh, it’s like a fish almost, with the center cartilage,” she says. Once the tail is off, she raises it in the air, and stretches out her arms, the bloody knife in one hand and the tail in the other. “Here in Botswana, in the Okavango Delta, with ‘Under Wild Skies,’ ” she says, and then laughs again. Hunts in Botswana can cost tens of thousands of dollars per person, and, according to testimony in the bankruptcy case, a company that belongs to Makris covered the LaPierres’ costs. After the trip, in late September of 2013, footage of Makris shooting an elephant on a different expedition aired on NBC Sports, which then hosted “Under Wild Skies.” The  episode caused an immediate public backlash. The footage of the LaPierre hunt never aired, but records show that the couple still wanted their trophies. To avoid bad publicity—and at Susan’s written request—body parts from both elephants were shipped to the U.S. in a hidden manner. A man travelled two hours to Johannesburg to remove the couple’s names from shipping crates. The Master Airway Bill was in the name of a taxidermist, whom Makris’s company paid to turn the animals’ front feet into stools for Wayne and Susan’s home.

91,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/7H9NCoq5NZw/,"Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt drew a connection between mass shootings and Tucker Carlson of the Fox News Channel, arguing Tuesday that the “replacement” theory espoused by gunmen is shared by Carlson on his show. As Breitbart News noted earlier this month, Greenblatt demanded that Fox News fire Carlson for arguing that Democrats are lenient towards illegal immigration partly because they want to change the existing U.S. electorate by adding new voters. Greenblatt accused Carlson of espousing a white supremacist conspiracy theory, which holds falsely that such “replacement” is orchestrated by Jews. But Carlson did not endorse that idea. He also quoted Democrats describing their strategy candidly. In a new op-ed at the Times of Israel that cites the Anti-Defamation League’s annual survey of antisemitism in the U.S., Greenblatt draws a connection between mass shootings in recent years and Carlson’s more recent remarks (emphasis added): And, just as the wildfires that have devastated the West Coast in recent years were predicted by decades of scientific data, the mass shootings in Poway, El Paso, and Atlanta came after ADL and others had elevated the indisputable evidence of amplifying intolerance, hatred and extremism. Today, we released our annual Audit of Antisemitic Incidents for the 2020 calendar year, a report we have published for more than four decades. Disturbingly, 2020 joins 2019, 2018, and 2017 as four of the five worst years in the more than 40 years that ADL has been collecting this information. But is this really a surprise when one can turn on a major news network and see the replacement theory espoused in primetime to millions of viewers? Or log on to the largest social media service and be recruited by the Proud Boys? And, although our audit encompasses mostly incidents of harassment, vandalism, and assault perpetrated by individuals who are not extremists, the evidence we have compiled suggests that the climate of acceptable discourse toward Jews has worsened considerably in recent years and, as we have seen throughout history, hatred that targets Jews typically targets other marginalized groups too. The mass shooting in Atlanta, cited by Greenblatt above, has no known connection to extremism; though most of the victims were Asian, the shooter appeared to have targeted the victims at local massage parlors because of his sexual compulsions.

92,https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/alley-cat-allies-investigates-brutal-cat-massacre-by-australian-port-15637491," BETHESDA, Md., April 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Alley Cat Allies has launched a special investigation into a ghastly mass-shooting of feral cats, also called community cats, directed by the Port of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, that left at least 12 cats dead, maimed or missing. Becky Robinson, the president and founder of Alley Cat Allies, is calling on the Port's leadership to immediately end all killing and instead embrace humane, nonlethal management practices for cats.    ""The Newcastle Port Authority called this a 'cull,' but there is no whitewashing the fact that this was a massacre, plain and simple,"" Robinson said. ""Cats are sentient creatures who feel pain, and the cats who were the victims of this late-night hunt by the Port Authority endured horrific injuries and tremendous suffering. Killing cats does not have a rightful place in conservation strategy. The Port Authority must stop shooting and killing cats and needs to make a public commitment that it will never happen again. We demand that they adopt sane, humane, effective methods centered on spay and neuter, also known as desexing."" Alley Cat Allies, in collaboration with supporters in Australia and the Animal Justice Party of Australia, learned that the Newcastle Port Authority hired a contract killer to hunt down and shoot sterilized cats at the Stockton Breakwall, a public beach jetty, in December 2020. The next morning, devastated caregivers for the cats discovered a bloody, disturbing scene. One cat, Rosie, was shot in the eye. The attack left another cat, Lily, blind and with a hernia. As many as eight cats are missing and presumed killed. Some surviving cats still suffer from their gunshot wounds as caregivers scramble to trap them. The caregivers and local veterinarians have grave concerns that these powerless, wounded cats remain in danger. The Port Authority's attack came despite the fact that the cats were sterilized, vaccinated and cared for through a Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) program practiced by compassionate caregivers. TNR successfully reduced the number of cats at the Port from 100 to approximately 40 in recent years. These caregivers were neither warned about the hunt nor told that the Port took issue with community cats in the area to begin with. Killing cats is not an effective means of population control because of a well-documented scientific phenomenon known as the Vacuum Effect. When cats are killed, new cats move in to take their place. ""The Port's actions serve as a reminder that in far too many places around the world, including in Australia and the United States, there persists an archaic mindset that killing cats is viable and necessary,"" Robinson continued. ""Humane, nonlethal sterilization is being utilized all over the globe because it works. Killing does not work. The Newcastle Port Authority needs to wake up to the reality that hunting cats is not acceptable and join the rest of civilized society with a lifesaving policy for its cats."" The Alley Cat Allies investigation has prompted international condemnation of the Newcastle Port Authority's actions. Alley Cat Allies has posted a short documentary film with the findings from its investigation at alleycat.org/StocktonBreakwallCats, where it will continue to post more information from the case as it becomes available.

93,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/some-of-other-hateful-rhetoric-santorum-peddled-since-joining-cnn,"Former Republican Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, having lost his second presidential bid in 2016, joined CNN as a senior political commentator in early 2017. Now CNN is being slammed with calls to fire Santorum for whitewashing the genocide of Native Americans during a speech at a conservative event last week. The network has yet to respond to the blowback. But before Santorum was claiming European colonizers built America out of “nothing” and that Native Americans haven’t contributed anything to American culture, he offered plenty of awful (and fact-free) takes on race, school shootings and victims of sexual assault: Santorum’s response to the wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers across the country and the vandalization of dozens of Jewish tombstones in February 2017 was to accuse Muslims of anti-Semitism, even though there was no evidence that Muslims were responsible for those incidents. “If you look at the fact of the people who are responsible for a lot of this anti-Semitism that we’re seeing, a lot of it is coming from the pro-Palestinian, or Muslim community,” he told CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. Santorum also wrung his hands over what he claimed to be “the role that Muslims are playing on college campuses to stifle opposition voices.” Arguably one of Santorum’s most egregious moments as a commentator was when he went after student protesters, including school shooting victims, who were demanding that lawmakers implement gun control after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018. “How about kids, instead of looking to someone else to solve their problem, do something about maybe taking CPR classes or trying to deal with situations that — where there is a violent shooter and actually respond to that,” said Santorum, who raked in $115,942 from the National Rifle Association (NRA) during his 16 years in Congress, according to Politico. When fellow CNN contributor Van Jones talked about how Black Americans like himself and his family were hurting in wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin last summer, Santorum offered an astonishingly racist take on where Black people’s fears “really should be.” “The reality is that your son has, unfortunately, a better chance of being shot by someone in a neighborhood, in a criminal event, than he does by a police officer. And it’s not even close,” he told Jones. Santorum boosted conservatives’ smear campaign against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she alleged in 2018 that Trump’s then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teens. The CNN contributor accused Blasey Ford of “complicity” with Democrats and baselessly claimed that she “obviously came forward because she wanted to have an impact on” Kavanaugh’s nomination. “You don’t share this unless you’re trying to influence the political process. You don’t come forward unless you’re doing so because you want to influence this process,” Santorum said, exemplifying the reason many victims of sexual violence don’t come forward: Fear that powerful people like Santorum will drag their names through the mud and accuse them of having ulterior motives. During a roundtable discussion with CNN anchor Dana Bash in 2018, Santorum tried to blame former President Barack Obama for the rise of Trump-era racism that led to the deadly Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally. “What is being ignored here is the role that Barack Obama played into all this,” he said. Santorum claimed that “many, many, many people saw” Obama “doing more to exacerbate racism in this country,” and falsely argued that the former president sided against the police “[e]very time there was a controversy where someone of color was involved.” In fact, Obama was often supportive of police throughout his presidency — he cut his trip to a NATO Summit in Europe short to fly to Dallas and give a memorial speech in honor of the five police officers who were killed by a sniper in 2016. He notably did not make similar trips to Minneapolis and Baton Rouge after the police killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling that year. During CNN’s panel on Trump’s State of the Union address in 2018, Santorum defended Trump’s racist characterization of “Dreamers,” undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. “Some Dreamers are gang members,” the Republican said before mocking the idea of calling them “Dreamers” in the first place. “First off, the idea that all Dreamers are, quote ‘Dreamers,’ is ridiculous,” he said. “There are Dreamers who are not dreamers. There are Dreamers who are not doing well. There are Dreamers who are criminals.” Two California men have been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly plotting to attack the Democratic Party headquarters… An Arizona judge on Thursday denied Republican senators’ motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking records on the financial backers and… Lin Wood started the week claiming that he wasn’t subject to the jurisdiction of a Michigan federal judge considering whether… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

94,https://www.alternet.org/2021/04/wayne-lapierre-2652801230/,"For 40 years Wayne LaPierre has been the executive vice president and CEO of the National Rifle Association, and yet can't seem to shoot straight. A just-published article at The New Yorker exposes the top gun lobby group's chief as having ""clumsy marksmanship,"" as a video of him on safari with his wife (below) reveals. ""After the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in 2012, Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, told Americans agitating for new gun regulations, 'The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.' Less than a year later, LaPierre and his wife, Susan, travelled to Botswana's Okavango Delta, where they hoped to show N.R.A. members that they had the grit to take on a different adversary: African bush elephants, the largest land mammals on Earth. The trip was filmed by a crew from 'Under Wild Skies,' an N.R.A.-sponsored television series that was meant to boost the organization's profile among hunters—a key element of its donor base. But the program never aired,"" The New Yorker's Mike Spies writes. ""The Trace and The New Yorker obtained a copy of the footage, which has been hidden from public view for eight years. It shows that when guides tracked down an elephant for LaPierre, the N.R.A. chief proved to be a poor marksman. After LaPierre's first shot wounded the elephant, guides brought him a short distance from the animal, which was lying on its side, immobilized. Firing from point-blank range, LaPierre shot the animal three times in the wrong place. Finally, a guide had the host of 'Under Wild Skies' fire the shot that killed the elephant. Later that day, Susan LaPierre showed herself to be a better shot than her husband. After guides tracked down an elephant for her, Susan killed it, cut off its tail, and held it in the air. 'Victory!' she shouted, laughing. 'That's my elephant tail. Way cool.'"" Journalist Yashar Ali, has exposed top media and personalities and politicians, including former Fox News host Eric Bolling, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, Lincoln Project co-founder John Weaver, and TV personality Sharon Osbourne. He is an avid elephant rights activist and posted The New Yorker's video, along with some commentary. ""Because they are cowards, Wayne and Susan LaPierre had parts from the two elephants they killed shipped to the United States under a taxidermists name instead of theirs,"" He writes in one tweet. ""The elephants front feet were turned into stools for the LaPierre's home."" Caution: graphic and disturbing content: The details of the killing of the elephant are brutal, clearly the animal must have suffered greatly. ""After a guide spots an elephant standing behind a tree, LaPierre takes aim with a rifle. As LaPierre peers through the weapon's scope, the guide repeatedly tells him to wait before firing. LaPierre is wearing earplugs, doesn't hear the instructions, and pulls the trigger. The elephant drops. 'Did we get him?' LaPierre asks."" Elephants are considered to be very intelligent, self-aware, and show empathy. Scientific American in 2014 reported they are ""some of the most intelligent, social and empathic animals around.""

95,https://www.alternet.org/2021/04/fbi-judaism/,"Nashville bomber was not a terrorist, but motivated by suicide: FBI by Sarah Imhoff, Indiana University The FBI wants to hear from Hasidim, or “ultra-Orthodox"" Jews. The Hate Crimes Unit said as much when it issued announcements – in both Yiddish and Hebrew – asking Jews to report antisemitic incidents in an outreach campaign launched in April 2021. The campaign follows highly visible antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in recent years, including the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which left 11 people dead. Hasidic Jews make up the overwhelming majority of Yiddish speakers in the U.S. They number about 320,000 adults, according to Matt Williams, director of the Orthodox Union for Communal Research. Outreach to this community poses distinctive challenges because Hasidic communities can be insular, often seeking to address issues from education to sexual assault without involving outsiders. As someone who has written about Jews and the FBI, I am not surprised that the FBI now wants to address antisemitism. But the FBI has a complicated history with Jews. It is a past that suggests the FBI has loved the idea of Judaism as a religion, but not necessarily American Jews themselves. Officially founded in 1935, the FBI was designed to take on domestic crime and surveillance. By the late 1940s, driven by Cold War ideals, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover bolstered an image of the U.S. as religious and moral as opposed to its enemy – an atheistic, immoral Soviet Union. Embracing Judaism as good, lawful and American was strategic. During his prepared remarks at a 1947 House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Hoover called communism an “evil work"" and “a cause that is alien to the religion of Christ and Judaism."" He believed that the U.S. had a superior moral foundation – a religious one – and that communism was built on nothing but human iniquity. Claiming for the U.S. a “Judeo-Christian"" heritage, as became popular in the 1950s, supported the Cold War cause in another way too. It subtly referred to both God and democracy, and implied that both were on the side of Americans. Instead of merely emphasizing Christianity, the phrase also allowed Hoover and others to tout what they perceived as the U.S.'s religious tolerance and inclusiveness. Since many Christians imagined Judaism as a precursor to Christianity, Judaism could signal diversity and democracy without seeming foreign. In practice, this meant that references to Judaism were not about anything distinctively Jewish but rather about what people thought it shared with Christianity, like the Ten Commandments. But there was a complication to the FBI's embrace of Judaism. By the 1950s, U.S. Jews had a long history with the political left, including support of the Socialist and Communist parties, which the FBI saw as threats. “Communists have been, still are, and always will be a menace to freedom, to democratic ideals, to the worship of God and to the American way of life,"" Hoover told the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. FBI officials and records associated Jews with communism. An American Jewish Committee document from this period reported that the FBI estimated that 50% to 60% of U.S. communists were Jews. These accusations and investigations had sometimes devastating effects. The Jewish actor Philip Loeb died by suicide after he was blacklisted from Hollywood and investigated by the FBI and could no longer work to support his disabled son. He overdosed on barbiturates in a New York hotel room. Days later, the FBI cleared him of being a member of the Communist Party. Internal FBI workings also demonstrated assumptions about Jews and communism as well as strategic sympathy to anti-Jewish prejudice. When an informant told agent Jack Levine that all Jews were communists, Levine was instructed to keep it out of his written report so that the bias could not discredit the informant. It did not appear to concern the FBI that the bias meant the informant might not be truthful. The FBI today is hardly the same organization that it was during the Cold War, but its sympathies for Judaism do have historical resonance. In 1958, bombers dynamited The Temple, the synagogue of the oldest Jewish congregation in Atlanta. The blast killed no one but caused at least US$100,000 in damage. President Eisenhower told Hoover to send the FBI to investigate, and Hoover quickly complied, even though it may not have been under the FBI's jurisdiction. Hoover saw the bombing as an attack on religion, and so it was an attack on the country. With this history in mind, Yiddish and Hebrew announcements soliciting information from Jewish religious communities should come as no surprise – especially because some antisemitic attacks in the U.S. have taken place in religious spaces. For many, the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh looks like an attack on America because it is an attack on Judaism, even on religion. Outreach to Hasidim – the American Jews who look the most religious – has become one way the FBI wants to stop those attacks. [Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture.

One person was killed, another is in critical condition,"" WRIC-TV reports. ""The victims have been identified as two adult women, two teenage girls, and a three-month-old girl. The three-month-old is said to be in critical condition,"" the station reported. ""Police say the person killed was one of the two adult women. The rest of the people shot were hospitalized, two have non-life threatening injuries and two have life-threatening injuries."" Richmond Police Chief Gerald Smith described it as a ""heinous act."" ""Gunmen appeared in one of the breezeways and opened fire,"" said Smith. ""It appears that they were targeting a particular apartment, not necessarily people or individuals, but they had no regard for the individuals that were out there."" ""At this time, the Richmond Police Department, parents and loved ones, would ask that anyone who knows anything to please give us a call right away because we know someone out here knows what happened, and what took place, and what the motives were, and who the shooters were,"" Smith said.

As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox.

While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.

98,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/grief-must-be-witnessed-joe-biden-s-first-100-days-n1265167," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News WASHINGTON — Joe Biden wanted a vacation. Instead, he got another funeral. It was May of last year. Biden had recently secured the Democratic presidential nomination, and he wanted to take some time off the virtual campaign trail to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau. But then George Floyd was killed, the country exploded into a racial reckoning, and the man who has been dubbed ""America's Grief Counselor,"" the ""Emissary of Grief"" and the ""Designated Mourner"" felt compelled, once again, to eulogize. ""Unlike most, you must grieve in public,"" Biden told Floyd's family at the funeral. ""And it's a burden. A burden that is now your purpose."" Public grieving has been Biden's burden and purpose since he was first sworn into the Senate from a podium erected next to the hospital bed where his sons were convalescing from the car accident that had killed their mother and sister. And it's the burden Biden now carries for the nation 100 days into being president of a country that has lost more than 570,000 people to a pandemic while martyrizing people like Floyd. ""Grief must be witnessed,"" said David Kessler, a grief expert and author who runs Grief.com and has himself received a condolence call from Biden. ""I often talk about how we're a grief-illiterate society. But we certainly have a leader who knows grief."" Many of the public rituals of grief were impossible to observe during the pandemic. Families couldn't gather. Houses of worship were closed. Bodies of loved ones were deemed to be biohazards that had to be disposed of quickly. And Biden's predecessor showed no interest in performing even the most basic consolations expected of every president. Kristin Urquiza, who after speaking at the Democratic National Convention about her father's death from Covid-19 formed a group to work with and advocate for people touched by the virus, said many who lost loved ones felt former President Donald Trump was ""gaslighting"" them and denying their grief by downplaying the severity of the pandemic. ""It's been very meaningful for our community to have the president acknowledge that this is happening, this is real, and to do events and take time to recognize this loss,"" she said of Biden. ""We have all been on this tragic journey for months and months and months where we haven't been able to collectively grieve."" Grief has defined Biden's public life and public image since the story of the young senator's postcard-perfect family's being ripped apart made national news shortly after his election in 1972. And he has become both a student and a master of thanatology, the grim field of study named for the Greek god of death. Biden kept a binder filled with the dozens of eulogies he has delivered, quotations about death he likes or little axioms and anecdotes he had collected along the way. He weeps in public, speaks often about his personal losses and remembers the death anniversaries of people close to people he knows, and he has been known to appear at a wake or a shiva gathering or a funeral unannounced and without fanfare. ""His empathy is real, it's authentic — and it's something he is able to deploy at will like a master craft person,"" said Arun Chaudhary, who was the Obama White House videographer. Chaudhary can still recall verbatim part of the eulogy Biden gave for the 29 coal miners killed in the Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia in 2010: ""They went into the dark so we could go into the light."" ""I filmed thousands of speeches, hundreds of Joe Biden speeches and thousands of Barack Obama speeches, and I can still remember this all these years later,"" he said. Biden wrote a book about grief, ""Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose,"" about Beau, the family's golden child — decorated soldier, attorney general of Delaware, the one who Biden said should be president instead — who died of a brain tumor in 2015. At Beau's funeral, the Rev. Leo O'Donovan, the former president of Georgetown University, who was giving the homily, erupted in tears almost immediately after he started. ""He began to comfort me,"" O'Donovan revealed to the National Catholic Reporter about Biden. ""He became the pastor there."" Even before the pandemic, when Biden would linger on the rope line at events, sometimes every fourth or fifth person he met would share a story of loss. Some would leave their fleeting encounters with tears in their eyes or feelings of being unburdened, at least for a moment. At a televised town hall in March 2020, he nearly gave out his cellphone number live on the air to someone grieving before he stopped himself. ""Not that I'm an expert, but just having been there, I'm so sorry for you,"" he said. The night before his inauguration, Biden held a Covid-19 memorial service instead of a party and used his first major address from the White House to commemorate the anniversary of the pandemic. He carries in his pocket, on the back of the day's agenda, the virus's latest death toll. And his administration has made public funds available to help with funeral costs. Beyond the pandemic, he has called the families of those killed by law enforcement officers, including Floyd's, and met with people touched by mass shootings, like the one in the Atlanta area that appeared to target Asian Americans. ""[We] didn't really talk about hate crime sentencing and all of these things there's been a lot of discussion around. We really talked about the grief people are feeling,"" Georgia state Rep. Marvin Lim told The Associated Press about his meeting with Biden. Michael Wear, who led faith outreach efforts for Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, said: ""In a previous political era, Biden's acquaintance with grief could have quite reasonably been identified as a negative. Do the American people really want a man who will cry in public at the thought of his children? For Biden, the culture has sort of caught up with his grief."" In this moment, empathy is Biden's ""superpower,"" his advisers have often said. ""We always heard people talk about Biden, even if they didn't like that he was a Democrat or didn't necessarily like all of his policies, one thing that connected them to him is his personality — is that he's compassionate, is that he's empathetic,"" said Biden's chief campaign pollster, John Anzalone. ""I remember people multiple times saying, 'He has lived my life.' And part of that was the tragedies that he had gone through."" It's an ability only someone with Biden's story could have, said Massimo Faggioli, a professor of theology at Villanova University, who wrote a spiritual biography of Biden's Catholic faith published in January. It's not just the loss; it's his status as a living, breathing example that people can not just endure but ""get up, get up, get up,"" as Biden often ended his stump speeches, and go on to do great things after great loss. ""He's not selling talking points. He's selling his experience, his soul,"" Faggioli said. ""He has digested tragedy without becoming dark or inward-looking. That is something like a miracle from a human point of view. And it's also a political miracle, because he became president much, much later than anyone would have expected he possibly could."" Many presidents have been called upon to act as consoler-in-chief; some of the most memorable moments in the American presidency have come in memoriam. Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address at the commemoration of a cemetery at the battleground. Franklin D. Roosevelt marking ""a date which will live in infamy"" after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Bill Clinton telling people he could ""feel their pain."" George W. Bush speaking with the megaphone on the smoldering ruins of the Twin Towers. Obama singing ""Amazing Grace"" after a mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Presidents play a unique role in the American psyche, Faggioli said, as both prime minister of the government and high priest of the so-called American civic religion. ""You can go through tragedies, but despair is not an option if you become commander-in-chief,"" he said. ""When you accept the job, you understand that you have to deliver on hope, no matter the circumstances."" Alex Seitz-Wald is senior digital politics reporter for NBC News.

99,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/650251438/0/phoenix/nation~Exclusive-Biden-to-urge-Congress-to-pass-antigun-violence-legislation-in-Wednesday-address/,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden will use his first address to a joint session of Congress Wednesday to pressure lawmakers to confront gun violence, underscoring the administration's focus on fulfilling a campaign pledge that had been mostly overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic. During his remarks, Biden will reiterate his characterization of gun violence as an epidemic, both in the drumbeat of recent mass shootings and a spike in homicides and gun violence in communities across the country, a White House official told USA TODAY. Biden will again urge Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines — a measure he helped pass as a senator in 1994. He will repeat calls for Congress to pass two House bills to strengthen background checks for gun buyers and close the so-called Charleston loophole, which allows gun sales to proceed without a completed background check if three business days have lapsed, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president's remarks. The bills, which have broad public support, have languished in an evenly divided Senate where Democrats would need to maintain their razor-thin majority while also finding 10 Republican votes. Biden on guns: Biden looks to stem 'ghost guns,' unveils other steps to curb gun violence 'epidemic' The U.S. has seen 142 mass shootings since Biden took office, including 46 mass shootings in April alone, according to the independent data collection and research group Gun Violence Archive. The group defines a mass shooting as incident with four or more people injured or killed. Earlier this month, Biden declared gun violence as an ""epidemic and an international embarrassment"" as he announced half a dozen executive actions aimed at curbing the proliferation of so-called ghost guns, or untraceable weapons that can be constructed from parts purchased online, as well as tightening regulations on the kind of stabilizing braces for pistols used in last month's Boulder, Colorado, shooting that left 10 people dead. The orders, billed as the administration's first steps to tackle gun violence, fell short of Biden's campaign pledge to reinstate an assault weapons ban, create a voluntary gun buyback program and send a bill to Congress to repeal liability protections for gun manufacturers and close background check loopholes on his first day in office. The president instead used his first weeks to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package and, more recently his plans for a sprawling $4 trillion spending proposal on infrastructure as well as education and childcare which he is also expected to lay out during his address. The laser focus on the pandemic frustrated some advocates, who pressed the president to follow through on his ambitious gun control agenda before the nation's attention faded in the wake of a rash of mass shootings in Atlanta, Colorado and Indianapolis. White House honors victims: 'Once again, I have the solemn duty of ordering the flag lowered,' Biden says after Indianapolis shooting A balancing act: Biden faces tough balancing act on infrastructure as pressure builds on immigration, gun control Part of Biden's infrastructure proposal includes a $5 billion investment in community violence intervention programs over eight years, but the president has also issued an executive action to direct five federal agencies to alter 26 different programs to make funding immediately available for community violence intervention programs. Biden is expected to touch on the political realities of passing gun safety legislation and the partisan gridlock that has stalled previous efforts, including his own as a senator and later as former President Barack Obama's vice president following the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre, the official said. In 1993, Biden helped shepherd through Congress the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. A year later he helped implement a 10-year ban on assault weapons. Though none of what Biden will say is new, the decision to raise gun safety in his first joint address signals to the legislature that it has a responsibility to break the political stalemate, according to Kris Brown, president of the gun safety advocacy group Brady. ""Change happens slowly and then all at once,"" Brown said. ""There's a reason that we are saying the time is now. We have a House that has passed these bills, an opportunity to get these things done in the Senate, and we have a president finally who will sign these into law."" The president's plea appears to echo a similar one made by Obama at the State of the Union in 2013, two months after Sandy Hook, in which he told Congress victims of gun violence — many of whom were seated in the room — ""deserve a vote."" Biden presided over the Senate chamber when a gun safety package failed to pass two months later. Despite the uphill battle, Democrats are heeding the president's call. Last week Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., reintroduced a bill to remove protections for manufacturers and sellers from consumer negligence lawsuits and allow victims of gun violence to pursue legal recourse. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a key Democrat leading gun control efforts, told CNN's Anderson Cooper last week that he's made calls to almost half the Republican caucus ""asking them to keep an open mind."" More: Many states were already advancing new gun rules this year, even before recent mass shootings The president will also underline the popularity of the reforms he's proposing on gun safety, including among gun owners, the official added. A Morning Consult-Politico tracking poll released earlier this month found 64% of registered voters said they backed stricter gun control laws, compared with 28% who said they were opposed to more stringent legislation. Among the most popular measures were expanding background checks and so-called ""red flag"" laws that enable courts to temporarily bar people in crisis from accessing firearms if they may hurt themselves or others.",2021-04-28 06:01:15,Exclusive: Biden to urge Congress to pass anti-gun violence legislation in Wednesday address,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Toddler killed at birthday party The public's priority on enacting new laws to try to address gun violence has waned from its level three years ago, despite continued mass shooting incidents across the country. Fifty percent in this ABC News/Washington Post poll prioritize enacting new gun violence laws while 43% prefer a focus on protecting the right to own guns, a seven-point margin. That's narrowed from a 23-point, 57-34% preference for new legislation in April 2018, after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that killed 17, prompting national gun violence protests. See PDF for full results, charts, and tables. The decline brings a return to a closer division of opinions even with a series of shootings since mid-March, including ones leaving nine dead at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, 10 dead at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado, and eight dead at three spas near Atlanta.  Intensity of sentiment also is about evenly divided in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with about four in 10 in both camps saying they feel strongly about their preference. President Joe Biden has responded to the recent shootings by announcing six executive orders and expressing support for new legislation. The public fractures on his approach: Thirty-two percent say he's doing too little, while an identical share say he's doing too much in terms of enacting laws to try to reduce gun violence. Nearly as many, 28%, think he's doing the right amount. Views that Biden is doing too little peak among liberals, at 52%; those who prioritize new laws over protecting gun rights, 48%; and also within his own party: Forty-seven percent of Democrats say the president is doing too little to try to enact new laws intended to curb gun violence. Conversely, about six in 10 Republicans and people who prioritize protecting the right to own guns think Biden is doing too much. Views among independents are mixed, with 36% seeing Biden's actions as ""too much,"" 29% ""too little"" and 28% the right amount.  As noted, preference for new legislation is down seven percentage points since last measured in April 2018. The decline is sharpest among 18 to 29-year-olds, from 65% to 45%; Hispanics, also down 20 points, to 50%; rural Americans, down 17 points to 30%; and strong conservatives, down 17 points to 11%. Divisions across political and ideological lines remain sharp. Three-quarters of Republicans prioritize protecting the right to own guns, as do 68% of conservatives -- including 81% of strong conservatives. Conversely, 83% of Democrats and liberals alike favor enacting new laws to try to reduce gun violence. Independents split 48-43% between protecting gun rights and enacting new laws. Among other groups, rural adults favor protecting the right to own guns by a 2-1 margin, 60 versus 30%. That essentially flips among urbanites, with 61% favoring new laws versus 34% for protecting gun rights. Suburban residents divide evenly, 48-45%. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone April 18-21, 2021, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,007 adults.

On Wednesday, the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association announced that this year’s event will be held over two weekends — July 23-25 and July 30-Aug. 1. “We have all been confronted with so many changes due to COVID-19. There is a great community desire to see the festival come back,” said Tom Cline, association president, in a statement. “Together, we can work to reimagine a Gilroy Garlic Festival that will promote and honor everything that makes Gilroy truly the Garlic Capital of the World.” Cline went on to say that the festival “seeks to be more than one signature event.” Highlights, as announced by the association, include: The Gilroy Garlic Festival Association said it is working with the Santa Clara County Health Department to obtain approval for the Gourmet Alley Drive-Through experience. It has been a difficult couple of years for the festival, normally held at Christmas Hill Park. Organizers had hoped to hold the event in 2020 as a symbol of civic unity after a mass shooting at the 2019 festival. But the coronavirus crisis thwarted those plans. The shooting occurred July 28, 2019, as the 41st annual event — one of the nation’s most famous food festivals — was wrapping up its three-day run. A 19-year-old gunman opened fire on the crowd, killing three and wounding 17. He later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. Besides drawing food lovers from around the country, the festival serves as Gilroy’s top fund-raiser for the year, with volunteers staffing the event to earn money for their clubs, schools and other nonprofit groups. Since 1979, the festival has raised more than $12 million for local nonprofits and schools. “We will continue to work to connect our community with various smaller events, educational activities, and giving opportunities throughout the year,” Cline said. “Our historic mission to strengthen the bonds within our community is an ongoing commitment.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2021-04-28 13:02:08,‘Reimagined’ Gilroy Garlic Festival announces summer dates,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

The Washington Post/ABC News poll taken in 2018 after the Parkland mass shooting demonstrated a peak of enthusiasm for gun-control laws, 57/34. Three years later, that has shifted sixteen points in the gap, 50/43. So what happened? Support for prioritizing new legislation to reduce gun violence has declined from a high in 2018, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, although the share of people preferring to prioritize laws to reduce gun violence still outweighs the share saying protecting the right to own guns should be prioritized. And there is public support for such policies. The Post-ABC poll finds 50 percent of Americans support enacting new laws to reduce gun violence, down from a peak of 57 percent after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Just over 4 in 10, 43 percent, of Americans say protecting the right to own guns should be a bigger priority, up from 34 percent in 2018. First off, we can be reasonably sure that this context isn’t germane. The Post and ABC almost tripped over themselves getting this poll done after a series of similar events in the last few weeks, as their next paragraph notes: The poll comes after several mass shootings this year, including those that left eight dead at Atlanta-area Asian spas, eight dead at an Indianapolis FedEx warehouse and 10 dead at a Colorado grocery store. President Biden has faced pressure to pursue stricter gun laws and policies, and this month he announced executive actions, including new rules on guns assembled at home and actions to make it harder for unqualified people to obtain firearms. Biden also pledged to push for sweeping changes to the country’s firearm laws, though any new legislation will face tall odds in a closely divided Senate. And yet, that seems not to have mattered at all. If that “pressure” was broad, we would have seen similar numbers as in 2018, and we certainly wouldn’t have seen “strong” support shifting between the poles. That, however, is precisely what this poll demonstrated: Most Americans hold strong views on the issue, but the balance of those views appears to have shifted in the past three years. Today, 42 percent of Americans say that they “strongly” believe that enacting new laws should be a priority, while 38 percent say they strongly believe that protecting the right to own guns should be prioritized. In 2018, strong support for enacting new laws outpaced strong support for protecting gun rights by 50 percent to 31 percent. 42/38 would be within the overall margin of error in this poll, and the MoE would likely be even higher for these subgroups. It’s essentially a tie, when three years ago the difference between the poles was nineteen points. One has to assume that the Post and ABC are disappointed that their rush to poll in the immediate aftermath of a few mass shootings didn’t provide a clear message of support for more gun laws. This demonstrates a serious issue with the Post/ABC polling strategy, as well as their intellectual honesty. The true way to poll over time on an issue is to do so at regular intervals, not when the mood strikes. Gallup and Pew do regular-interval polling on public issues, which are not driven by current events and launched in what seems to be an attempt to manipulate people through the polling equivalent of ambulance chasing. That’s not the only issue of honesty in this presentation, either. The chart in the WaPo article lists only three data points over eight years, although the lines in the chart hint at a fourth — one in which it appears that protecting gun rights had a slightly higher priority. Why weren’t those data points listed on the chart?  Either someone flunked line drawing in elementary school, or the Post doesn’t want us to see the specifics of a poll that appears to have been taken in 2016. Their analysis refers repeatedly to the 2018 and 2013 surveys, but they never mention a fourth poll where those lines converge. Nevertheless, at least they reported on this poll and the dramatic loss of enthusiasm for more gun laws. It’s still at 50/43, but in a D+9 poll (33/24/35), it’s probably not entirely reflective of the population as a whole. (Worth noting: that’s the biggest D/R gap in the WaPo/ABC polling in at least a year.) In a polling series over time, even one as problematic as this series. the shift is too big to ignore. Despite the gains made by Democrats in 2018 and 2020, this cuts directly against their arguments of a groundswell of public support for their agenda. So why has there been such a loss of enthusiasm for gun control? We’d know better if the WaPo/ABC polling units committed to proper interval polling on public opinion, but it’s likely due to the Democratic embrace of “abolish/defund the police” sloganeering and a sharp rise in crime, especially violent crime, over the past year. If we’re abolishing or rolling back police departments, then self-defense becomes even more crucial as crime rises. Democrats are trying to argue two entirely contradictory points at the same time — that only cops should have guns, and that we shouldn’t have cops. Small wonder that voters have grown less enthusiastic about disarming Americans in the mess that Democrats created over the past year. By this time next year, the Post’s chart will have to sport yet another trend-line convergence with no listed data points. Update: My friend Chris Field at The Blaze tried to get an answer about the missing 2015 polling data. Judge for yourself whether he succeeded: Hey, @EmGusk & @sfcpoll, your graph on support for gun laws appears to be missing some data. Can you fill in the gaps on what happened in circa 2016?

104,https://hotair.com/ed-morrissey/2021/04/28/broward-superintendent-of-schools-on-second-thought-i-quit-n386452,"What a difference a day makes. After getting indicted for perjury, Broward County schools superintendent Robert Runcie declared yesterday that the grand jury had conducted a politically motivated attack tied to the fallout from the Parkland mass shooting in 2018. Runcie insisted that he “will be vindicated,” and that he would demand full “due process” as he defended himself and his position: By last night, however, Runcie decided that discretion really is the better part of valor: After he was charged with lying to a grand jury earlier this month, Robert W. Runcie insisted he would “be vindicated.” The schools superintendent in Broward County, Fla. had spent years battling accusations tied to his leadership before and after the Parkland school shooting — and the indictment, he claimed, was simply another politically motivated attack tied to the massacre. Yet, less than 24 hours after saying as much in a video on Tuesday, Runcie appeared to change his tune. “I will step aside so you can have the peace you are looking for,” he told Broward school board member Lori Alhadeff in a meeting later that night. Her 14-year-old daughter Alyssa was one of 17 people killed in the mass shooting in February 2018. “Change his tune” is understating it. Bear in mind that the specific investigation in which Runcie has been indicted for perjury wasn’t actually related to the Parkland shooting. The grand jury in Broward is conducting a wide-ranging review of several investigations involving public agencies and officials, only part of which involves the massacre. Prosecutors allege that Runcie and the district’s general counsel Barbara Myrick tried to contact witnesses and discuss their testimony ahead of appearances to the grand jury and then lied about it. The issue was a questionable technology contract, however, not the shooting: Facing the prospect of a statewide grand jury, Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie contacted witnesses in a criminal case to prepare for his testimony, then he lied about it under oath when asked, prosecutors say. The superintendent took the steps just two days before appearing before the grand jury but then testified that he hadn’t, prosecutors said. … Broward Schools General Counsel Barbara Myrick also was charged with disclosing the grand jury’s top secret proceedings. Both charges stem from the indictment of former Broward Schools technology chief Tony Hunter, who was charged in January with rigging contracts for technology equipment for the district, as well as accepting illegal compensation from a vendor. This doesn’t mean that Runcie’s guilty. An indictment is not a conviction, and prosecutors will need to prove this allegation in court. However, this quick 180 on “vindication” seems very odd — as if Runcie figured at first that he could paint this as related to the shooting, rather than on the more mundane issue of potential corruption. Or, perhaps Runcie and his attorneys see the potential of more charges coming his way — witness tampering might fit the facts in this indictment, or perhaps from another part of the investigation. Whatever reasons Runcie has, those details will unfold sooner rather than later. The two-year grand jury probe must be close to reaching a conclusion if they are reporting indictments, so we will see just how much more information we will get from the Parkland shooting — and the failures of Broward County schools and law enforcement that played into it. Among other issues, clearly. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media. All Rights Reserved.",2021-04-28 08:01:07,"Broward superintendent of schools: On second thought, I quit",,117,http://hotair.com

Wednesday, 28 April 2021 09:37 AM Public support for prioritizing new laws to reduce gun violence has declined from a high 3 years ago, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Wednesday. The survey found that 50% of Americans back enacting new legislation to reduce gun violence. That number was down from a peak of 57% after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Despite the drop in support, the 50% backing is more than the 43% of Americans who said protecting the right to own guns should be a more important priority, which is up from 34% just 3 years ago. This latest poll was conducted following several recent mass shootings, including 8 people killed at Atlanta-area Asian spas, 8 murdered at an Indianapolis FedEx warehouse, and 10 killed at a Colorado grocery store. President Joe Biden, who earlier this month enacted executive actions regarding gun violence, has faced increased pressure to bring about stricter firearm legislation and policies. He also has vowed to push for new legislation that will enact sweeping changes to gun control laws, although achieving this goal will be extremely difficult in a closely divided Senate. Other results from the poll include: The survey was conducted by telephone among a random national sample of 1,007 adults, with 75% reached on cellphones and 25% on landlines.

106,https://www.gazettenet.com/Letter-Barbara-Sharp-40115737," Far too often lately, we hear another news story about a mass shooting in this country. And almost always, we hear from the news anchors reporting these events: “Police are still searching for a motive,” or “The motive remains a mystery at this point.” Means, motive and opportunity: this trinity is what sleuths use to try to learn who committed a crime. If they don’t know who the perpetrator is, finding the answers to these can help to identify him or her. But if the perpetrator is known, these questions become irrelevant. The crime has been solved. Why try to unravel a motive for an act of murder when the killer is already known? Even if one is able to find the motive, what purpose does that serve? Each of the far-too-many recent mass killings is unique. Finding a motive for one will not prevent — or even lessen the chances of — another one from happening. Law enforcement and government officials should not waste time searching for a motive. They should spend that time searching for justice and for a solution to discourage further violence. Banning assault weapons, strengthening background checks, and improving mental health awareness and treatment might be a good place to start.

Robert Runcie said late Tuesday he was willing to step down, just hours after he released a video statement saying he would be cleared of perjury and would not resign. The district’s top lawyer also said Tuesday night she would resign. Both were indicted by a grand jury last week. Runcie filed a written plea of not guilty Wednesday. Runcie told the board Tuesday night that he was ready to resign after a majority of members said they wanted to either place him on leave or fire him. “I cannot put myself above the needs of our district,” he said. “We’re unfortunately in a climate where forgiveness, compassion and love have far too often taken a back seat to grievance, anger and hate.” Runcie, 59, has led the nation’s sixth-largest school district for nearly 10 years and had been lauded for closing the achievement gap between white and minority students. He had also been named superintendent of the year multiple times by both state and national organizations. But he faced intense criticism after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in 2018. Seventeen people were killed, and the parent of one victim and the wife of another now serve on the school board. Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed, has been one of Runcie's toughest critics, asking the board to fire him in 2019. That vote failed 6-3. “I know you’ve been in enormous amounts of pain that none of us can ever imagine,” Runcie told Alhadeff on Tuesday night. “I guess I’m part of the source of that in some ways. If it’s going to give you the peace you’re looking for, I will step aside.” A grand jury, originally impaneled to review school safety after Parkland, expanded its reach and examined a $17 million technology deal, leading to the indictment of former district administrator Tony Hunter on charges of bribery and bid tampering, the South Florida SunSentinel         reported. Contracts for interactive flat screen TVs went to a friend and future boss of Hunter who had sold him cars and a house at a discount. Runcie was accused of committing perjury while testifying about the technology deal. The video statement released by the superintendent earlier Tuesday repeated a suggestion by his attorney that politics was behind the indictment and he would be vindicated. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis came into office pledging to hold Runcie accountable for the Parkland shooting. DeSantis ordered the grand jury that eventually indicted him. Barbara Myrick, who was arrested on a felony charge of illegally disclosing information from the grand jury, decided to resign. The board will meet Thursday to discuss their separation agreements and decide who, if Runcie's resignation moves forward, will lead the district. Runcie makes $356,000 a year and would be entitled to $137,000 in severance. Myrick, who is paid $220,000 a year, would earn $84,615 in severance. Runcie's lawyer, Johnny McCray, told the SunSentinel his client's anticipated resignation was not part of a negotiation to resolve the criminal charge. “We intend to continue fighting these charges, and as he said earlier today, he will be vindicated.” The school district is expected to continue to pay the legal fees for Runcie and Myrick. If they are convicted, they would be expected to repay the district, said Marylin Batista, a district lawyer. “Traditionally the district has always paid for representatives of school district employees who’ve been charged with criminal or civil processes” when it’s related to their jobs, Batista said. Board member Laurie Rich Levinson, an ally of both Runcie and Myrick, said she was saddened by their likely resignations. “What happened here has nothing to do with our children, but Mr. Runcie is not putting himself above the needs of our children,” she said. Board member Debra Hixon, whose husband Chris died at Parkland, she she has never blamed Runcie or the district for the shooting. “My issue is what happened after,” she said. She tearfully urged a fractured board, often divided 5-4 on issues surrounding Runcie, to come together. “We can’t continue to be divisive and let it be about Feb. 14,” Hixon said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-04-28 13:53:33,Embattled superintendent for Parkland schools decides to resign,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The event, expected to draw thousands, comes two weeks after a former FedEx employee fatally shot the eight people, including         four members of Indianapolis’ Sikh community. While the Sikh community is hosting the event, the hope is that people from across the state will join to support the affected families “as Indianapolis begins the journey of healing together and helping each other during this excruciatingly difficult time,” said Rajanpreet Kaur, a spokesperson for the Sikh Coalition. Private ceremonies for victims from the Sikh community are also expected to take place in the coming week.         Their families continue to seek roughly two-dozen fast-tracked visas so relatives overseas may travel for funeral rites. The proceedings will begin with cremation and then be followed by up to 20 days of reading of the 1,400-page Guru Granth Sahib scripture. “During this excruciatingly difficult time, it is up to all of us to work together and help each other heal,” said Balwinder Singh, Indianapolis Sikh community leader. “Our hope is that Hoosiers of all backgrounds and Sikhs from across the Midwest join us on Saturday in supporting all of the families forever impacted by this tragedy.” Police said Brandon Scott Hole, 19, a former worker at the Indianapolis FedEx facility, killed eight people there on April 15 before killing himself. Authorities have not released a motive for the assault but said Hole was in possession of two assault rifles. Hole was able to purchase the guns legally, even after his mother called police last year to say her son might commit “suicide by cop,” because he never appeared before a judge for a         hearing under Indiana’s “red flag” law, Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears         said last week. The free event is scheduled from 1 to 4 p.m. Saturday and is open to the public. A full program and list of speakers have not been confirmed, but interfaith leaders and lawmakers at the local, state and federal levels have been invited, event organizers said.

109,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/opinion/police-reform-america.html,"Advertisement transcript [MUSIC PLAYING] Today on The Argument, policing is broken. So how should we fix it? Members of the jury I understand you have a verdict. Derek Chauvin’s been found guilty! Breaking news, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been found guilty in the death of George Floyd. Say his name! George Floyd! Cell phone video of Floyd’s death horrified Americans and galvanized a nationwide social justice movement, leading to protests in cities across the country and those calls for police reform. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer. We still must reform the system. Killed by police less than two days after the palpable relief felt over the guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial, the Minneapolis area in mourning again as the family of Dante Wright held his memorial service. Last week, an anxious America awaited the jury’s decision. Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on all charges for the murder of George Floyd. But whatever feelings greeted such a rare outcome were short-lived for many. The next day, a Virginia man named Isaiah Brown was on the phone with 911 police dispatch when a sheriff’s deputy shot him 10 times, allegedly mistaking the phone for a gun. It feels like every day in America, there’s a new name to learn, new footage of lethal police violence to witness, another community in mourning, pleading for change. There’s no debate here. Policing in America is broken. Where there is debate, though, is how to fix it. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Jane Coaston. And I don’t think we need to abolish the police. I do think we need some serious fixes, like getting rid of qualified immunity and having the police focusing on dwindling homicide clearance rates, rather than focusing on how best or how often to wield deadly force. Today, I’ve gathered three guests who approach reform differently to see where we agree and don’t. Rashawn Ray is a fellow at the Brookings Institute and a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. Randy Shrewsberry is a former police officer. He’s now the executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. And Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson is the first Black woman to serve as co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center in Tennessee, a social justice training center where seminal figures like Rosa Parks trained. Randy, Rashawn, Ash-Lee, welcome to The Argument. And thank you so much for joining me. Thanks so much for having us. So my own personal interest in police reform came from the experience of both overpolicing and underpolicing. My father’s Black, my mother is white. And being pulled over with my dad because he was driving a car he should not have been driving, a Mazda Miata, of which he was very proud of. But then they look in the car and they see me. And I’m wearing my ballet outfit because I was six. And the police officer, you could just see in his face being like, this is just stupid. This is just absolutely stupid. But then I went to a predominantly white high school, all girl’s Catholic high school in Cincinnati, Ohio. And the policing they experienced was totally different, absolutely different, where you would hear about interactions they would have with police in which they would be — and I’ve written about this before — they would be downright disrespectful to police. And I think we’ve seen that there is an expectation in this country of who is supposed to be policed and who is not supposed to be policed, that you’re supposed to go police those people over there, but if you order me to wear a mask, well, that’s just too much here. And we see time and time again that most killings by police start with traffic stops, mental health checks, domestic disturbances, low level offenses. We’ve seen with the cases of Philando Castile and others that traffic stops can be deadly. Randy, where does this come from? Why is the focus on low level offenses and not solving murders? I think a lot of people think that the police are focused on catching criminals, when that’s not really what they do. No, so I’m from Cincinnati, by the way. And I work just outside of Cincinnati as a police officer. And it was an old, retired police captain who was one of our academy commanders who said to me this. And this was a time where I was a bit more conservative than I am today. I don’t really have much conservative viewpoints today. But he said whatever notions that you have of policing, dismiss them. This is while I was in the academy. He said your job is to arrest the three D’s: The drunk, the drugged, and the deranged. And that shook me because I thought these are society issues, right? These are things we can fix, instead of coming behind with enforcement, right? We can get ahead of these kinds of things. And so, over the years, what I realized is that in the academy, we were presented this picture. Like, the world is a war zone, right? Every time we step outside, there’s going to be bullets flying over our head. The bad guys are always out to get us, these kinds of things. And then I really realized that it was a pretty boring job. Most of the calls that I went to, normally speaking, there was some substance abuse issue, alcohol or mental health issues. So the commander was absolutely correct. These elements existed. And they were usually for small property crimes, petty disagreements between neighbors that could be handled inside the community. And so while there was no defined quota in any of the agencies that I ever worked at, is just that we knew that the administration was going to start leaning on us if we weren’t generating tickets, if we weren’t making arrests. Well, where would we go to do that? We’d go sit in a poor neighborhood, wait for somebody in a junkie car drive by, who may have an expired tag, or a headlight out, a taillight out, and go on these fishing expeditions. And then we’d find somebody with a little bit of weed. Or they maybe have a suspended license, which were almost always, by the way, because they were poor and had an unpaid traffic ticket or weren’t able to pay for their insurance. That put numbers on the spreadsheet. My very first department was all the way out in the boonies. And it was just a small department with five people. I mean, you would easily go a couple of shifts and not get one call for service. So everything that we did was, quote unquote, “proactive policing.” Well, then, over the next 13 years, I worked for the largest department in Indiana, the second or third largest department in South Carolina. It was the same thing. It was just this absolute overemphasis on these petty crimes, while major crimes were going uninvestigated. Right, I think that we see so much of what policing has looked like, which is about the criminalization of poverty. I think it’s important to note here that this is something that I want to emphasize that police and justice impacts everyone with the cases of someone like Daniel Shaver, who was shot to death while crying on the floor, or Tony Timpa, who is held down by police while they laughed on body cam, and how much of this is the policing of poverty and the policing of what we think police are supposed to be doing is not what they’re doing. And so, Rashawn, I want to hear from you. You’ve done so much work on this. What are your top priorities when it comes to reforming policing? Yeah, so I started out in this work by doing a lot of work with law enforcement, training them on implicit bias, training them on de-escalation, developing this innovative virtual reality program. But what I quickly realized is that that’s limited because some of the things that Randy’s talking about are some of the minute things that law enforcement can’t control, like training and even maybe how they respond to certain things where, really, what I started noticing is that when you follow the money and when you follow the policy, what you realize is that oftentimes municipalities are lifted up by the things that Randy talked about, these low level citations. That’s how we got Ferguson, right? That’s how we ended up with the death of Michael Brown. So what all of this led me to is when you follow the money, just over the past five years, in the major 20 metropolitan areas in the United States, taxpayers have paid out over $2 billion with a B in settlements for police misconduct. Oftentimes, people are paying for their own brutality, so outside of police budgets, which have swelled over the past three decades. I mean, you have everything from over 40 percent in Oakland to well over 35 percent in cities like Chicago and Minneapolis, that these civilian payouts don’t even come from the police budget. And what it led me to is that if we had police department insurance policies, if we had more police officer malpractice individual liability insurance, we would see not only a shift in financial culpability, but also a shift in accountability. And so, part of how it would operate would be similar to what happens in healthcare, that in healthcare, hospitals have insurance, physicians have insurance. Law enforcement officers must be above reproach. Similar to pilots, they must be perfect, or else, people die. And so part of this shift, since most places are small, they already are part of insurance risk pools, such as small departments in east Tennessee or outside of Los Angeles, where officers that have been removed have become uninsurable because they’ve engaged in misconduct. Departments have actually closed because insurance risk pools have said, we can no longer afford to keep you here. You know what? That helps to address bad apples that come from rotten trees. See, we limit things to bad apples, not realizing that it’s a process. They come from somewhere. And they come from rotten trees in law enforcement. And the roots are embedded in white supremacy ideology that oftentimes we’re unwilling to admit. The other thing, good apples can’t simply override bad apples. Yes, overwhelmingly, officers get into it because they want to protect and serve. But we just heard from Randy what happens in that process. Good apples become poisoned. And they also can at times become rotten themselves. Because part of what happens is that they get swallowed up in the system. And due to qualified immunity, they are completely alleviated from any sort of financial culpability. And I think insurances can be a huge way to increase accountability. But would you say that part of the problem here is what police are being asked to do in the first place? For instance, the F.B.I. reports that in 2019, across the U.S, 45.5 percent of violent crimes, including homicide, aggravated assault, rape, and robbery, were cleared. And by cleared, they mean someone got arrested, or the case was closed for some other reason. So it seems that part of this is, yes, there needs to be accountability for the bad apples and for all the apples. But what are the apples being asked to do in the first place? So there are two things happening. First, law enforcement is asked to solve our society’s social problems with force. And it’s not right. Part of the other thing that happens is that all calls about anything under the sun, from a cat being up in a tree to a pothole to a murder, comes in a 911. And we deploy police and acting like they have the skillset to be able to handle all of those type of responses. So oftentimes, they are being set up for failure because they overly train toward use of force tactics and worst case scenarios, instead of the over 90 percent of cases that are non-violent and have nothing to do with force at all. What do you expect for them to do when they’re in a stressful situation? They respond with what they’ve been trained to do the most. So part of what we have to think through is better solutions. And what the research I’ve conducted suggests is that if we reallocate some of those calls for service, not only are there better people in the social service sector, such as mental health specialists or Department of Transportation better equipped to handle those things, but also police officers can then focus on the more violent crimes and increasing that clearance rate. Not only is there this overemphasis about force, but when we look at how are police officers trained to solve crimes, how to investigate crimes, a small portion of their basic training is surrounding how to investigate crimes. When you’re sent to more advanced schools, we looked at all of the advanced training here in the state of California, so homicide training, sexual assault investigation training, burglary, robbery, car thefts: These are courses that are two weeks or less. I was an investigator as a certified fire and explosion investigator, which sounds like a really cool title. I went to two weeks of school to get this and then later, learned about junk science and forensics, which is a whole other episode. But what I realized is that we’re locking people up. We’re not getting justice for families, especially justice for people who are victims of violent crime, simply because the prioritizations of the police department is incorrect. And the officers are just not prepared in training to be able to investigate these crimes. Ash, we started talking about reallocating resources. And I saw your eyes light up a little bit. Can you talk about how you think about solutions? You’ve been a proponent of defunding police, which is something people have heard a lot, but aren’t really sure of how it would work conceptually. Can you walk us through what that would look like and how you came to that position? Yeah. I mean, I think lovingly, I came to this position because we’ve been putting platinum bandaids and piecemeal reforms into place. And it hasn’t made policing any better for Black people or poor people or immigrant people, right? When we talk about defunding the police, we’re not just talking about the sheriff in your county or the P.D. in your inner city neighborhood. We’re talking about the state police. We’re talking about Capitol police who we literally watched hand-walk insurrectionists out of the Capitol on January 6. We’re talking about immigrant communities that are impacted by I.C.E., right? We’re talking about Customs and Border Patrol. We’re talking about the military interventions that force migrants to come to this country in the first place, only to then be policed for being here, right? And so I just want to be clear. The only solution isn’t to continue to attempt to reform a system that is working exactly as it was designed to, right? Policing is not broken in this country. It is literally designed to work in this way. Policing in this country makes people money. Incarceration in this country makes people money. The only solution to that is to abolish it. So, as much as I hear the hope of harm reduction and what Randy and Rashawn say, my question is, is like, OK, and if that doesn’t work and three people every day are murdered by police officers, then what? So for me, when I hear “defund the police,” what I hear is the beginning of a conversation. What I heard was an acknowledgment of the righteous rage, right, the deep grief and the abiding and contagious love of Black people that have had enough of the cumulative death of Black people at the hands of the police that wanted to do something about it. What I also hear sometimes in response to the defund demand is, like, that’s cute, Ash-Lee. Love you, sis, but that’s impossible. How do we keep people safe if we defund the police? But I bet if I asked you, Jane or Rashawn or Randy, to close your eyes and tell me a time where you felt safe, what did it feel like, you wouldn’t tell me that there was a cop there. And if it was, it would probably be because that cop might have been your dad or your mom or your aunt or your uncle, right? Not because they were in their uniform in a cop car policing somebody else. So quite frankly, I think the only solution to policing in this country is abolition. And how do we get there through divestment and investment is really super clear. Ash, you said that policing was working as it was designed. But my thought is, do you see the potential to redesign it, what policing could be in the absolute best version of it? For example, I know that I’ve called the police twice in my life. I called the police once when there were people in our backyard, and I was by myself. And I didn’t know who they were or what was going on. And I was very scared, and that was the first thing I thought to do because I thought I should probably not confront these people. Bad idea. And the second time was when I found a man who had passed out. There was a police officer about a block away because I lived in a neighborhood where police just hung out on the corner to just see what was happening for reasons one might assume. And in both of those instances, I felt as if this is an entity that is not me, that is someone who will provide an answer of some sort. Can’t we just redetermine what police do? I mean, I hear it as an option, right? I hear it is an option, a logical option. [LAUGHS] I’m intellectually understand it. I’m really appreciative, very appreciative. I do, I really do. I mean, I get it, right? It’s like, there are things. Harm happens, right? But usually, when police officers are called, it’s not to eradicate the world of harm. It’s because harm has already happened. And they are called in to punish the person. Now if what we know is the criminalization in this country is racialized and gendered and rooted in a class hierarchy, then if they are being called in to punish someone for harm, that harm is probably connected to this racist, patriarchal, elitist understanding of what harm is in the first place, right? So could we live in a world, Jane, where cops no longer are weaponized in a way to punish people for harms that shouldn’t be likely illegal in the first place? Like, sure, some people are arguing that those are solutions. But what I would argue is those are platinum bandaids. Let’s go back to Rashawn’s metaphor. If policing is the rotten tree with white supremacist roots that is producing rotten fruit, then why would we continue to put bandaids on the rotten apples and a hope that the exceptional good fruit will be produced, versus taking the resources that we’re spending on those platinum bandaids and putting them into community solutions, right? It’s like usually when people tell me that abolition is impossible, they say because there isn’t really an alternative to policing. There are usually three times where people tell me we can’t — three or four, four times — let’s say four — where there are no alternative to what we ought to be doing in our communities if there weren’t police, right? It’s if someone’s in a mental health crisis, who handles traffic stops, what happens if there’s violent crime, and what happens in a world where there still is gender-based violence, right? If we’re talking about mental health services, police are more likely to use lethal force when a person is experiencing psychiatric distress. If we’re talking about traffic services, one of the services that police regularly provide to our communities, here’s an area again where armed uniformed police are absolutely unnecessary, right? If we’re talking about violent crime, our common refrain in opposition to defunding the police assumes that our society won’t be able to effectively respond to it. But we have to remember that police do not prevent violence. In most incidents of violent crime, police are responding to a crime that’s already taken place. And when this happens, what we need from police is a service that we’ll investigate the crime and perhaps prevent such crimes from occurring in the future. But policing is actually ill, if at all, equipped to suit those needs. Do I think that we can reform our way out of the crisis of policing in this country? I do not. And I don’t because I’ve seen so many times us try. I’ve seen us say that if we just trained them more, it would be different. I’ve seen us say, if we just banned no-knock warrants, it would be different. I’ve seen us say, if we just got body cams on these cops, which is more and more and more money going to policing, but what we’ve seen is that that hasn’t distracted or detracted them because they can continue to use reasonable force as their get out of jail and accountability-free card. So I just don’t believe that the data shows that reforming our way out of policing is keeping Black people free and alive. Rawshawn, I think I saw you wanting to respond here. What do you think? I think what Ash is really getting at, to build on her profound statements of putting platinum bandaids on deep unhealed wounds, it’s quite profound. Look, can we live in a world where law enforcement doesn’t exist? Sure, but in order to do so, we have to address societal problems that police officers are expected to deal with versus those they are expected to prevent, like guns. So when we look at and we compare the United States to other industrialized nations, do they still experience racial brutality and racial profiling? Yes, but they don’t experience the level of police killings. Why? Because guns are not as accessible to the public or to police officers. And this is the other thing. When I think about abolition, people thought that ending slavery was something that would never happen. People thought that ending segregation was something that would never happen. But you know what? They did. But you know what also survived those historical periods? Law enforcement. You know why? Because law enforcement is the gatekeeper of legalized state sanctioned violence. Law enforcement abolition probably requires a revolution we haven’t seen before. Part of what abolitionists also want — because I think there are two main camps. There are some that are like, law enforcement shouldn’t exist. Prisons shouldn’t exist. There are others who are like, look, we need to reimagine it. Like those rotten trees, we need to cut it down. When you deal with a rotten tree or a rotten plant, simply cutting it down doesn’t make it go away. The roots come back, right? And oftentimes, the plant comes back stronger. And interestingly, it comes back in a different form, like it’s wrapped in a different package. And so, but there are some people who say, how about we address abolition from the standpoint of abolishing police departments as they currently stand and reimagining and rebuilding public safety in a way that’s different? See, even the terminology we use is really important — policing, law enforcement, public safety. Part of reimagining law enforcement is reimagining the terms we use for what safety means. And how I think about it is, who has the right to truly express their First Amendment right and be verbally and/or nonviolently expressive? It’s not illegal to be combative. That’s right. Right, it’s not illegal to curse. If you’re from the South, it might not be a morally right thing to do. Or if you’re a really religious person — I beg to differ. Southerners are the best cussers. [LAUGHTER] Well, yes, sure. But overall, people, it’s oftentimes some cultural differences there, right? And thinking through that, that’s not illegal. A person shouldn’t be brutalized for that. A person shouldn’t be killed for that. But you know who we found that that does have the right to do that? White people, and particularly, white women. They oftentimes — police officers don’t respond to them. They actually get more deferential when white women raise their voices at them and cuss at them. With Black women, they do the exact opposite. They get more aggressive. They escalate force. One more quick thing. Recently received a grant from the Russell Sage Foundation with some colleagues at the University of North Carolina. We’re examining the role that Black Lives Matter protests in cities have on local police reform. And we’re going through newspaper clips. And one of my colleagues was reading a clip. And he was saying, yeah, we need more police surveillance. We need to make sure that we watch what they’re doing. We need more training. This clip was from the 1980s, almost around the same time where Ash was talking about she was born. So here we are, continuously using the words “police reform,” acting like it works. And it doesn’t. We need transformation. We need reimagining. Police officers cannot do that. They don’t have the skillset to do it. And that is the way we have to think about this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Jane. My name is Josh. And I live in New York. And the thing I’ve been arguing about with my professors is the two-party system. I see it as just an extremely limiting system that people don’t fit nicely into. You can ask any Democrat or a Republican. And most of the time, I’ve never been able to find someone who completely aligns with one party’s platform. They just kind of choose that one because that’s one of the only two options they have. Thank you. What are you arguing about with your family, your friends, your frenemies? Tell me about the big debate you’re having in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324. And we might play an excerpt of it on a future episode. So, Randy, I think this is the perfect time for you to talk about the fact that police are not trained for this. That’s something you’ve really focused on. The type of policing that I grew up watching on “Law and Order,” that just doesn’t happen. [SHREWSBERRY LAUGHS] What do you think of the divestment argument? Sure, so I’m not in disagreement with Ash or Dr. Ray. I think this is something that we need to reimagine. Where I’m probably a little to the right is that I view it as workable, but a very long road. And so the question is, is, what do we do in the meantime? And here’s the issue from a training perspective is that we want to create a 21st century curriculum, one that has a focus on number one is teaching officers the historical context of policing and why we need to make a change, one that has a focus on criminology, so police officers have an understanding of what are the social impacts that cause crime in the first place. And then the greatest emphasis is on solving crimes, instead of, A, trying to prevent them, which we know the police do not do, or responding to minor calls that can be handled by unarmed folks. So, first and foremost is what we have to do in this curriculum is expand it to officers get about six months of training to cover about 60 topics. And a third of that is largely around use of force. When we look at international counterparts, only Iraq, Afghanistan, for whom we train their police, and Papua New Guinea have lower standards than the U.S. So our view is that we can fulfill the promises of better training. We can fulfill the promises of reimagining policing or public safety that doesn’t have to be a punitive only approach. The United States taxpayer is essentially asked to foot this impossible and never-ending bill to maintain this failed system of policing, right? I want to pull a little bit on Randy’s last point and what Dr. Ray raised about guns as well. It’s like even Forbes, I think, last week mentioned that more than one mass shooting per day has occurred in 2021. And so if cops keep me safe from gun violence, this stat wouldn’t be real, right? So if police officers were keeping Black people safe from gun violence, the world will be a very different place. And I doubt we would be having this conversation in the first place. We’ve got to actually be innovative beyond the request for support for more money for more trainings, for more technology. And so, quite frankly, when we think about what’s happening on the federal level legislatively right now with the Justice and Policing Act, I think the movement for Black — well, not I think — I know the movement for Black Lives unequivocally doesn’t support it. Because, again, it’s an attempt at 1990 solutions to a 2021 problem. The Justice and Policing Act bans no-knock warrants and chokeholds in drug cases. It adds data transparency provisions. It provides some oversight for the local procurement and military equipment by police. It changes the federal use of force standard to only when necessary, instead of reasonableness. And it ends qualified immunity for local and federal law enforcement officers. But it’s a flawed framework. It relies on a flawed root cause analysis and inaccurate theory of change. Two, it doesn’t defund. And then, three, it’s cops overseeing cops. And then, finally, body cameras, trainings, ineffective policy solutions that increase police budgets are embedded all throughout the bill. So if I was doing a side by side, I would say if that is the false solution, that the actual community invested solution is the Breathe Act, right? The federal omnibus bill that the Movement for Black Lives wrote as the legislative love letter to the folks that were in the streets in 2020, demanding “defund the police.” If the Justice and Policing Act puts more money in policing, the Breathe Act divests from the federal grants and agencies that are primarily funding law enforcement in the carceral state. And so, folks can check out more information on the Breathe Act at breatheact.org. And this is our opportunity to make dramatic change years in the making. Well, I know that we could clearly talk about this for several days. I just want to say thank you so much for bringing your ideas and for the work that you’re all doing on this. I think that this is — it’s a really challenging subject for so many reasons because it’s so personal. And because I think it’s so complex and complicated. It involves a lot of discussions about the way we want the world to be and the way the world is. And I just really appreciate your time. This was great. So good to see you all, and I’m looking forward to building with you soon. Thank you. Thank you so much for having us on. This was such a powerful and important conversation about how we transform policing in America. [MUSIC PLAYING] If you want to learn more about police reform, I recommend reading the text of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act of 2021. I also recommend The New York Times Magazine piece that features a roundtable of experts and organizers. It’s called, “The message is clear: policing in America is broken and must change. But how?” You can find links to all of these in our episode notes. Finally, I want to recommend the book, “Ghettoside, A True Story of Murder in America,” by Jill Leovy for a fascinating history of how policing has worked, or, more accurately, hasn’t worked in major cities for decades. To quote Leovy, “As a country, we have never been very good at the kind of thorough expert investigations that lead to swift arrest to render street justice moot.” The Argument is production of New York Times Opinion. It’s produced by Phoebe Lett, Elisa Gutierrez, and Vishakha Darbha, edited by Alison Bruzek and Paula Szuchman, with original music and sound design by Isaac Jones, and fact-checking by Kate Sinclair. Special thanks this week to Laura Juncadella, transcript [MUSIC PLAYING] Today on The Argument, policing is broken. So how should we fix it? Members of the jury I understand you have a verdict. Derek Chauvin’s been found guilty! Breaking news, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin has been found guilty in the death of George Floyd. Say his name! George Floyd! Cell phone video of Floyd’s death horrified Americans and galvanized a nationwide social justice movement, leading to protests in cities across the country and those calls for police reform. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer. We still must reform the system. Killed by police less than two days after the palpable relief felt over the guilty verdict in the Chauvin trial, the Minneapolis area in mourning again as the family of Dante Wright held his memorial service. Last week, an anxious America awaited the jury’s decision. Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on all charges for the murder of George Floyd. But whatever feelings greeted such a rare outcome were short-lived for many. The next day, a Virginia man named Isaiah Brown was on the phone with 911 police dispatch when a sheriff’s deputy shot him 10 times, allegedly mistaking the phone for a gun. It feels like every day in America, there’s a new name to learn, new footage of lethal police violence to witness, another community in mourning, pleading for change. There’s no debate here. Policing in America is broken. Where there is debate, though, is how to fix it. [MUSIC PLAYING] I’m Jane Coaston. And I don’t think we need to abolish the police. I do think we need some serious fixes, like getting rid of qualified immunity and having the police focusing on dwindling homicide clearance rates, rather than focusing on how best or how often to wield deadly force. Today, I’ve gathered three guests who approach reform differently to see where we agree and don’t. Rashawn Ray is a fellow at the Brookings Institute and a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland. Randy Shrewsberry is a former police officer. He’s now the executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform. And Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson is the first Black woman to serve as co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center in Tennessee, a social justice training center where seminal figures like Rosa Parks trained. Randy, Rashawn, Ash-Lee, welcome to The Argument. And thank you so much for joining me. Thanks so much for having us. So my own personal interest in police reform came from the experience of both overpolicing and underpolicing. My father’s Black, my mother is white. And being pulled over with my dad because he was driving a car he should not have been driving, a Mazda Miata, of which he was very proud of. But then they look in the car and they see me. And I’m wearing my ballet outfit because I was six. And the police officer, you could just see in his face being like, this is just stupid. This is just absolutely stupid. But then I went to a predominantly white high school, all girl’s Catholic high school in Cincinnati, Ohio. And the policing they experienced was totally different, absolutely different, where you would hear about interactions they would have with police in which they would be — and I’ve written about this before — they would be downright disrespectful to police. And I think we’ve seen that there is an expectation in this country of who is supposed to be policed and who is not supposed to be policed, that you’re supposed to go police those people over there, but if you order me to wear a mask, well, that’s just too much here. And we see time and time again that most killings by police start with traffic stops, mental health checks, domestic disturbances, low level offenses. We’ve seen with the cases of Philando Castile and others that traffic stops can be deadly. Randy, where does this come from? Why is the focus on low level offenses and not solving murders? I think a lot of people think that the police are focused on catching criminals, when that’s not really what they do. No, so I’m from Cincinnati, by the way. And I work just outside of Cincinnati as a police officer. And it was an old, retired police captain who was one of our academy commanders who said to me this. And this was a time where I was a bit more conservative than I am today. I don’t really have much conservative viewpoints today. But he said whatever notions that you have of policing, dismiss them. This is while I was in the academy. He said your job is to arrest the three D’s: The drunk, the drugged, and the deranged. And that shook me because I thought these are society issues, right? These are things we can fix, instead of coming behind with enforcement, right? We can get ahead of these kinds of things. And so, over the years, what I realized is that in the academy, we were presented this picture. Like, the world is a war zone, right? Every time we step outside, there’s going to be bullets flying over our head. The bad guys are always out to get us, these kinds of things. And then I really realized that it was a pretty boring job. Most of the calls that I went to, normally speaking, there was some substance abuse issue, alcohol or mental health issues. So the commander was absolutely correct. These elements existed. And they were usually for small property crimes, petty disagreements between neighbors that could be handled inside the community. And so while there was no defined quota in any of the agencies that I ever worked at, is just that we knew that the administration was going to start leaning on us if we weren’t generating tickets, if we weren’t making arrests. Well, where would we go to do that? We’d go sit in a poor neighborhood, wait for somebody in a junkie car drive by, who may have an expired tag, or a headlight out, a taillight out, and go on these fishing expeditions. And then we’d find somebody with a little bit of weed. Or they maybe have a suspended license, which were almost always, by the way, because they were poor and had an unpaid traffic ticket or weren’t able to pay for their insurance. That put numbers on the spreadsheet. My very first department was all the way out in the boonies. And it was just a small department with five people. I mean, you would easily go a couple of shifts and not get one call for service. So everything that we did was, quote unquote, “proactive policing.” Well, then, over the next 13 years, I worked for the largest department in Indiana, the second or third largest department in South Carolina. It was the same thing. It was just this absolute overemphasis on these petty crimes, while major crimes were going uninvestigated. Right, I think that we see so much of what policing has looked like, which is about the criminalization of poverty. I think it’s important to note here that this is something that I want to emphasize that police and justice impacts everyone with the cases of someone like Daniel Shaver, who was shot to death while crying on the floor, or Tony Timpa, who is held down by police while they laughed on body cam, and how much of this is the policing of poverty and the policing of what we think police are supposed to be doing is not what they’re doing. And so, Rashawn, I want to hear from you. You’ve done so much work on this. What are your top priorities when it comes to reforming policing? Yeah, so I started out in this work by doing a lot of work with law enforcement, training them on implicit bias, training them on de-escalation, developing this innovative virtual reality program. But what I quickly realized is that that’s limited because some of the things that Randy’s talking about are some of the minute things that law enforcement can’t control, like training and even maybe how they respond to certain things where, really, what I started noticing is that when you follow the money and when you follow the policy, what you realize is that oftentimes municipalities are lifted up by the things that Randy talked about, these low level citations. That’s how we got Ferguson, right? That’s how we ended up with the death of Michael Brown. So what all of this led me to is when you follow the money, just over the past five years, in the major 20 metropolitan areas in the United States, taxpayers have paid out over $2 billion with a B in settlements for police misconduct. Oftentimes, people are paying for their own brutality, so outside of police budgets, which have swelled over the past three decades. I mean, you have everything from over 40 percent in Oakland to well over 35 percent in cities like Chicago and Minneapolis, that these civilian payouts don’t even come from the police budget. And what it led me to is that if we had police department insurance policies, if we had more police officer malpractice individual liability insurance, we would see not only a shift in financial culpability, but also a shift in accountability. And so, part of how it would operate would be similar to what happens in healthcare, that in healthcare, hospitals have insurance, physicians have insurance. Law enforcement officers must be above reproach. Similar to pilots, they must be perfect, or else, people die. And so part of this shift, since most places are small, they already are part of insurance risk pools, such as small departments in east Tennessee or outside of Los Angeles, where officers that have been removed have become uninsurable because they’ve engaged in misconduct. Departments have actually closed because insurance risk pools have said, we can no longer afford to keep you here. You know what? That helps to address bad apples that come from rotten trees. See, we limit things to bad apples, not realizing that it’s a process. They come from somewhere. And they come from rotten trees in law enforcement. And the roots are embedded in white supremacy ideology that oftentimes we’re unwilling to admit. The other thing, good apples can’t simply override bad apples. Yes, overwhelmingly, officers get into it because they want to protect and serve. But we just heard from Randy what happens in that process. Good apples become poisoned. And they also can at times become rotten themselves. Because part of what happens is that they get swallowed up in the system. And due to qualified immunity, they are completely alleviated from any sort of financial culpability. And I think insurances can be a huge way to increase accountability. But would you say that part of the problem here is what police are being asked to do in the first place? For instance, the F.B.I. reports that in 2019, across the U.S, 45.5 percent of violent crimes, including homicide, aggravated assault, rape, and robbery, were cleared. And by cleared, they mean someone got arrested, or the case was closed for some other reason. So it seems that part of this is, yes, there needs to be accountability for the bad apples and for all the apples. But what are the apples being asked to do in the first place? So there are two things happening. First, law enforcement is asked to solve our society’s social problems with force. And it’s not right. Part of the other thing that happens is that all calls about anything under the sun, from a cat being up in a tree to a pothole to a murder, comes in a 911. And we deploy police and acting like they have the skillset to be able to handle all of those type of responses. So oftentimes, they are being set up for failure because they overly train toward use of force tactics and worst case scenarios, instead of the over 90 percent of cases that are non-violent and have nothing to do with force at all. What do you expect for them to do when they’re in a stressful situation? They respond with what they’ve been trained to do the most. So part of what we have to think through is better solutions. And what the research I’ve conducted suggests is that if we reallocate some of those calls for service, not only are there better people in the social service sector, such as mental health specialists or Department of Transportation better equipped to handle those things, but also police officers can then focus on the more violent crimes and increasing that clearance rate. Not only is there this overemphasis about force, but when we look at how are police officers trained to solve crimes, how to investigate crimes, a small portion of their basic training is surrounding how to investigate crimes. When you’re sent to more advanced schools, we looked at all of the advanced training here in the state of California, so homicide training, sexual assault investigation training, burglary, robbery, car thefts: These are courses that are two weeks or less. I was an investigator as a certified fire and explosion investigator, which sounds like a really cool title. I went to two weeks of school to get this and then later, learned about junk science and forensics, which is a whole other episode. But what I realized is that we’re locking people up. We’re not getting justice for families, especially justice for people who are victims of violent crime, simply because the prioritizations of the police department is incorrect. And the officers are just not prepared in training to be able to investigate these crimes. Ash, we started talking about reallocating resources. And I saw your eyes light up a little bit. Can you talk about how you think about solutions? You’ve been a proponent of defunding police, which is something people have heard a lot, but aren’t really sure of how it would work conceptually. Can you walk us through what that would look like and how you came to that position? Yeah. I mean, I think lovingly, I came to this position because we’ve been putting platinum bandaids and piecemeal reforms into place. And it hasn’t made policing any better for Black people or poor people or immigrant people, right? When we talk about defunding the police, we’re not just talking about the sheriff in your county or the P.D. in your inner city neighborhood. We’re talking about the state police. We’re talking about Capitol police who we literally watched hand-walk insurrectionists out of the Capitol on January 6. We’re talking about immigrant communities that are impacted by I.C.E., right? We’re talking about Customs and Border Patrol. We’re talking about the military interventions that force migrants to come to this country in the first place, only to then be policed for being here, right? And so I just want to be clear. The only solution isn’t to continue to attempt to reform a system that is working exactly as it was designed to, right? Policing is not broken in this country. It is literally designed to work in this way. Policing in this country makes people money. Incarceration in this country makes people money. The only solution to that is to abolish it. So, as much as I hear the hope of harm reduction and what Randy and Rashawn say, my question is, is like, OK, and if that doesn’t work and three people every day are murdered by police officers, then what? So for me, when I hear “defund the police,” what I hear is the beginning of a conversation. What I heard was an acknowledgment of the righteous rage, right, the deep grief and the abiding and contagious love of Black people that have had enough of the cumulative death of Black people at the hands of the police that wanted to do something about it. What I also hear sometimes in response to the defund demand is, like, that’s cute, Ash-Lee. Love you, sis, but that’s impossible. How do we keep people safe if we defund the police? But I bet if I asked you, Jane or Rashawn or Randy, to close your eyes and tell me a time where you felt safe, what did it feel like, you wouldn’t tell me that there was a cop there. And if it was, it would probably be because that cop might have been your dad or your mom or your aunt or your uncle, right? Not because they were in their uniform in a cop car policing somebody else. So quite frankly, I think the only solution to policing in this country is abolition. And how do we get there through divestment and investment is really super clear. Ash, you said that policing was working as it was designed. But my thought is, do you see the potential to redesign it, what policing could be in the absolute best version of it? For example, I know that I’ve called the police twice in my life. I called the police once when there were people in our backyard, and I was by myself. And I didn’t know who they were or what was going on. And I was very scared, and that was the first thing I thought to do because I thought I should probably not confront these people. Bad idea. And the second time was when I found a man who had passed out. There was a police officer about a block away because I lived in a neighborhood where police just hung out on the corner to just see what was happening for reasons one might assume. And in both of those instances, I felt as if this is an entity that is not me, that is someone who will provide an answer of some sort. Can’t we just redetermine what police do? I mean, I hear it as an option, right? I hear it is an option, a logical option. [LAUGHS] I’m intellectually understand it. I’m really appreciative, very appreciative. I do, I really do. I mean, I get it, right? It’s like, there are things. Harm happens, right? But usually, when police officers are called, it’s not to eradicate the world of harm. It’s because harm has already happened. And they are called in to punish the person. Now if what we know is the criminalization in this country is racialized and gendered and rooted in a class hierarchy, then if they are being called in to punish someone for harm, that harm is probably connected to this racist, patriarchal, elitist understanding of what harm is in the first place, right? So could we live in a world, Jane, where cops no longer are weaponized in a way to punish people for harms that shouldn’t be likely illegal in the first place? Like, sure, some people are arguing that those are solutions. But what I would argue is those are platinum bandaids. Let’s go back to Rashawn’s metaphor. If policing is the rotten tree with white supremacist roots that is producing rotten fruit, then why would we continue to put bandaids on the rotten apples and a hope that the exceptional good fruit will be produced, versus taking the resources that we’re spending on those platinum bandaids and putting them into community solutions, right? It’s like usually when people tell me that abolition is impossible, they say because there isn’t really an alternative to policing. There are usually three times where people tell me we can’t — three or four, four times — let’s say four — where there are no alternative to what we ought to be doing in our communities if there weren’t police, right? It’s if someone’s in a mental health crisis, who handles traffic stops, what happens if there’s violent crime, and what happens in a world where there still is gender-based violence, right? If we’re talking about mental health services, police are more likely to use lethal force when a person is experiencing psychiatric distress. If we’re talking about traffic services, one of the services that police regularly provide to our communities, here’s an area again where armed uniformed police are absolutely unnecessary, right? If we’re talking about violent crime, our common refrain in opposition to defunding the police assumes that our society won’t be able to effectively respond to it. But we have to remember that police do not prevent violence. In most incidents of violent crime, police are responding to a crime that’s already taken place. And when this happens, what we need from police is a service that we’ll investigate the crime and perhaps prevent such crimes from occurring in the future. But policing is actually ill, if at all, equipped to suit those needs. Do I think that we can reform our way out of the crisis of policing in this country? I do not. And I don’t because I’ve seen so many times us try. I’ve seen us say that if we just trained them more, it would be different. I’ve seen us say, if we just banned no-knock warrants, it would be different. I’ve seen us say, if we just got body cams on these cops, which is more and more and more money going to policing, but what we’ve seen is that that hasn’t distracted or detracted them because they can continue to use reasonable force as their get out of jail and accountability-free card. So I just don’t believe that the data shows that reforming our way out of policing is keeping Black people free and alive. Rawshawn, I think I saw you wanting to respond here. What do you think? I think what Ash is really getting at, to build on her profound statements of putting platinum bandaids on deep unhealed wounds, it’s quite profound. Look, can we live in a world where law enforcement doesn’t exist? Sure, but in order to do so, we have to address societal problems that police officers are expected to deal with versus those they are expected to prevent, like guns. So when we look at and we compare the United States to other industrialized nations, do they still experience racial brutality and racial profiling? Yes, but they don’t experience the level of police killings. Why? Because guns are not as accessible to the public or to police officers. And this is the other thing. When I think about abolition, people thought that ending slavery was something that would never happen. People thought that ending segregation was something that would never happen. But you know what? They did. But you know what also survived those historical periods? Law enforcement. You know why? Because law enforcement is the gatekeeper of legalized state sanctioned violence. Law enforcement abolition probably requires a revolution we haven’t seen before. Part of what abolitionists also want — because I think there are two main camps. There are some that are like, law enforcement shouldn’t exist. Prisons shouldn’t exist. There are others who are like, look, we need to reimagine it. Like those rotten trees, we need to cut it down. When you deal with a rotten tree or a rotten plant, simply cutting it down doesn’t make it go away. The roots come back, right? And oftentimes, the plant comes back stronger. And interestingly, it comes back in a different form, like it’s wrapped in a different package. And so, but there are some people who say, how about we address abolition from the standpoint of abolishing police departments as they currently stand and reimagining and rebuilding public safety in a way that’s different? See, even the terminology we use is really important — policing, law enforcement, public safety. Part of reimagining law enforcement is reimagining the terms we use for what safety means. And how I think about it is, who has the right to truly express their First Amendment right and be verbally and/or nonviolently expressive? It’s not illegal to be combative. That’s right. Right, it’s not illegal to curse. If you’re from the South, it might not be a morally right thing to do. Or if you’re a really religious person — I beg to differ. Southerners are the best cussers. [LAUGHTER] Well, yes, sure. But overall, people, it’s oftentimes some cultural differences there, right? And thinking through that, that’s not illegal. A person shouldn’t be brutalized for that. A person shouldn’t be killed for that. But you know who we found that that does have the right to do that? White people, and particularly, white women. They oftentimes — police officers don’t respond to them. They actually get more deferential when white women raise their voices at them and cuss at them. With Black women, they do the exact opposite. They get more aggressive. They escalate force. One more quick thing. Recently received a grant from the Russell Sage Foundation with some colleagues at the University of North Carolina. We’re examining the role that Black Lives Matter protests in cities have on local police reform. And we’re going through newspaper clips. And one of my colleagues was reading a clip. And he was saying, yeah, we need more police surveillance. We need to make sure that we watch what they’re doing. We need more training. This clip was from the 1980s, almost around the same time where Ash was talking about she was born. So here we are, continuously using the words “police reform,” acting like it works. And it doesn’t. We need transformation. We need reimagining. Police officers cannot do that. They don’t have the skillset to do it. And that is the way we have to think about this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Jane. My name is Josh. And I live in New York. And the thing I’ve been arguing about with my professors is the two-party system. I see it as just an extremely limiting system that people don’t fit nicely into. You can ask any Democrat or a Republican. And most of the time, I’ve never been able to find someone who completely aligns with one party’s platform. They just kind of choose that one because that’s one of the only two options they have. Thank you. What are you arguing about with your family, your friends, your frenemies? Tell me about the big debate you’re having in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324. And we might play an excerpt of it on a future episode. So, Randy, I think this is the perfect time for you to talk about the fact that police are not trained for this. That’s something you’ve really focused on. The type of policing that I grew up watching on “Law and Order,” that just doesn’t happen. [SHREWSBERRY LAUGHS] What do you think of the divestment argument? Sure, so I’m not in disagreement with Ash or Dr. Ray. I think this is something that we need to reimagine. Where I’m probably a little to the right is that I view it as workable, but a very long road. And so the question is, is, what do we do in the meantime? And here’s the issue from a training perspective is that we want to create a 21st century curriculum, one that has a focus on number one is teaching officers the historical context of policing and why we need to make a change, one that has a focus on criminology, so police officers have an understanding of what are the social impacts that cause crime in the first place. And then the greatest emphasis is on solving crimes, instead of, A, trying to prevent them, which we know the police do not do, or responding to minor calls that can be handled by unarmed folks. So, first and foremost is what we have to do in this curriculum is expand it to officers get about six months of training to cover about 60 topics. And a third of that is largely around use of force. When we look at international counterparts, only Iraq, Afghanistan, for whom we train their police, and Papua New Guinea have lower standards than the U.S. So our view is that we can fulfill the promises of better training. We can fulfill the promises of reimagining policing or public safety that doesn’t have to be a punitive only approach. The United States taxpayer is essentially asked to foot this impossible and never-ending bill to maintain this failed system of policing, right? I want to pull a little bit on Randy’s last point and what Dr. Ray raised about guns as well. It’s like even Forbes, I think, last week mentioned that more than one mass shooting per day has occurred in 2021. And so if cops keep me safe from gun violence, this stat wouldn’t be real, right? So if police officers were keeping Black people safe from gun violence, the world will be a very different place. And I doubt we would be having this conversation in the first place. We’ve got to actually be innovative beyond the request for support for more money for more trainings, for more technology. And so, quite frankly, when we think about what’s happening on the federal level legislatively right now with the Justice and Policing Act, I think the movement for Black — well, not I think — I know the movement for Black Lives unequivocally doesn’t support it. Because, again, it’s an attempt at 1990 solutions to a 2021 problem. The Justice and Policing Act bans no-knock warrants and chokeholds in drug cases. It adds data transparency provisions. It provides some oversight for the local procurement and military equipment by police. It changes the federal use of force standard to only when necessary, instead of reasonableness. And it ends qualified immunity for local and federal law enforcement officers. But it’s a flawed framework. It relies on a flawed root cause analysis and inaccurate theory of change. Two, it doesn’t defund. And then, three, it’s cops overseeing cops. And then, finally, body cameras, trainings, ineffective policy solutions that increase police budgets are embedded all throughout the bill. So if I was doing a side by side, I would say if that is the false solution, that the actual community invested solution is the Breathe Act, right? The federal omnibus bill that the Movement for Black Lives wrote as the legislative love letter to the folks that were in the streets in 2020, demanding “defund the police.” If the Justice and Policing Act puts more money in policing, the Breathe Act divests from the federal grants and agencies that are primarily funding law enforcement in the carceral state. And so, folks can check out more information on the Breathe Act at breatheact.org. And this is our opportunity to make dramatic change years in the making. Well, I know that we could clearly talk about this for several days. I just want to say thank you so much for bringing your ideas and for the work that you’re all doing on this. I think that this is — it’s a really challenging subject for so many reasons because it’s so personal. And because I think it’s so complex and complicated. It involves a lot of discussions about the way we want the world to be and the way the world is. And I just really appreciate your time. This was great. So good to see you all, and I’m looking forward to building with you soon. Thank you. Thank you so much for having us on. This was such a powerful and important conversation about how we transform policing in America. [MUSIC PLAYING] If you want to learn more about police reform, I recommend reading the text of the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act of 2021. I also recommend The New York Times Magazine piece that features a roundtable of experts and organizers. It’s called, “The message is clear: policing in America is broken and must change. But how?” You can find links to all of these in our episode notes. Finally, I want to recommend the book, “Ghettoside, A True Story of Murder in America,” by Jill Leovy for a fascinating history of how policing has worked, or, more accurately, hasn’t worked in major cities for decades. To quote Leovy, “As a country, we have never been very good at the kind of thorough expert investigations that lead to swift arrest to render street justice moot.” The Argument is production of New York Times Opinion. It’s produced by Phoebe Lett, Elisa Gutierrez, and Vishakha Darbha, edited by Alison Bruzek and Paula Szuchman, with original music and sound design by Isaac Jones, and fact-checking by Kate Sinclair. Special thanks this week to Laura Juncadella, Produced by ‘The Argument’ Derek Chauvin has been found guilty of the murder of George Floyd. But whatever bittersweet feelings the rare outcome elicited were short-lived, since instances of police brutality compound almost daily. There’s no debate: Policing is broken in America. But how do we fix it? [You can listen to this episode of “The Argument” on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.] To answer that question, Jane brings together a round table to debate solutions ranging from modernizing training, stronger ties between police misconduct and financial culpability, and divesting from policing to invest in community-based services. Joining Jane is Randy Shrewsberry, a former police officer and the executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform; Rashawn Ray, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland and a David M.

111,https://www.aol.com/news/embattled-florida-school-superintendent-decides-113135270-185101887.html," FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The South Florida school superintendent overseeing Parkland schools has offered to resign amid continuing criticism over the 2018 mass shooting there and a perjury charge from a statewide grand jury. Robert Runcie said late Tuesday he was willing to step down, just hours after he released a video statement saying he would be cleared of perjury and would not resign. The district’s top lawyer also said Tuesday night she would resign. Both were indicted by a grand jury last week. Runcie filed a written plea of not guilty Wednesday. Runcie told the board Tuesday night that he was ready to resign after a majority of members said they wanted to either place him on leave or fire him. “I cannot put myself above the needs of our district,” he said. “We’re unfortunately in a climate where forgiveness, compassion and love have far too often taken a back seat to grievance, anger and hate.” Runcie, 59, has led the nation’s sixth-largest school district for nearly 10 years and had been lauded for closing the achievement gap between white and minority students. He had also been named superintendent of the year multiple times by both state and national organizations. But he faced intense criticism after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in 2018. Seventeen people were killed, and the parent of one victim and the wife of another now serve on the school board. Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed, has been one of Runcie's toughest critics, asking the board to fire him in 2019. That vote failed 6-3. “I know you’ve been in enormous amounts of pain that none of us can ever imagine,” Runcie told Alhadeff on Tuesday night. “I guess I’m part of the source of that in some ways. If it’s going to give you the peace you’re looking for, I will step aside.” A grand jury, originally impaneled to review school safety after Parkland, expanded its reach and examined a $17 million technology deal, leading to the indictment of former district administrator Tony Hunter on charges of bribery and bid tampering, the South Florida SunSentinel reported. Contracts for interactive flat screen TVs went to a friend and future boss of Hunter who had sold him cars and a house at a discount. Runcie was accused of committing perjury while testifying about the technology deal. The video statement released by the superintendent earlier Tuesday repeated a suggestion by his attorney that politics was behind the indictment and he would be vindicated. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis came into office pledging to hold Runcie accountable for the Parkland shooting. DeSantis ordered the grand jury that eventually indicted him. Barbara Myrick, who was arrested on a felony charge of illegally disclosing information from the grand jury, decided to resign. The board will meet Thursday to discuss their separation agreements and decide who, if Runcie's resignation moves forward, will lead the district. Runcie makes $356,000 a year and would be entitled to $137,000 in severance. Myrick, who is paid $220,000 a year, would earn $84,615 in severance. Runcie's lawyer, Johnny McCray, told the SunSentinel his client's anticipated resignation was not part of a negotiation to resolve the criminal charge. “We intend to continue fighting these charges, and as he said earlier today, he will be vindicated.” The school district is expected to continue to pay the legal fees for Runcie and Myrick. If they are convicted, they would be expected to repay the district, said Marylin Batista, a district lawyer. “Traditionally the district has always paid for representatives of school district employees who’ve been charged with criminal or civil processes” when it’s related to their jobs, Batista said.

Board member Debra Hixon, whose husband Chris died at Parkland, she she has never blamed Runcie or the district for the shooting. “My issue is what happened after,” she said. She tearfully urged a fractured board, often divided 5-4 on issues surrounding Runcie, to come together. “We can’t continue to be divisive and let it be about Feb. 14,” Hixon said.",2021-04-28 14:51:01,Embattled Florida school superintendent offers to resign,,150985,http://news.aol.com/

          / CBS News The first 100 days is a somewhat arbitrary, if traditional milestone in a presidency, but it's one President Biden has embraced and even incorporated into his own goal-setting. Mr. Biden took office under difficult circumstances, during a deadly pandemic and as millions of Americans still harbored doubts that he had won the election. He made a number of promises centered on restoring normalcy to American life and rolling back actions taken by his predecessor, including a realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities. He has kept some promises, such as reentering the Paris climate agreement, broken others, and made some progress but not yet accomplished all of his early goals. Here's a status check on the key promises he made. Establish ""police oversight board"" in the first 100 days: Not kept As a candidate, Mr. Biden pledged in the days after George Floyd's death to form a national police oversight board in his first 100 days in office, if elected. But the White House announced earlier this month it would not create the oversight board. After talking with civil rights groups, the White House said it had concluded the most effective way to address the issues at hand would be to pass the proposed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law. The police reform bill is currently being discussed by Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. Increase Trump-era refugee cap: Broken (so far) Mr. Biden pledged to do away with Mr. Trump's record low refugee cap of 15,000 a year. In February, he promised to raise the cap to 62,500, as a kind of down payment on his intent to resettle up to 125,000 refugees in fiscal year 2022. But earlier this month, he broke that promise, keeping the refugee cap at 15,000 for now. Facing a backlash, his administration said it would increase that refugee cap in May. But the president has been widely criticized, by progressives and conservative faith-centered groups alike, for failing to increase the cap as promised. Without this pressure, it's not clear whether the administration would have increased the cap this fiscal year. Send immigration bill to Congress to ""modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship"": Kept promise; legislation stalled Mr. Biden sent an immigration proposal to Congress on his first day in office, but the tenets of the legislation have hit legislative hurdles, compounded by his administration's struggle to process the  thousands of migrants and unaccompanied children arriving every week. Read more about the legislative push from within Mr. Biden's own party. Repeal Trump-era tax cuts: He's working on it As a candidate, Mr. Biden said he'd fight for the repeal of the 2017 Republican tax cuts, a move that requires Congress. He's pushing for a hike in the corporate tax rate and taxes on Americans making more than $400,000. But boosting the corporate tax rate from its current rate of 21% to 28% is facing resistance from key Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has already said he wouldn't support a corporate tax rate that high. Reenter Paris climate accord: Kept Ahead of the election, Mr. Biden promised to re-enter the Paris climate accord, the 2016 agreement that former President Trump formally withdrew from last year. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden stated his acceptance of the agreement ""and every article and clause thereof on behalf of the United States of America."" On February 19, the U.S. formally re-entered the agreement. Convene world climate summit: Kept As a candidate, Mr. Biden promised to organize a ""climate summit"" to encourage world leaders to tackle climate change more aggressively, specifically addressing global shipping and aviation emissions. Last week, Mr. Biden and Harris hosted the Leaders Summit on Climate, albeit remotely because of COVID-19, with dozens of world leaders participating. The U.S.pledged to cut emissions levels at least by half by 2030 and other industrialized nations also made commitments: Canada pledged a 40-45% cut by 2030 and Japan doubled its goal. Other major emitters, like China, did not offer new goals. Read more here on the other takeaways from the summit. Give 100 million COVID-19 shots in the first 100 days: Kept President Biden's original goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days was easily exceeded — 200 million were administered by last week. The president upped his goal from 100 million to 200 million when it became clear he would easily meet the first target. The U.S. was already giving roughly 1 million shots a day when Mr. Biden took office. Use executive action to address greenhouse gas emissions: Kept but will require more work President Biden signed multiple executive actions related to climate change in his first 100 days in office. He revoked an earlier executive order issued by then-president Trump weakening the government's commitment to cutting greenhouse gases. He also announced a new target for the U.S. to reach a 50% to 52% reduction from 2005 levels in net greenhouse gas pollution by 2030, only nine years away. He made this announcement during the Leaders Summit on Climate he hosted last week. Reopen majority of K-8 schools nationwide by day 100: Kept School decisions are mostly made at the local level, but the Biden administration publicly pressed for a simple majority of K-8 schools to be back in the classroom in some form by the president's 100th day in office. Even though outside analysis from Burbio indicated a majority of students were already back in the classroom on their first day in office, the White House did not update this goal. In early March, the president pushed for states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and by April around 80% of educators were vaccinated or had an appointment scheduled, according to Education Department data. There are still significant pockets of students — about 6% nationwide — who are only learning virtually, according to data from Burbio. About 30% of students nationwide are learning in a hybrid system with the remaining approximately 65% of students back in the classroom full time. Repeal transgender military ban enacted by President Trump: Kept Mr. Biden repealed the Trump-era ban on transgender service in the military, which impacted approximately more than 15,000 people, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returned to guidance instituted during the Obama administration. The Pentagon in April announced new policies that, in part, will provide medical treatment during gender transition to service members' self-identified gender. On his first day in office, the president also issued an executive order aimed at combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. This was another campaign pledge kept — restoring Obama-era guidance for transgender students in schools. More gun control: In progress, but little done concretely Mr. Biden regularly promised to address ""loopholes"" in gun purchase checks, but much of that work will require legislation. After the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, in March, he called on Congress to pass legislation to close these loopholes. In early April, he signed targeted executive actions to address ""ghost guns"" and advocated for the Justice Department to outline ""red flag"" models that would temporarily stop people in mental anguish from possessing weapons. Mr. Biden also asked the Justice Department to issue a rule on stabilizing braces that attach to a pistol and add enough stability to, in essence, transform it into a short-barreled rifle subject to regulation by federal law. The alleged shooter in the March supermarket shooting in Boulder appears to have used a pistol with a brace. But one big promise on guns remains distant: the president wants to change the law providing liability protections to gun manufacturers if one of their guns is used in a crime.

Leave it to Rudy Giuliani to step all over Joe Biden's parade. That's the unfortunate takeaway for the new Democratic president who is planning to detail his first-term agenda and accomplishments over his first 100 days during Wednesday night's primetime address to a joint session of Congress. Now Biden and his allies in Congress will be sharing the spotlight — and the front-page of the Thursday newspapers — with the explosive headlines made by the Justice Department after it executed a search warrant on former President Donald Trump's personal lawyer. ""Justice moves when it moves,"" Christine Pelosi, a lawyer, Democratic strategist and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, told Insider. ""Is it part of their rollout? No. Does it step on their story? Yes. Do we want people to spend time in the news talking about the good things that are in the American Jobs Plan, the American Families Plan and how we just cut childhood poverty in half in the American recovery package? You betcha. Unfortunately, we will be splitting our attention."" There will obviously be great interest in the Giuliani story, Christine Pelosi said. But she urged Democrats to not fall into the trap of giving it too much air time in their own right. What's important is ""making sure that people come out of their emotional, economic, psychological depression that COVID has caused and also continuing to get relief to people, especially our frontline workers who are still dying of COVID,"" she said. Other Democrats feel the same way. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia doesn't see the Giuliani probe upending Biden's plans. ""Our government is able to walk, chew gum, and enforce the law all at the same time, because the American people deserve nothing less,"" Warner spokeswoman Rachel Cohen told Insider. Former Obama White House spokesman Jay Carney isn't buying the idea the Giuliani story will derail Biden's agenda. ""I honestly don't see a connection,"" Carney, a former Biden communications director when he was vice president, wrote in an email. Still, Wednesday's developments with Giuliani reflect one of the stark realities any White House must deal with. Whether it be a natural disaster, a mass shooting or an FBI raid: Sometimes you can't control what is happening in the world and what it does to your own messaging. The problem with the Giuliani story is that now it becomes a drip-drip saga that raises even more questions about Trump's own legal liability, a development that could very well suck up valuable oxygen that Biden would rather spend talking about what he wants to accomplish as president. It also will put to the test the president's long-standing insistence he's turning the page from the Trump era and won't interfere with DOJ business. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Matthew Miller, a former director of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs during the Obama administration, said the White House should refer questions about the issue to DOJ and say they expect the attorney general to handle these matters ""free from the White House."" The focus on Giuliani has ""absolutely zero impact on Biden's ability to enact his agenda or govern,"" he said. When you're president, the point is not to seek attention but to get things done, he said. ""Well, I mean, if you're a normal president,"" he added, laughing. It's common for the DOJ to take big, controversial action that is separate from the president's policy agenda. That's one reason why DOJ is ""walled off"" from the White House on enforcement decisions, said Miller, now a partner at the strategic advisory firm Vianovo ""It's so they don't have to think about, 'If we do this, is it going to impact the president's policy agenda somehow?'"" Miller said. ""You want those decisions made independently."" Biden doesn't have any say over when DOJ takes enforcement action. It's possible that the Justice Department might have called the White House to give them a heads up that they were executing a search warrant that would draw headlines, he said. ""But I can't imagine the White House is worried they're not going to get enough attention for a speech that's going to be carried tonight on every network,"" he said. Miller also argued that Biden's work was already challenging when it came to finding support from Republicans, even without the Giuliani news. ""So what?"" he said. ""They're not going to support the agenda that they're all reflexively opposing anyway?""

115,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/650294290/0/indystar/crimeandcourts~Red-flag-law-expert-FedEx-shooting-example-of-devastating-effect-of-a-failure/,"A red flag law expert testifying in front of a US Senate subcommittee on Wednesday said the FedEx mass shooting that took place in Indianapolis two weeks ago shows the ""devastating effect of a failure"" when a state's red flag law is not fully invoked. Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, made the comments alongside testimony from four other witnesses hours before President Joe Biden was expected to urge lawmakers to adopt more restrictive gun control laws in his first address to Congress. Senators heard from the witnesses during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution as they mull over the prospect of creating federal grants that encourage states to enact red flag laws like those seen in Indiana and Connecticut. FedEx shooting:Who are the victims? ""Gun violence isn't inevitable,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said during the subcommittee hearing. ""Red flag statutes prove it."" Indiana's red flag law was a centerpiece of the debate after a 19-year-old gunman killed eight people at a FedEx Ground facility just outside the Indianapolis International Airport on April 15. ""Had an extreme risk order been obtained, eight families likely might not be grieving right now,"" Horwitz said, using another term to describe a red flag order from a judge. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears' office was indirectly criticized during the hearing as politicians and experts said they were curious to know why prosecutors did not pursue a red flag petition in court against the main suspect, Brandon Scott Hole, in 2020. IMPD seized a shotgun from Hole on March 3 of that year after his mother told officers he allegedly wanted to commit suicide by cop. When they visited Hole's residence law enforcement found evidence suggesting he had been looking at white supremacist websites online. ""In Indianapolis, had it been used, I think it could have saved those eight lives,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) Mears told reporters during a press conference April 19 that his office has 14 days to build a case strong enough to convince a judge that the individual should lose both the gun and their rights to purchase a gun. That isn't enough time, Mears said. FedEx Shooting: Marion County Prosecutor Mears criticized for not using red flag law Peg McLeish, Mears' chief of staff, also highlighted that red flag hearings determining that an individual is dangerous can be delayed months or even years, meaning had the petition been submitted against Hole there's no guarantee that he would have been prevented from purchasing a rifle in July 2020 and another in September 2020. Hole used those two rifles to carry out the April 15 shooting. In their list of initial gun control actions released April 7 the Biden-Harris administration said the Justice Department would publish model red flag legislation within 60 days to give states a roadmap to enact these laws. Biden is also pushing for a national red flag law, but Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Wednesday at the hearing they believe this should remain a state issue. Horwitz highlighted the red flag system in place in King County, Washington as a strong model worth replicating. In that county there is a unit dedicated to extreme risk protection orders, which includes ""law enforcement officers, prosecutors, a court advocate, a problem-solver, a court coordinator, a paralegal, a data technician, and a program manager,"" Horwitz said. ""These multidisciplinary teams work together to ensure the entire extreme risk order process is effective, timely, and just,"" he added. But Nikki Goeser, executive director of the Crime Prevention Research Center in Nashville, told lawmakers that there were ""devastating, unintended consequences"" these laws can have. Opinion: Letters: After FedEx shooting, blame the Red Flag law — not the prosecutor If Tennessee had a red flag law in place, the significant mental distress she experienced after her husband was murdered by a gunman could have led to her losing her firearms, which she wanted for self-defense. ""Even those with the best intentions could have an exaggerated concern and assume they were acting in my best interest, by having my guns taken from me,"" Goeser said.

117,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Qe-sdjeQYks/,"Below is the full text of President Joe Biden’s prepared address to Congress: Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan.
One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table
and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing:
Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now. We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water.
A clear and present danger to our children’s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us.
I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address –
this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans –
those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%.
We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has
never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber—attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.” After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform.
Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.” They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before
in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America.
That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.” In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. PoliticsCongressJoe Biden .

Related: Biden to make case for $1.8 trillion ‘American Families Plan’ in first speech to Congress — live blog Madame Speaker.Madame Vice President.No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time.The First Lady.The Second Gentleman.Mr. Chief Justice.Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests.My fellow Americans.While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in.Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world.To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities.Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity.About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy.And winning the future for America.As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration.100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis.The worst pandemic in a century.The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again.Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.Life can knock us down.But in America, we never stay down.In America, we always get up.And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew.Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness.After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff.We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again.We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America.100 days ago, America’s house was on fire.We had to act.And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act.Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan.One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.We’re already seeing the results.After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days.We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers.We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas.Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site.Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away.So get vaccinated now.When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected.Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%.And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot.At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like.She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope.A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease.She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home.When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried.Cried out of joy, cried out of relief.Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbyeIt means everything to both of them.There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now.But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen.What else have we done these first 100 days?We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households.We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door.It’s making a difference.For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.A single mom in Texas wrote to me.She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the tableand saved her and her son from eviction.A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money.One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk.Did you ever think you’d see that in America?That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already.We’re also providing:Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job.During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that.We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans.Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days.More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record.The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year.That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now.We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better.Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America.The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress.Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more.These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.The largest jobs plan since World War II.It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water.Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health.The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water.It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it.This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort.It creates jobs by building a modern power grid.Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms.The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers.2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children.800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits.For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis.Jobs. Jobs.For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs.The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes.Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways.Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on.And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.”American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs.The way it should be.Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing.Let me speak directly to you.Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come.These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree.75% do not require an associate’s degree.The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.And, it recognizes something I’ve always said.Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class.And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize.By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage.No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line.And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay.It’s long past time.Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record.We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years.And we’re falling behind in that competition.Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development.Today, we spend less than 1%.China and other countries are closing in fast.We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more.The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.This is personal to so many of us.I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our powerInvestments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support.Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan.And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal.So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas.But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option.We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children.That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education.When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world.But the world is catching up. They are not waiting.12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century.That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can.We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America.The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college.And then we add two years of free community college.And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions.Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort.Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care.We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child.And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families.In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6.With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family.This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year.Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address –this year – other critical priorities for America’s families.The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed.Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs.We all know how outrageously expensive they are.In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries.We can change that.Let’s do what we’ve always talked about.Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs.That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny.We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans.Let’s get it done this year.This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America.So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans?I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do.I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year.It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share.Just pay their fair share.A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year.No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits.A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands.And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.That’s not right.We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from.And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth.We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans –those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%.We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%.That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president.We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work.This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans.And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.That’s estimated to be billions of dollars.Look, I’m not out to punish anyone.But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough.What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy.When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut?Look at the big tax cut in 2017.It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth.Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit.It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs.In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make.The pandemic has only made things worse.20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans.At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion.Let me say that again.Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion.My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics hasnever worked.It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out.A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth.These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation.I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power.And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long?My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay.And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies.No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics.There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away.As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2.The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either.It’s a global fight.The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions.The rest of the world accounts for 85%.That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office.And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days.I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history.And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world.The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class.That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict.But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board.America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property.I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict.And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country.America is an idea – unique in the world.We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle.With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences.I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber—attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond.But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests.As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis.On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence.And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone.Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did.We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building.We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home.Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland.But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from.Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond.And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism.And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation.It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter.As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.”After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act.We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America.Now is our opportunity to make real progress.Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably.I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.My fellow Americans, we have to come together.To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve.To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system.And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already.I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats.We need to work together to find a consensus.Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death.The country supports this reform.Congress should act.We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice.Real justice.And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways.A chance to deliver real equity.Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water.Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations.Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American.I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long.I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible.I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans.To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back.And another thing.Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it.It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America.Pass it and save lives.And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America.Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead.250 shot dead.I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds.We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined.But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since.More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic.One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.”They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm.The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced.The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass a background check.Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon.But not anymore.I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence.But it’s time for Congress to act as well.We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun.And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again.Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon.They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to.These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners.The country supports reform, and the Congress should act.This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue.And here’s what else we can do.Immigration has always been essential to America.Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration.For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it.It’s time to fix it.On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress.If you believe we need a secure border – pass it.If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it.If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it.We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes.When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration.It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.Our plan worked.But the last administration shut it down.I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts.I have absolute confidence she will get the job done.Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on.Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home.And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster.As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history.The country supports immigration reform.Congress should act.And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote.More people voted in the last presidential election than ever beforein our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever.That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked.Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away.The country supports it.Congress should act.As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds.Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned.The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive.It did.But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent.As old as our Republic. Still vital today.Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people?Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart?America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t.They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage.They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong.We have to prove democracy still works.That our government still works – and can deliver for the people.In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver.We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives.Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice.That’s the essence of America.That’s democracy in action.Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”.It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I.Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over.It’s us. It’s “We the people.”In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part.That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part.And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.The autocrats will not win the future.America will.The future will belong to America.I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation.And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America.We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch.At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail.We came together.United.With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve.To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century.On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just.As one people. One nation. One America.It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.And it still isn’t.We are the United States of America.There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together.May God bless you all.May God protect our troops.  Rather than building charging stations or paying people to buy EVs, governments could do more to reduce emissions by just making gasoline cars and trucks more expensive.",2021-04-28 21:19:00,: Biden’s first speech to Congress: full text,,35170,https://www.marketwatch.com/

(Jim Watson/Pool via AP) | Jim Watson/Pool via AP By POLITICO STAFF 04/28/2021 09:28 PM EDT Link Copied These remarks are as prepared for delivery. Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now. We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber—attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.” After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.” They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.” In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.

The full text of his prepared speech below was released by the White House. Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans, While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything to both of them. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now. We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power. Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber— attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.” After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.” They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before &mldr and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.” In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.",2021-04-28 22:13:57,Read the full transcript from President Joe Biden's address to a joint session of Congress,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

""I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down,"" Biden said. ""But in America, we never stay down."" The president focused on goals he achieved during his first 100 days in office, a milestone he will pass on Friday. The benchmark, while arbitrary, has been a standard by which presidents have held themselves accountable for delivering on policy priorities since Franklin D. Roosevelt first coined the phrase. Here are some of the top takeaways from Biden’s address Wednesday: The week after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man whose death sparked waves of protest against racism and police brutality across the nation, Biden pushed for police reform. He urged Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which aims to bolster police accountability and ban certain maneuvers that have led to the deaths of Black Americans. “Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death,” Biden said. Floyd died after Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020. To applause, Biden said he believes the vast majority of law enforcement officials are good people who “serve their communities honorably,” but said systemic racism in the criminal justice system needs to be addressed. He recalled speaking with Floyd’s young daughter Gianna after his death. “As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye to eye, she said to me, ‘Daddy changed the world,’” he said. “After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if – if we have the courage to act.” For the first time in history, two women stood behind the president as he delivered a joint address to Congress. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman to be elected to that position, stood alongside Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the first woman elected as speaker in 2007. “Madam speaker, madam vice president,” Biden said when he arrived at the podium. “No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time.” The two women greeted each other with an elbow bump when they arrived, a standard greeting during the coronavirus pandemic. They each wore a mask during Biden’s address. Women serving in Congress told USA TODAY that having Harris and Pelosi in those seats is a historic moment and an important example of representation of women in leadership roles. ""It’s critical that girls across the country see women at the highest levels of government and know that they too can serve as vice president and speaker of the House,"" said Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, the first woman from Wyoming elected to the Senate. Biden pressed lawmakers to take urgent action on gun violence in the country, which he called an “epidemic,” in the wake of multiple deadly shootings this year. He asked Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, recalling his efforts to do so in 1994 as a senator from Delaware. He called for the passage of two House bills, aimed at strengthening background checks on gun purchases, that don’t have enough support from Republicans in the Senate to pass in the evenly divided chamber. He also urged the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act aimed at reducing domestic and sexual violence. The law includes a provision preventing people convicted of abusing dating partners from buying or owning guns. “It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America,” Biden said. “Pass it and save lives.” The president recognized the victims of recent mass shootings, and promised that he would do everything in his power to “protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence.” He urged Republicans and Democrats to work together on passing gun control legislation. “Our flag at the White House was still flying at half staff for the eight victims of the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado,” Biden said. “In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead.” Biden urged Congress to raise taxes on the rich and corporations, saying they need to pay their fair share. “I’m not looking to punish anyone,” he said. “What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible.” In his plea to lawmakers, Biden has said that raising the taxes on the wealthy would pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, a sweeping package that includes paid family leave, free community college, subsidized child care and other proposals to expand the nation’s social safety net. Biden again said that he would not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. “They’re already paying enough,” he said. Immigration has shrouded Biden’s first 100 days, as his administration has struggled to deal with a dramatic increase of migrant children, families and single adults at the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president didn’t focus on the border challenges his administration faced Wednesday night. Instead, he focused on urging Congress to pass his comprehensive immigration legislation, which would create a pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million people living in the United States without citizenship. “If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, take a close look at it,” Biden said of his immigration bill. Biden also noted that if Congress doesn’t pass his bill, he would like to see them pass some sort of immigration legislation that would create a pathway for at least Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipients, farmworkers and protections for those with temporary protected status. “The country supports immigration reform. Let’s act,"" Biden said Biden also highlighted the vice president's role in addressing the root causes of why migrants from Central America are coming to the United States. “We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador,” Biden said, adding that they restarted a program that would give aid to the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. “When I was vice president, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.” Biden celebrated his administration passing its goal of delivering 200 million COVID-19 vaccines in his first 100 days in office, calling the ongoing vaccination effort one of the greatest ""logistical achievements this country has ever seen. He urged all Americans to get a vaccine, noting everyone over the age of 16 is now eligible to receive one. “Go get vaccinated, America, go and get the vaccination. They’re available,” he said. Biden said that over 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. More: Biden blazed past his vaccine target for the first 100 days. Does the Trump administration deserve credit too? He took credit for the increase in the availability of vaccines and the vaccinations given to the most vulnerable, noting that 1% of seniors had been vaccinated when he took office and now over 70% are “fully protected.” “Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January,” he said, adding that over half of all American adults have received at least one dose. The coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 32 million and caused the deaths of nearly 575,000 people in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins.",2021-04-28 22:17:34,"Police reform, banning assault weapons, looking beyond COVID-19: Takeaways from Joe Biden's address to Congress",,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

                    Associated Press President Joe Biden used his first address before a joint session of Congress to make the case that his administration has made progress during the first 100 days he’s been in office, confronting the public health and economic maelstrom caused by coronavirus pandemic. Read Biden’s full remarks below: The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now. We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school — not day care — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans – protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyberattacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.” After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.” They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol — desecrating our democracy — remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis — a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.” In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Left:

Advertisement Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President.
RELATED Biden's first 100 days: Action on COVID-19, immigration and return to world stage No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it's about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman.
RELATED In first speech to Congress, Biden touts Families Plan, COVID-19 response Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet - and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans.
RELATED Biden's families plan would tax rich, invest in children, education While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different - a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis - and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation - and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight - just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis.
Advertisement The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America's house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer - and with the overwhelming support of the American people - Democrats, Independents, and Republicans - we did act. Together - we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days - we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days.
Advertisement We're marshalling every federal resource. We've gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We're setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone - is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it's like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids' faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.
Advertisement Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you - the American people - our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making a difference. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn't work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor - something she put off for months because she didn't have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk.
Advertisement Did you ever think you'd see that in America? That's why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger - and hunger is down sharply already. We're also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We're making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.
Advertisement America is moving. Moving forward. And we can't stop now. We're in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed The American Jobs Plan - a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It's clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water.
Advertisement A clear and present danger to our children's health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child - can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don't have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures - with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn't get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.
Advertisement This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There's no reason the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs - jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: ""Buy American."" American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now - I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.
Advertisement You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that's rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate's degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I've always said. Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act - the PRO Act - and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way - let's also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It's long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record.
Advertisement We will see more technological change in the next 10 years - than we saw in the last 50 years. And we're falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA - the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - that's there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security - which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH - should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs - to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we're talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan.
Advertisement And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let's get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn't waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can't be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families - in our children. That's why I'm introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That's why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America - starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America.
Advertisement The research shows that when a young child goes to school-not day care-they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us - and she'll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one - a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families.
Advertisement In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 - and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that's up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let's extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address - this year - other critical priorities for America's families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans -protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women's health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let's lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America - nearly three times as much as other countries.
Advertisement We can change that. Let's do what we've always talked about. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won't just help people on Medicare - it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act - expand Medicare coverage and benefits - without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We've talked about it long enough - Democrats and Republicans. Let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I've made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let's start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits.
Advertisement A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That's not right. We're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share - and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we're going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans - those making $400,000 or more - back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans - those making $400,000 or more - back up to 39.6%. That's where it was when George W. Bush became president. We're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That's estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I'm not out to punish anyone.
Advertisement But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They're already paying enough. What I've proposed is fair. It's fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I've proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America - ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development - it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic - working- and middle-class Americans.
Advertisement At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists - left, right, center - agree that what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I've often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example - not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders - many I've known for a long time - the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back - but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren't going it alone - we're going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone - from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change - and as we're experiencing now, pandemics.
Advertisement There's no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs - and we are meeting them - we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries - just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It's a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That's why - I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world - from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet - and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I've proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class.
Advertisement That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition - and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe - not to start conflict - but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I've said to many world leaders - that America won't back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea - unique in the world. We are all created equal. It's who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don't seek escalation, their actions have consequences.
Advertisement I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia's interference in our elections and cyber-attacks on our government and businesses - and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms - and as we're working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America's security and world security - we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking of nation-building.
Advertisement We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake - the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined - the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye-to-eye, she said to me, ""Daddy changed the world.""
Advertisement After the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was - if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways.
Advertisement A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans - Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94-1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we've seen this past year - and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home - especially the young people who are so brave - I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let's reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so-called ""boyfriend"" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It's estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner - every month in America.
Advertisement Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half-staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000's, that law expired and we've seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know - the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence - I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so-called ""ghost guns."" They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm.
Advertisement The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it's time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines again. Don't tell me it can't be done. We've done it before ... and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters - they'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds - 100 bullets - in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn't be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people - including many gun owners.
Advertisement The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn't be a Red vs. Blue issue. It's an American issue. And here's what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It's time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border - pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship - pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem - I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked.
Advertisement But the last administration shut it down. I'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won't pass my plan - let's at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers - the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man-made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic - as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America - we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history - in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it's being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away.
Advertisement The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol-desecrating our democracy-remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis-a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us - created equal in the image of God - have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America's adversaries - the autocrats of the world - are betting it can't. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works.
Advertisement That our government still works - and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people's faith in our democracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the nation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That's the essence of America. That's democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, ""We the People"". It's time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It's us. It's ""We the people."" In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us-In America: we do our part. That's all I'm asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation.
Advertisement And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy - of pandemic and pain - and ""We the People"" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It's never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn't. We are the United States of America. There is nothing - nothing - beyond our capacity - nothing we can't do - if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.",2021-04-28 23:21:32,Full text: President Joe Biden's first address before Congress,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images/Pool Opinion by JEFF GREENFIELD 04/28/2021 11:00 PM EDT Link Copied Jeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author. By many measures, President Joe Biden was facing serious headwinds as he delivered his first speech to Congress. There would be no full chamber, no ceremonial grandeur, no forum for a president to deploy all the theater of a packed house, bringing his supporters to their feet over and over again with sustained cheers. He wouldn’t have an audience to stir up with stentorian rhetoric or stacked applause lines. There would be no “Skutniks”—those “regular Americans” introduced to Congress and the nation from the gallery, chosen to symbolize heroism or to tug the heartstrings for a major policy. And with all that missing—in fact, because it was missing—Biden managed one of the most striking presidential addresses to Congress in memory. His speech was delivered almost as conversation, rather than a series of declamations. He kept his voice, for long stretches, at times a near-whisper of empathy or concern—a tone that would have been completely unworkable in a full room. And this wasn’t just when he talked about the pain of the pandemic, but when he turned to the challenge of an autocratic China, or grand-sounding rhetoric like a “great inflection point in history.” His economic policy was detailed in the tones of voice you might use to address a small gathering at the White House. Even when he turned to the ill-gotten gains of the very rich, he used a “just the facts” mode. “A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands,” he said, “And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.” The substance of the message wasn’t that different from what Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren offered, far more loudly, during the presidential campaign. But—to borrow from the right wing’s fantasy about Biden’s dietary plans—there was a lot less rhetorical red meat. At times, as when he was talking about the victims of gun violence, it was as if the case he was making was emotional enough to stand on its own: “Our flag at the White House was still flying at half-staff for the eight victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead.” And when he turned to the George Floyd case, he spoke the most powerful of images—“We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America”—almost in a whisper. He gained momentum, and volume, when he started talking about issues like equality and democracy—a different kind of moment than other presidents have chosen to emphasize. Overall, he approached it with the tone of a leader in a time of national crisis, the political mood that carried Biden into office, and the one he will have to sustain if he has any hope of pushing through the kind of ambitious, expensive changes the speech outlines. It has been observed that Biden’s own experience of loss, and his ability to project empathy, is his own political “X factor,” and the quietness of the room let him project that empathy in a way it’s hard to imagine another president, any other year, being able to do. This tone also served Biden well when he recounted the early successes of his first 100 days—a way to be serious, and even take something of a victory lap, without disrespect to everyone still suffering. In the absence of celebratory triumph, the quiet tone was itself a message that we are in the middle of a journey, with work to be done. In a larger sense, the toned-down evening was a gift not just to the president, but to those of us watching as well. In the absence of the endless calisthenics of a normal State of the Union—the standing ovations, the compulsory cheers, the opposition party staying stubbornly seated—it gave viewers a chance to focus on the speech itself. If it resembled less the semi-royal occasions these events have turned into, dripping with pomp and circumstance, it was a more agreeable, more accessible—maybe even more “American”—occasion. One more subtle springboard that Biden got: Speaker Nancy Pelosi began by saying she had the “distinct honor, the high privilege” of introducing the president of the United States.” She did not use those words last year.

128,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/INqyPaTOspI/,"During his April 28, 2021, speech to Congress, President Biden called for a ban on “high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds.” He reiterated his point seconds later, saying: We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. Biden also called for an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, and new regulations on guns that are built from parts kits. He described gun violence as an “epidemic” and called for Republicans to join Democrats in supporting gun control. Biden said, “We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun.” Biden referenced the March 22, 2021, mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado. He did not mention that Colorado has universal background checks, but those checks did nothing to hinder, much less stop, the Boulder attacker from carrying out his heinous act. He referenced gun violence in America that is under-reported because it does not fall under the moniker of a mass shooting. He did not mention that much of this violence occurs in Democrat-controlled cities like Chicago and New York City, both of which are heavily gun-controlled, yet riddled with violence.

President Joe Biden gives remarks to Congress Wednesday evening as he prepares to mark 100 days in office President Joe Biden gave his first speech to a Joint Session of Congress on Wednesday night. As a Democrat, there were many things I liked about his speech. In addition to the president’s temperament and his soft-spoken delivery, it was refreshing to hear someone who had the bravery to describe white supremacy as what it really is -- domestic terrorism and to let the trans youth in the LGBTQ community know that he has his back. It was also refreshing to hear a president praise the other political party, Republicans, for legislation they are putting forth on areas where he felt there could be bipartisan support; and for two people to be seated behind the president who were both women. Yes, it took 245 years to get here, but it happened.

      (AP) Overall, the president delivered a message about hope and the possibilities that can happen when we work together. As a Democratic strategist here are my top three favorite proposals that President Biden put forth in his speech on Wednesday night. BIDEN LAYS OUT VISION FOR 'REBUILDING' AMERICA THROUGH SLEW OF POLICY PROPOSALS IN FIRST JOINT ADDRESS Like many Americans, I favor the American Jobs Plan and love the idea of building the things our country needs in Pittsburgh rather than Beijing. I also love the American Families Plan, which most Americans support, especially Universal Pre-K and Paid Family Leave. But my three favorite Biden proposals were all in areas that I feel need the most attention. Here’s my list: VOTING RIGHTS After the last presidential election last year in November, there have been battles in various states and within both parties about voting.  Some, on the right, think there was widespread voter fraud (although not proven) and want to make voting more difficult.  There are currently 361 bills nationwide supported by Republicans which many, especially on the left, view as voter suppression bills. President Biden spoke of the urgency on Wednesday night with regard to voter rights. He said: ""If we are to truly restore the soul of America -- we need to protect the sacred right to vote."" Shouldn’t voting be a right and something we celebrate not attack? Two ways that can be done are for Congress to pass the For the People Act (HR1)  and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act (HR4) Together, these bills would restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1964, expand voter registration, voter access, limit removing voters from the voter rolls, establish independent redistricting commissions, sets forth provisions to improve election security and address campaign finance. WHAT'S IN BIDEN'S $2.25T TAX AND INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN? Passing these two pieces of legislation would certainly be getting into the ""Good Trouble"" that John Lewis the late civil rights activist and longtime member of Congress spoke of. GUN CONTROL There have been 147 mass shootings this year. That means more than 1 mass shooting per day has occurred in 2021. President Biden said: ""I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well."" He went on to say, ""This should not be a red or blue issue…this is an American issue.""  And he is right. Nationwide voters are nearly united in support for expanded background checks.  According to a Morning Consult poll, 84% of voters, including 77% of Republicans, support requiring all gun purchasers to go through a background check. And a majority support bans on high-capacity magazines (64%) and assault-style weapons (63%). CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER As the president said (my favorite line of the night), ""You think deer are wearing Kevlar vests?"" The president is right, Congress needs to act; this has the support of the voters. POLICE REFORM According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 6 in 10 Americans say the country should do more to hold police accountable for mistreatment of Black people. President Biden spoke of images most of us will never forget saying: ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is the opportunity to make real progress on this issue. The vast majority of those wearing the badge serve our communities honorably. I know they want to help meet this moment as well."" He went on to say: ""If we have the courage to act, to rebuild trust, root out systemic racism we can enact police reform in George Floyd’s name by the first anniversary of his death."" The poll cited above not only shows that most Americans support greater scrutiny of police but it also finds concerns over the treatment of Black Americans and other minorities by the criminal justice system.  Those have been concerns dating back to 1988, but they have spiked after Floyd’s murder. I enjoyed the president’s speech on Wednesday night, liked his ideas and proposals and have already outlined my top three above. But here’s what else I liked… I liked how Biden spoke of action versus inaction. ""Doing nothing is not an option,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And I liked that the president reminded us how great we are: ""It’s never ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t. We’re the United States of America…we can do whatever we set our minds to if we do it together.  So let’s begin to get together. … America is an idea-unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle."" Those words gave me hope because the president reminded us of who we are and what truly is possible when we come together as a nation.

Current | Bio | Archive U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas got a wish granted this week when the court agreed to hear a Second Amendment case. And even by agreeing to take up the case, liberals displayed their own hypocrisy on gun rights issues. The Supreme Court announced Monday that it would hear New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Corlett. It challenges New York state’s concealed carry law that requires a showing of need in order to obtain a license to carry. Petitioners believe that self-defense when outside the home provides a sufficient demonstration of need. The court said arguments will be limited to the question of ""whether the State’s denial of petitioners’ applications for concealed-carry licenses for self-defense violated the Second Amendment."" Slate staff writer Mark Stern claimed that the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case will leave Democrats with a decision of their own. ""  . . .  Democrats now have a clear choice between two concrete options,"" he said: ""Allow SCOTUS to knock down state and local restrictions on concealed public carry in the midst of endless mass shootings, or expand the court."" Jezebel writer Ashley Reese made a similar argument. ""The timing couldn’t be more ghoulish. The United States has seen a spike in mass shootings in 2021, averaging more than one mass shooting each day."" she wrote. ""Most Americans favor stricter gun control laws, but conservatives are salivating over the prospect of making their flawed fantasy a reality: More so-called ‘good guys’ with guns, ready and willing to stop the 'bad guys.'"" When Stern and Reese claim the United States is witnessing an uptick in ""endless mass shootings,"" they’re actually making the argument in favor of concealed carry. If mass shootings are as common as they’d have their readers believe, then the need for law-abiding citizens to carry their own weapons for self-protection is elevated. The court’s decision also appalled Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. ""New York’s nation-leading gun violence prevention laws . . . have made us the safest big state in the nation,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""This NRA-backed case is a massive threat to that security. Imagine someone carrying a gun through Times Square, onto the subway, or to a tailgate outside of a Bills game."" First of all, people are already ""carrying a gun through Times Square, onto the subway, or to a tailgate outside of a Bills game."" With the exception of law enforcement officers, those people are likely criminals. And just like the previous examples, ordinary law-abiding citizens should have the ability to protect themselves from those criminals. Finally, New York is hardly ""the safest big state in the nation"" — not since New York City joined the throng of jurisdictions that decided to defund police. ""We think defunding police is the right thing to do,"" said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as the city diverted some $1 billion in police funds to other programs. One of the casualties was the 600-officer anti-crime unit. As a result, murder rates in all five boroughs increased and the city saw a 130% jump in shootings in 2020 as compared to the previous year. As of March 31, New York recorded 84 homicides, up 13% during the first three months of 2020. And Cuomo himself isn’t against this ""defund the police"" madness. ""When they’re saying 'defund the police,'"" he told reporters, ""they’re saying they want fundamental change when it comes to policing. And they’re right."" But Cuomo doesn’t have to worry. As governor he enjoys the protection of armed security. Rep. Alexandrea Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., along with the other three members of her democratic socialist ""squad,"" also support defunding police. They also support stringent gun control laws. Yet they spend thousands of dollars on private armed security, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That’s great if you can afford it, but the only means of defense for the average Joe is to take training in the use and safety of firearms, submit to a stringent background check, and purchase and carry a weapon. Justice Thomas has been chomping at the bit for years to hear a good Second Amendment case. Last year he observed that the court had only taken up a single gun rights case since 2011. "" . . .  it seems highly unlikely that the Court would allow a State to enforce a law requiring a woman to provide a justifiable need before seeking an abortion,"" he said at the time. ""But today, faced with a petition challenging just such a restriction on citizens' Second Amendment rights, the Court simply looks the other way."" The fact that the court agreed to hear a new Second Amendment issue should give all conservatives cause to rejoice. The only thing better would be if the decision, when it comes, begins with the phrase, ""Justice Thomas delivers the Opinion of the Court."" Michael Dorstewitz is a retired lawyer and has been a frequent contributor to BizPac Review and Liberty Unyielding. He is also a former U.S. Merchant Marine officer and an enthusiastic Second Amendment supporter, who can often be found honing his skills at the range.

          / CBS News Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it's about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America's house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan.One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We're already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We're marshalling every federal resource. We've gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We're setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it's like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids' faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It's making a difference. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn't work, this relief check put food on the tableand saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn't have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you'd see that in America? That's why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We're also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We're making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can't stop now. We're in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That's why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It's clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children's health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don't have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn't get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There's no reason the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: ""Buy American."" American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that's rapidly changing. I want to speak speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate's degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I've always said. Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let's also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It's long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we're falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that's there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us.I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we're talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let's get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn't waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi. Spent over 24 hours in private discussions. When he called to congratulate, we had a two hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming most significant consequential nation in the world. He ant others, autocrats, think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century. It takes too long to get consensus. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That's why I'm introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. My American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. A great university in this country conducted studies of the last 10 years that shows adding two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old, no matter what background they come from, puts them in a position of being able to compete all the way through 12 years.     The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she'll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. I'm proposing legislation that would guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that's up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let's extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America's families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women's health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let's lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let's do what we've always talked about for all of years I was down here in this body.    Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won't just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. It's within our power to do it. Let's do it now.    We've talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I've made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let's start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That's not right. We're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we're going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That's where it was when George W. Bush became president. We're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That's estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I'm not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They're already paying enough. What I've proposed is fair. It's fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I've proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics hasnever worked. It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I've often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I've known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren't going it alone – we're going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we're experiencing now, pandemics. There's no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It's a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That's why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I've proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I've said to many world leaders – that America won't back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It's who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don't seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia's interference in our elections and cyber—attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we're working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America's security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. If you've been to the upper valley, you've seen the gates of hell. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.    After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, ""Daddy changed the world."" After the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death. The country supports this reform.Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, White, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we've seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let's reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called ""boyfriend"" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It's estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000's, that law expired and we've seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called ""ghost guns."" They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it's time for Congress to act as well. I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don't tell me it can't be done. We've done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn't be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn't be a Red vs. Blue issue. It's an American issue. And here's what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let's end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It's time to fix it. On Day One of my presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won't pass my plan – let's at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it's being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America's adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can't. I promise you, they're betting we can't. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage.  They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people's faith in our democracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the nation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That's the essence of America. That's democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, ""We the People"". It's time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It's us. It's ""We the people."" In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That's all I'm asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and ""We the People"" did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It's never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn't. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can't do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.

132,https://townhall.com/columnists/armstrongwilliams/2021/04/29/mass-shootings-pandemic-n2588698,"Source: AP Photo/Lisa Marie Pane Growing up in rural South Carolina on my family's farm, I developed a love, appreciation and, most importantly, a respect for firearms. To this day, I remain a collector of firearms and a supporter of the American right to keep and bear arms as enshrined in the Second Amendment. I was taught that safety is paramount to gun ownership, so I have always encouraged responsible gun ownership and use for all Americans. With that being said, I have noticed a disturbing trend in our country: an ever-increasing number of shootings and gun-related deaths. And while the quick response from some, namely the left-wing mainstream media and liberal politicians, is to ban weapons and become more restrictive, it appears to me that we have serious mental health and poverty issues contributing to gun violence. I don't believe that banning guns will result in any significant decline in shootings attributed to these two categories. In the United States, since January 2021, we have had 195 mass shootings, with 245 people dying and approximately 731 wounded, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. While it's important to acknowledge that there is not a universally accepted definition of what constitutes a ""mass shooting,"" these numbers are staggering. They are some of the highest numbers in the industrialized world. Let's contrast 2021 with when I was growing up, when mass shootings simply weren't a problem. I believe that this is the direct result of the era and the family structure: Parents were involved in their children's lives and children were taught discipline and respect. By and large, members of my generation were raised in households with two parents, and we were taught how to deescalate and talk things out when problems arose. Today, that no longer seems to be the case. We have a moral and social failing in our country that has caused an increase in mass shooters, predominantly young men. One has to pause to think about what's different today from 30 or 40 years ago. It certainly isn't guns, because it's harder to get guns today than it was in the past, when you didn't have to go through nationalized background checks. When I was growing up, you could purchase a firearm with no questions asked, yet we didn't see so many mass shootings. America's young men are struggling with mental health issues or are broken and living in poverty with single mothers struggling to survive. Many of them are clearly crying out for help, and we owe it to them to listen. Mental illness in this country has been stigmatized for far too long, so much so that many families are unwilling to confront their own past with it and certainly aren't willing to acknowledge what their children may be experiencing. But even the families that recognize mental health issues might not have the resources or the know-how to get the proper help. This could all be changed at the federal level through more funding for treatment of mental illness. We also need program funding at the state and local level to assist schools with recognizing these signs early so that necessary steps can be taken to mitigate potential violence. Another important facet of this dialogue is religion. I know we don't often talk about religion these days, but it instills moral and ethical values that are key to a society's success. It creates boundaries that inform us of what is good and what is bad. Many of the greatest thinkers known to man have talked about the importance of morality and ethics for all civilized people, how they are key to a good life and setting boundaries against bad behavior. We often hear or read arguments from the left about inner cities, such as Baltimore or Chicago, being examples of violence run amuck that highlight the need for more gun control. However, proponents of these measures don't always want to deal with poverty, family breakdown, education or economic opportunities. When people are better educated, financially secure and are happy with their family life and their community outlook, they are more likely to be constructive members of society and less likely to go down a dangerous path. Today, there is clearly a lack of pride, security, belonging and ownership that is so fundamental to continued success of any society. If we start focusing on those things and truly tackle them without making excuses or trying to blame everything on the system, I am confident that we may actually be able to solve the root of the problem. We can acknowledge that we have a problem in our country with gun-related deaths and the young men who typically carry out such heinous acts. But with that discussion comes the responsibility to take a nuanced approach to finding the root of the problem. I can assure you that simply banning guns won't solve this multifaceted problem. Tackling mental illness and the problems in our inner cities are the exact steps we should be looking to take.

133,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/650337466/0/indystar/todaystopstories~Four-minutes-at-FedEx-Inside-the-terror-of-Indianapolis-deadliest-mass-shooting-in-years/,"Jaswinder Singh was ready for work at the FedEx Ground-Plainfield Operation Center at 2:30 p.m. Three hours before his shift was set to start, he sat dressed in black tracksuit pants, dress shoes, a T-shirt and his burgundy turban. ""Dad,"" Singh's son, Gurinder, chided, ""it’s too early for you."" It was was a big day for the 68-year-old who moved to Indiana in 2018 to be near his son's family. Singh didn't need to work, but liked to stay active. So he started at FedEx the week before. That day, April 15, Singh was going to receive his first paycheck from his first job in the United States. As he waited, Singh enjoyed one of his favorite lunches — chapatis, a flat bread, with vegetables and yogurt. He finished it all off with a cup of warm milk, which he started drinking after his doctor advised him drinking too much tea was not good for his health. Singh's wife planned to cook more chapatis for dinner for when he returned from work. But for now, he grabbed an apple and a bottle of water. Then Singh climbed into the car with Rajwinder Kaur, a neighbor and another FedEx employee, to report to work for their shift that would end around 11 p.m. As their shift winded down about 10:30 p.m., the mammoth package handling facility spanning an area the size of nearly seven football fields was a hive of activity. Second-shift workers like Singh prepared to leave as more than 100 others arrived to spend the overnight hours sorting packages and loading trucks. And because it was payday, others were arriving to claim their checks at a counter just inside the warehouse’s main entrance. At 10:45, Surinder Kaur decided to wait for the line to go down before collecting her paycheck. While she waited, she ate dinner with four co-workers in an area near a gate manned by security guards. Karli Smith checked in with her family from the busy center at 10:59 p.m. The 2020 graduate of George Washington High School was finishing her second week on the job. Like Singh, she, too, had just earned her first paycheck. In the bustle, the arrival of another car in the unsecured parking lot on the north side of the warehouse drew no scrutiny. It was more of the routine ebb and flow, just like every other night at the FedEx facility near the Indianapolis International Airport. The car's driver — Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old former employee who last worked at in October — parked and stepped out of the car wielding two assault rifles. He soon started shooting. Eight lay dead minutes later from the spray of gunfire. Several others were wounded and hurt in the chaos. The carnage lasted less than four minutes, but for many the staccato crack of gunfire that night will reverberate for a lifetime. ► More coverage: Even in a year of so much death, FedEx shooting is hard for coroner's workers to bear IndyStar interviewed dozens of workers, police officers, analyzed dispatcher calls and law enforcement to reconstruct the timeline of the April 15 mass shooting at FedEx. The massacre was Indianapolis' worst mass shooting in at least 15 years, but the third already in 2021. Unlike the other two, this one played out not in a home, among people who knew each other, but in a workplace full of strangers. Many questions remain unanswered, most notably Hole’s motive and whether any of the victims were targeted, the latter prompted by the fact that four of the victims were Sikhs, who make up a large part of the center's workforce. But for now, at least, it appears the line between life and death was random. A matter of timing, location and luck. Bad luck and good. Hole isn’t around to provide any answers. As quickly as the shooting started it was over, with Hole dead on the warehouse floor after taking his own life. Police say he left no indication of what triggered the deadly shooting spree. What is known is that Hole had come to the attention of Indianapolis police just a year earlier. They confiscated a .410 shotgun after his mother reported on March 3, 2020, that Hole had recently purchased the gun and threatened “suicide by cop.” After the FedEx slaughter, Hole's family apologized and said this. “We are devastated at the loss of life caused as a result of Brandon’s actions,"" a statement read; ""through the love of his family, we tried to get him the help he needed."" In March of last year after police visited him, Hole was taken to a local hospital for evaluation and was released hours later. Though Indianapolis Metropolitan Police officers discovered Hole had visited white supremacist websites, FBI Indianapolis Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said an interview with the teen revealed no “Racially Motivated Violent Extremism (RMVE) ideology” at the time, and there was nothing on his computer to ""initiate any type of legal federal process."" Still, Indianapolis police remained concerned enough that they asked the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office to review Hole’s case for a possible “red flag” action. It would allow authorities to keep the shotgun and prevent Hole, at least temporarily, from buying other guns. The prosecutor’s office declined to pursue the proactive legal maneuver. Hole's family agreed to let police keep the shotgun, but Hole soon purchased two even more powerful assault-style rifles. He legally bought a HM Defense HM15F in July, and a Ruger AR-556 in September 2020. Police said Hole was armed with these two guns when he stepped out of his car at FedEx about 11 p.m. that night and began shooting. ► 'He was cut loose': Indiana red flag law was not used for FedEx shooter The first 911 calls lit up phones at the Marion County Sheriff’s Office 911 Call Center a little after 11 p.m. Over the next few minutes, dispatchers took 96 frantic reports. Olivia Thla Sui had wanted to leave work early. But it was her turn to drive her friend to work. So she stayed until the end of their shift, clocking out around 10:40 p.m. She got her check and exited the secured work area into the locker room, the main room that workers enter before swiping their badges to get past security guards. The two walked out to her car, which faces the building in the second row. Sui had just turned on the interior light so she could use her phone to deposit her paycheck when she heard the first round of gunfire. She and her friend wondered: what kind of event is going on that requires fireworks? ""But then that's when I saw a man with a gun running into a building, as I was looking around,"" Sui said. ""And I thought I was seeing things, but then I heard multiple gunshots right after he entered the building."" Sui's fight-or-flight instinct kicked in: she threw her car into reverse and fled. ""If we had even been late, for what, like even 30-40 seconds,"" she said, ""I, I don't know what would have happened to us."" Nearby, Rajwinder Kaur cowered in her mustard-colored car as bullets flew. Her car was struck five times, according to an account provided by Gurinder Singh. Jaswinder Singh, who carpooled to work with her earlier in the evening, was still in the building. Surinder Kaur and co-workers also thought they were hearing fireworks as they ate. But when other coworkers started screaming and running, they realized the sounds were gunfire. She said the gunman shot people through the gate. “The rest of us,"" she said, ""left our stuff behind and decided to hide.” Kaur first ran into a room with others, but feared the gunman could find them there. So they scurried to the human resources office. The door was locked. “We all told them to please open the door,"" she recalled, ""but they were scared, too.” ► 15 'agonizing' hours: Why FedEx victims' families waited so long to learn loved ones' fate ► 'Let's come together': Families call for unity, stricter gun laws at FedEx shooting vigils One woman suggested they run to the bathroom. Kaur remembers at least 20 people huddling there, many hiding inside the stalls. “People were scared and were hoping the shooter wouldn’t come in,” she said. Kaur, terrified, folded her hands and prayed. “Waheguru, Waheguru,” she said, which translates to “wonderful teacher” and is often chanted in Sikhism as a reference to a higher power. Calls for help continued to come in to the 911 center. Some were from employees in their cars in the parking lot. One was from a bathroom where the frightened workers hid. Police radio traffic reflected the chaos and scope of the tragedy as officers and emergency medical personnel raced to the scene. At 11:08 p.m., an officer overheard on his police radio that a woman in a control room at FedEx said they could still hear shots. ""She does not have a visual but can hear the shots."" ""We have many units en route,"" another officer reported about 11:13 p.m. More than 100 officers ultimately responded to the emergency calls. Less than 10 minutes later, multiple medics  arrived. ""Advise Eskenazi we'll have multiple patients. Advise them to be ready,"" an officer reported. ""Advise St. Vincent."" Then came more grim news. ""Control, we got another one down behind the building,"" an officer exclaimed as he arrived at the scene. As police stormed the building, one called over the line at 11:22 p.m. ""We've got the suspect here inside. Looks like he's got a gunshot wound to the head. 10-0. Two rifles here,"" one officer said, referencing the police code for someone who is dead. ""Unless there's another person out, this is going to be our suspect here."" About 20 minutes after the first calls for help, the worst mass shooting in recent years in Indianapolis is over. The full picture of the tragedy slowly emerged. Four dead inside. Four dead outside. Five others wounded.  Keys, purses, paperwork and lunchboxes strewn everywhere. About 1:30 a.m., Mike Weisert got a call from his mother. It had been over two hours since her husband, Steve, was supposed to return home from his shift. He drove to FedEx with his partner, only to be intercepted by police. They were redirected to the Holiday Inn on Stansted Drive. That's where police had quickly established a family reunification center. IMPD chaplains and other support staff rushed to the hotel to assist families. The first families arrived within 10 minutes. Some went home relieved, others devastated. As they waited in that hotel room, the air was filled with hope and fear. One man held a cellphone in his right hand, cradling a sleeping child in his left arm. By 2 a.m., the hotel was packed. Over the next 12 hours, the families searching for loved ones suffered through a range of emotions: fear, anxiety, exhaustion. ""The quiet was so loud it was intense,” remembered Vanessa Waters, who arrived at the hotel on Friday morning looking for her friend. “You could see it in the eyes: a look I’ve never seen before.” Ashlee Floyd, whose father missed his customary 11:25 p.m. check-in at home and didn’t answer his wife’s calls, is there in the gray pajamas she wore to bed. She got a phone call from her nephew in New Mexico who had seen news of the shooting on TV. Floyd grabbed her keys, her purse, the first shoes she saw and went to find her father. ""I don’t know if he’s OK. I don’t know if he’s injured. I don’t know if he’s gone,” she said. “I’m just scared right now.” At times, the scene inside the Holiday Inn’s ballroom is nothing short of “chaos,” other family members said. Ashley Ladd, who had already learned her daughter was OK via FaceTime, arrived to pick her up and lend support to the family of her daughter’s friends. They included FedEx workers Karli Smith and Samaria Blackwell. “It was a lot scarier for the other families than it was for me because I knew my daughter was okay,” she said. “I knew she was coming home.” So Ladd did what she could to comfort her friend, Smith’s mother, as she waited. The minutes turned into hours, but still no word. Meanwhile, Gurinder Singh turned on his phone. It's after 2 a.m. and he was at work on break when he first saw a Google News alert about a shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility on Mirabel Road. He called his mom and told her to call Rajwinder Kaur, who drove his father to work. No one answered the landline phone, so Gurinder Singh looked for another number to call. Gurinder Singh finally reached Rajwinder Kaur's son at 4 a.m. Rajwinder Kaur, the son told him, was home — safe. She didn't know about his father. So after 4:15 a.m., Gurinder drove to the FedEx Ground facility. ""I see some Indian people over there,"" he said, ""they told me my dad's no more. Still, I can't believe it."" ► The following week: Sikhs in Indiana demand accountability from FedEx, police after shooting By Friday afternoon, as a nation growing increasingly weary of mass shootings turned its focus on Indianapolis, the group waiting at the Holiday Inn dwindled in size. President Biden lamented the tragedy and ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff. Mike Weisert, meanwhile, stood in the hotel parking lot, visibly worried. At that point, he'd been up all night with his mother waiting for word of his father, Steve. ""We're just desperately waiting for some kind of answer or absolution of the situation,"" he said. At 2 p.m., roughly 14 hours after Brandon Hole drove to FedEx, Weisert's family is just one of four still waiting for answers. ""What's going to happen?"" he asked. ""Is he gone? Are we going to see him again?"" The answer was what they feared. His father was among the dead. Gurinder Singh remembered being called into a room at the hotel about 3:45 p.m. He'd been at the hotel since 5 a.m. Officials asked what kind of turban his father wore. Burgundy, Gurinder and his family said. Then he was shown a picture of his father's face. In the picture, Jaswinder was no longer wearing the burgundy turban he'd carefully tied over his long white hair Thursday when he left home to pick up his first paycheck. The piece of clothing is a show of public commitment to the Sikh faith, emphasizing sovereignty and equality. ""We verified that's my dad,"" Gurinder said. ""That he's no more."" ► FedEx shooting memorial: Vigil held in Greenwood community for 8 victims ► 'Everybody fell in love with her': Family and friends gather to say goodbye to Karli Smith A now-familiar round of vigils, calls for action and finger pointing after the tragedy has begun. But above all, there's an empty space where eight people who were loved used to be: Matthew Alexander, 32, a former Butler University student who dispatched drivers to their locations and made sure they got doughnuts when coworkers brought them in. Samaria Blackwell, an athletic 19-year-old who worked as a lifeguard for IndyParks. Amarjeet Kaur Johal, a beloved 66-year-old grandmother who was pulling a double shift. Jasvinder Kaur, 50, another grandmother who recently immigrated to the United States. Amarjit Sekhon, a 48-year-old mother who became the primary breadwinner of her family after her husband became disabled. Karli Smith, another 19-year-old who graduated from Indianapolis Public Schools and loved softball and music. John Weisert, 74, a longtime engineer who volunteered with his wife at the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and was looking forward to spending more vacations with his wife. And Jaswinder Singh, 68, a deeply faithful man who had started his day excited to collect his first paycheck  in the United States.

134,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/AzlSZnskLNE/,"April 28, 2021 Remarks of President Joe Biden Address to a Joint Session of Congress As prepared for delivery Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and itâs about time. Biden was addressing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the first and only woman to hold that position â twice â and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman to hold that position. Both were sitting behind him, the first time two women have sat behind a President for a joint address to Congress. (Much less two women from California.) The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Of the nine Supreme Court justices, only Chief Justice John Roberts attended. Lots of Democrats would like to expand the size of the Supreme Court, although thatâs not something Biden mentioned Wednesday night. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet â and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different â a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Usually the chamber is packed. This year, just a fraction of the 535 representatives and senators attended due to Covid. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. Presidents did not come in person for an annual message to Congress throughout history. The practice was abandoned for most of the 19th century, until Woodrow Wilson brought it back. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis â and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation â and revitalizing our democracy. The crisis is Covid and the economic calamity it caused. The opportunity is using the recovery to remake the social fabric of the country by investing trillions of dollars in infrastructure and helping US families afford child care and college. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight â just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. The Civil War was the ultimate attack on US democracy. States began seceding from the Union before President Abraham Lincoln could even be sworn in. The 2021 rebellion was put down. Lawmakers were hiding from rioters in the House chamber in January, and three months later Biden delivered his address there as President. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. All new presidents â particularly those who have just taken over from the rival party â like to talk about how bad a situation they are inheriting. In Bidenâs case, heâs got a point, given the mass death from Covid and the economic uncertainty caused by Covid restrictions, plus the fact that former President Donald Trump tried to undermine the results of his election. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, thatâs what weâre doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, Americaâs house was on fire. This is weighty stuff. Biden will not mention his predecessor by name, but he is not shy about reminding his audience about the vast difference between how he governs and how Trump governed â or about creating a clear line between his presidency and good things happening. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer â and with the overwhelming support of the American people â Democrats, independents, and Republicans â we did act. Together - we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. Biden said Republicans and independents supported the relief bill, but in Congress, it was actually Democrats, along with two independents in the Senate, who passed the Covid relief bill. They had to bend Senate rules to get around a GOP filibuster to do it. This was Biden not spiking the football. Weâre already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots in 100 days â we will have provided over 220 million Covid shots in 100 days. Weâre marshalling every federal resource. Weâve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. You can quibble over whether the US was already on track to reach this Covid vaccine goal. It almost doesnât matter. The achievement of the vaccine program, started under Trump and fine-tuned under Biden, is miraculous and the US is ahead of its peers. Track vaccinations in your state here. Weâre setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone â is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against Covid-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. While the numbers on vaccinated seniors that Biden cites are largely true and his administration has made great strides in vaccinating Americans, he has benefited from timing. When he took office in January, vaccines had only just been made available and some seniors were only newly eligible. Senior deaths from Covid-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what itâs like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kidsâ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything to both of them. Casting vaccines as a way to get everyone back to normal is a key tactic Biden will employ to pressure people to get the shot. Thereâs still more work to do to beat this virus. We canât let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you â the American people â our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. Weâve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. Some have questioned whether the third round of checks was necessary, but Democrats pushed them since they were the fastest way to get relief money out to people in need. Itâs making a difference. For many people, itâs making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldnât work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor â something she put off for months because she didnât have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think youâd see that in America? The picture of hardship Biden painted here was somewhat at odds with the âAmerica is on the moveâ message earlier in the speech. Dealing with the effects of inequality in the US is going to be a key issue for him â but heâs also asking multimillionaires and billionaires not to look away from the reality faced by so many. Thatâs why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger â and hunger is down sharply already. Itâs true that hunger dropped during March, by at least one measure, though itâs more likely due to the rescue packageâs $1,400 stimulus checks than to its nutrition assistance measures. Weâre also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. The Supreme Court, now more conservative, still hasnât ruled on a Republican-led challenge that could upend the law. But at least in Congress, it seems like weâve finally reached the place where few people are talking about repealing the Affordable Care Act. Weâre making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. This effort â new cash payments through the tax code to many families â could indeed put a massive dent in child poverty. It was passed only on a one-year basis, however. Look for a fight over whether to continue it. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. Thatâs true, but the entire world economy is expected to grow, and one reason for that is the rebound from Covid and not simply the relief bill. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we canât stop now. Weâre in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Itâs notable that Biden has not reversed Trumpâs tariffs on China. Hereâs whatâs going on there. He also plugs his campaign slogan here â âBuild Back Better.â Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. The railroad system was created on Lincolnâs watch. The highways have Eisenhowerâs name on them. The GI bill transformed the country after World War II. Biden wants to be remembered for this kind of big thinking. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. Thatâs why I proposed The American Jobs Plan â a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. The âAmerican Jobs Planâ is Bidenâs infrastructure proposal. Hereâs whatâs in it. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. Itâs clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our childrenâs health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nationâs lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child â can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still donât have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. Harris just got a big new job, along with her task of dealing with the migration crisis. Read more about her growing role in the administration. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures â with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. Itâs easy not to think about the electrical grid until you donât have electricity. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldnât get the care they need for their family, their children. Biden is actually understating the number of women who left the labor force during the pandemic. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. Some people think âexistential crisis.â But itâs obvious that existential crisis has not convinced Republican senators or Americans worried about paying their bills that anything should be done on climate change. A jobs message could be more compelling. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. Thereâs no reason the blades for wind turbines canât be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers canât lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. This message has been emerging across the administration in recent weeks. For example, read this: Secretary of State Antony Blinken warns the US is falling behind in race to capitalize on climate opportunities. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs â jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: âBuy American.â American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Thatâs Bidenâs word of the night. He also takes a page from Trumpâs âBuy Americanâ effort. The way it should be. Now â I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy thatâs rapidly changing. These words are could be directly focused at Rust Belt and coal country Americans skeptical of a plan that is focused on addressing climate change rather than saving existing industries. These Americans, broadly, have switched from voting for Democrats to voting for Republicans over the past generation. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. Itâs true that some experts say the plan could create millions of jobs, but analysts differ on how much economic growth it could spur. These are good-paying jobs that canât be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associateâs degree. While itâs impossible to fact-check the impact of a plan that hasnât even passed Congress, a forecast from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce supports these figures, depending on how âcollege degreeâ is defined. The study estimates that 85% of the jobs from the infrastructure plan would be filled by those without bachelorâs degrees, while 75% would be filled by those without associateâs degrees, according to the estimate. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something Iâve always said. Wall Street didnât build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. Again and again, Biden appeals to blue-collar America, casting himself as the friend of the common person rather than of the elite. In that way, his arguments are not unlike Trumpâs populism, and itâs no accident. Thereâs going to be a midterm election sooner than you think. This passage also fits with the anti-Wall Street message of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the pro-union platform of the Democratic Party. And thatâs why Iâm calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act â the PRO Act â and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way â letâs also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. Democrats tried and failed to get the minimum wage hike into Bidenâs Covid relief bill. Theyâll keep trying. He this week ordered federal contractors to pay all their workers a minimum of $15 per hour. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Letâs get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. Itâs long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years â than we saw in the last 50 years. And weâre falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA â the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency â thatâs there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security â which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH â should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. One of Bidenâs frustrations with China is its degree of government involvement in research. The US government is already a driver of scientific research, and the President seems to want to turbocharge that. To develop breakthroughs â to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimerâs, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Letâs end cancer as we know it. Itâs within our power. This is a very personal issue for Biden, whose son Beau died of cancer. In fact, Biden was given the role of leading a task force to cure cancer â by then-President Barack Obama at the 2016 State of the Union address. Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones weâre talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their proposal. So, letâs get to work. We welcome ideas. Their proposal is much smaller and less ambitious than Bidenâs. (Read it here.) But he may yet need a few or maybe even all of their votes to get anything done. Itâs clear heâs trying not to alienate anyone in this speech. But, the rest of the world isnât waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We canât be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st century. This is a more nationalist speech than some might have expected. Heâs calling for Americans to unify in order to compete against China â hitting the same concerns Trump focused on in the early part of his presidency, but offering a totally different response from his predecessorâs strong-arming and grievances. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families â in our children. Thatâs why Iâm introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. American Rescue Plan, American Jobs Plan, American Families Plan â these are all massive proposals totaling almost $6 trillion and theyâd remake the country and the social fabric. Read here for what the families plan would offer. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st century. Thatâs why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America â starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to schoolânot day careâthey are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us â and sheâll be leading this effort. A fitting task for the first lady, who has dedicated her career to teaching in community colleges. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. This would be a transformational benefit for Americans who struggle to find child care so they can work. It would also be expensive. The most hard-pressed working families wonât have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one â a parent, spouse, or child. A temporary version of this was included in a Covid relief bill pushed by Democrats and signed into law by Trump in 2020. Biden wants to make it permanent. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 â and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, thatâs up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. While itâs impossible to fact check a projection, itâs true that at least two independent estimates found that the packageâs key measures are expected to reduce the share of children in poverty by more than half. But thereâs one big catch. The benefits are all temporary â a mix of one-time infusions and assistance that last no longer than a year. (Biden is seeking to extend or make permanent several of these key relief provisions as part of the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan that he proposed in his address on Wednesday.) Together, letâs extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. Biden is calling only for a four-year extension of the plan that will help bring American kids out of poverty, rather than a permanent new benefit. (2025 is also the year after the next presidential election.) Hereâs what to know about the temporary credit, which will put cash in parentsâ pockets. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Letâs make that provision permanent so their premiums donât go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address â this year â other critical priorities for Americaâs families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans â protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting womenâs health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Letâs lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and letâs lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America â nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Every president for a generation has tried to lower prescription drug costs. Letâs do what weâve always talked about. Letâs give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. Just how much allowing Medicare to negotiate would actually lower drug prices has long been contested. It would depend on how the program is set up. That wonât just help people on Medicare â it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act â expand Medicare coverage and benefits â without costing taxpayers one additional penny. Weâve talked about it long enough â Democrats and Republicans. Letâs get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? Everyone likes to give things to voters. No one likes to raise taxes. The key to Bidenâs plan is that he wants to make the wealthy pay. (Side note: The relief bill reduced the average tax bill for Americans making less than $75,000 to zero this year. Read about it here.) Iâve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Letâs start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. Itâs time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. Even some corporations have bought into raising the corporate tax rate, just a few years after Trump and a then-Republican majority in Congress slashed it. Here are the broad outlines of Bidenâs plan. A recent study shows that 55 of the nationâs biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. Thatâs not right. Weâre going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share â and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, weâre going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans â those making $400,000 or more â back up to 39.6%. Thatâs where it was when George W. Bush became president. This is smart politics from Biden. Raising taxes is not popular. Raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy is going to be more popular than across the board, and restoring taxes to where they were under the last fiscal conservative Republican president might sound bearable to Republicans. Weâre going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. Thatâs estimated to be billions of dollars. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren didnât wind up in Bidenâs administration but her messaging did. Look, Iâm not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. Theyâre already paying enough. What Iâve proposed is fair. Itâs fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans Iâve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they donât want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America â ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development â it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic â working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. Itâs time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. You hear that, Reagan Republicans? Trickle-down economics â the idea that letting the wealthy and corporations have low taxes and few regulations will unleash so much growth that everyone will benefit â may be on the ropes as inequality grows. A broad consensus of economists â left, right, center â agree that what Iâm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. Iâve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example â not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders â many Iâve known for a long time â the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back â but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we arenât going it alone â weâre going to be leading with our allies. Putting the US back on the world stage as a leader and member of international agreements is a major departure from the Trump years. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone â from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change â and as weâre experiencing now, pandemics. Thereâs no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs â and we are meeting them â we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries â just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. There has been an intense internal debate over vaccine sharing in the Biden administration. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. Itâs a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. Thatâs why â I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world â from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. Read more here about that climate summit, conducted largely via livestream. Biden said the US will aim to reduce carbon emissions by 52% by 2030. The key will be follow-through and accountability for the other countries that took part. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet â and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments Iâve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition â and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe â not to start conflict â but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what Iâve said to many world leaders â that America wonât back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. Standing up to China, militarily and philosophically; competing with China, economically and strategically; and uniting Americans against China is a main theme of this speech. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea â unique in the world. We are all created equal. Itâs who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we donât seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russiaâs interference in our elections and cyber - attacks on our government and businesses â and they did both of those things and I did respond. Biden imposed sweeping new sanctions on Russia and expelled 10 diplomats. But we can also cooperate when itâs in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms â and as weâre working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Koreaâs nuclear programs that present a serious threat to Americaâs security and world security â we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And Iâm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, itâs time to bring our troops home. There arenât many US troops left in Afghanistan, but Bidenâs decision to bring them home by September 11, 2021, was made over objections in the Pentagon and to criticism from some Democrats and many Republicans. (Though Trump did the hard part by setting a May deadline for bringing troops home.) Even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake â the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we wonât ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined â the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. Saying that Islamist terrorism is less of a threat than White supremacist terrorism isnât news, but itâs a shift in the way Americans have thought about terror. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her fatherâs funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floydâs young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye-to-eye, she said to me, âDaddy changed the world.â After the conviction of George Floydâs murderer, we can see how right she was â if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. This section is about police reform, but what Biden calls for here â healing the soul of the country â is larger than that. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floydâs name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Race and compromise over a national policing standard was a major portion of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scottâs Republican rebuttal. He complained that Democrats are unwilling to work in good faith on compromise. Democrats have complained that Republicans are uninterested in meaningful reform. One sticking point is âqualified immunityâ - whether police officers can be held individually liable for their actions. Letâs get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floydâs death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Battling child poverty with the child tax credit and ensuring college are also viewed by Biden and many other Democrats as vehicles for addressing racial injustice. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans â Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94-1 to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes weâve seen this past year â and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home â especially the young people who are so brave â I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Letâs reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so-called âboyfriendâ loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. Itâs estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner â every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half-staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. Biden has made clear he thinks the House and the Senate should work on his infrastructure package before they tackle gun control proposals. Neither proposal currently has support from Senate Republicans. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000âs, that law expired and weâve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know â the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence â I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so-called âghost guns.â They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they canât be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits arenât required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But itâs time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines again. Donât tell me it canât be done. Weâve done it before â¦ and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters â theyâll tell you thereâs no possible justification for having 100 rounds â 100 bullets â in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldnât be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people â including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldnât be a Red vs. Blue issue. Itâs an American issue. Biden has not mentioned the filibuster in this speech, but nearly everything he has suggested in this address could be killed by a minority of Republican senators. It will take 10 Republicans to pass any big or controversial bills. Republicans have so far been united against him. Hereâs more on that. And hereâs what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Letâs end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. Itâs time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border â pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship â pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem â I have sent you a bill, now pass it. Biden is facing an acute crisis on the border right now, which heâs going to have to deal with whether or not he gets legislation. See these charts. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. Biden didnât specify the program, but itâs true that the Obama administration set up a program to provide safer pathways to the United States that was later terminated by Trump. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. Iâm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress wonât pass my plan â letâs at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers â the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man-made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic â as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America â we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history â in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead itâs being attacked. Republicans in key states like Georgia, Florida and Arizona are passing bills to do things like limit mail-in voting, curb some early voting and make the process more cumbersome in response to Trumpâs false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020. They argue it will make things more secure. Democrats argue these state laws are roadblocks intended to drive down turnout. Read more here. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitolâdesecrating our democracyâremain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisisâa test of whether our democracy could survive. Again, Biden only obliquely mentioned Trump here. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us â created equal in the image of God â have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? Americaâs adversaries â the autocrats of the world â are betting it canât. Biden positioned the US as the leader of the free world vs. a rising tide of autocrats. He seems to be talking about Russia here, but he could also be talking about China. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works â and can deliver for the people. These two ideas are the lodestars of Bidenâs presidency. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the peopleâs faith in our democracy to deliver. Weâre vaccinating the nation. Weâre creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Weâre delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. Thatâs the essence of America. Thatâs democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, âWe the Peopleâ. Itâs time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. Itâs us. Itâs âWe the people.â In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded usâIn America: we do our part. Thatâs all Iâm asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy â of pandemic and pain â and âWe the Peopleâ did not flinch. This is quite a sentence. It lumps Trump and Covid together and congratulates the country for getting through it all. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. Itâs never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isnât. We are the United States of America. There is nothing â nothing â beyond our capacity â nothing we canât do â if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. This is a unique ending. Usually the last line is some version of âMay God Bless the United States of America.â",2021-04-29 09:25:12.752110,"From the President's appeal to blue-collar America to his unique ending, here's the context and the facts",,1095,http://www.cnn.com/

136,https://www.boston.com/travel/travel/2021/04/29/las-vegas-is-seeing-a-surge-of-visitors-again-its-like-somebody-turned-on-a-light-switch,"By Natalie B. Compton, Washington Post  After a year of battling the coronavirus on the front lines, health-care workers Charmaine Lamsin and Dennis Bowman were overdue for a vacation when they spotted a cheap flight to Las Vegas in March. For just $33 per person, the husband and wife could fly from their Seattle home to the entertainment capital of the world, where hotel prices were as unbelievable as the airfare. They booked a reservation at ARIA Resort & Casino, a luxury property, for $85 a night. “It was their premier suite. . . . It was facing the Strip, and we had a great view,” Lamsin says. “It was like the best Vegas vacation I’ve had actually.” Lamsin and Bowman are not the only people returning to the city after a hiatus from travel. According to hotel and flight booking data from Priceline, Las Vegas has been one of 2021′s most popular domestic travel destinations. The number of visitors has been climbing consistently for months, along with the Strip’s gambling revenue. The influx of business comes at a critical time for the hospitality-reliant city. With a quarter of the state’s jobs in the tourism industry, Nevada faced the highest unemployment in the country (and U.S. history) during the height of the pandemic. UNITE HERE Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers, pushed for health and safety protocols in May for casino employees. That fight led to getting legislation passed by Gov. Steve Sisolak, D, on Aug. 11, says Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman for the union. Named after a Caesars Palace employee who became infected with the coronavirus after returning to work in June and died later that month, the “Adolfo Fernandez Bill” required hotels and casinos to implement new pandemic procedures. Khan says passing the bill was a win for those who work in Vegas and those who visit it. “When you protect workers, you protect tourists,” Khan says. The pools and decks were crowded at Stadium Swim at the Circa on Friday, March 19, 2021. During their recent trip, Lamsin and Bowman experienced the new law in action. They said Vegas had never felt cleaner. Room service – available at limited hours instead of 24/7 – was delivered in a box to their hotel room door. At the poker table, players sat between plastic partitions instead of elbow to elbow. “We’ve even put chip cleaning in the tables,” says Joe Yalda, vice president of guest experience at Red Rock Casino, Resort & Spa, a luxury property off Strip in the Vegas suburbs near Red Rock Canyon. Gamblers can now skip cash handling at the table and purchase chips directly with a credit or debit card. But that isn’t to say there haven’t been crowds. In March, Nevada casinos took in $1 billion in winnings for the first time since February 2020. During spring break and the NCAA tournament, one of Vegas’s busiest times, pools and streets were more packed than they had been in months. Casino capacity went from 35 percent to 50 percent in mid-March. On May 1, Nevada will remove social distancing mandates and reopen nightclubs and buffets. “Now that the virus has been reduced and there’s vaccine solutions in place and everyone has availability to it by May, that means that you’re starting to see the floodgates open up,” says Lori Nelson-Kraft, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. “That pent-up demand, you can just really feel it.” Nelson-Kraft says Vegas began to look more like its former self with each passing month of 2021, particularly when March Madness and spring break crowds poured into town and as live entertainment returns. NASCAR is back. Cirque du Soleil announced it will perform again beginning in June. The city’s first big conference, the World of Concrete, is scheduled at the Las Vegas Convention Center in June. In time for that milestone, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $52.5 million underground transportation system with all-electric vehicles beneath the convention center is expected to debut. The first passenger station of that tunnel is about two miles away at the $4.3 billion project Resorts World, opening its doors on June 24. It will be the first built-from-the-ground-up resort on the Strip to open in more than a decade. When it opens, it will have 3,500 rooms to fill. Opening a behemoth project like Resorts World – which required more than 3,000 construction workers to build – would have come with plenty of hurdles in normal times; the pandemic wasn’t one the team saw coming. Scott Sibella, president of Resorts World Las Vegas, says it has been a tough year, but he is optimistic about how the city is recovering with the current leisure travel boom. Until domestic and international business travel returns, however, the hospitality industry will continue to struggle with low weekday visitor numbers. “You can’t survive on [leisure traveler] forever. We know that this city’s all about conventions and the other segments,” Sibella says. The city is banking on the third and fourth quarters of 2021 when more conventions and concerts should bring visitors back in droves. In the meantime, local businesses are already feeling relief after the nightmare of 2020. Restaurateur Elizabeth Blau of Honey Salt has lived in Vegas for 23 years, through 9/11, the financial crises, the 2017 mass shooting and now the pandemic. “We’ve definitely had our share of extraordinarily devastating events in this city, and the pandemic was something like no other,” Blau says. Blau did everything she could think of to keep Honey Salt afloat, from taking personal protective equipment (PPE) loans, launching new takeout offerings and turning the restaurant into a marketplace selling cocktail kits and hard-to-get-items such as toilet paper. She also joined the Delivering With Dignity initiative, which provided 375,000 meals to vulnerable individuals and families in the Las Vegas Valley. The endeavor helped save 57 restaurant jobs while many, many more were lost. “I will not lie; it was a very, very difficult time,” Blau says. “Trying to contend with your own problems while watching what was going on in our community was just heartbreaking.” Now, Blau is preparing for record numbers this summer. Ryan Doherty, founder of the bar and restaurant group Corner Bar Management, says his businesses are starting to do better than they did in 2019. Most of Corner Bar’s customers are locals, so even though most tourists may stay on the Strip, their return has been a positive impact for his off-Strip spots. “Vegas is full of hospitality workers, so when it’s busy, everyone here is making money and they’re going out and spending money,” Doherty says. Makers & Finders, a Latin-inspired coffee shop and bar is seeing both local and tourist business skyrocket even though its locations in downtown Las Vegas and the city’s arts district are off the typical tourist track “About four to six weeks ago, there was definitely a clear kind of shift in the energy,” says Josh Molina, founder of Makers & Finders. “It’s like somebody turned on a light switch.” Molina has been watching tourism expand beyond the Strip for years, but he thinks the pandemic is accelerating the evolution. He believes that as Vegas reopened, more visitors gravitated to new neighborhoods and experiences while properties on the Strip remained closed. Tourists “discovered” small bars and restaurants, hiking at Red Rock Canyon and Mount Charleston, he says. And they’re appreciating what they have found. “They were forced to go beyond the Strip,” Molina says. “I think we’re going to see the impact of that in the next coming years since that awareness happened.” Enable breaking news notifications straight to your internet browser.

April 29, 2021 Jeff Kelman grew up in a progressive Massachusetts home, the son of two mothers. He had no idea people could even own guns until he was in middle school. But after college, he started shooting for sport – and developed a sharp eye. As a Jewish man whose wife is Chinese American, he is keenly aware of racial discrimination, and the potential for that to turn into violence. So, he carries a gun for self-defense. Forward movement on gun safety at the federal level seems unlikely, even amid a wave of mass violence. Yet as gun owners become more diverse, especially in the suburbs, there’s growing room for compromise. Forward movement on gun safety at the federal level seems unlikely, even amid a wave of mass violence. Yet as gun owners become more diverse, especially in the suburbs, there’s growing room for compromise. Like other suburban gun owners, he is open to at least some regulation, particularly focused on gun safety. In 2020, the United States saw the largest number of gun-related deaths – 19,000 – in almost two decades. This spring has also seen a resurgence of mass shootings (defined as four or more people killed), which had paused during pandemic lockdowns. In response, the Democratic-led House passed legislation that would require background checks for all gun buyers and extend the time the FBI has to conduct those checks. A majority of gun owners support both ideas. The bill’s future in a 50-50 Senate is uncertain at best. Whether the engagement of suburban gun owners like Mr. Kelman is enough to break gridlock in Washington is far from certain. Guns, after all, are deeply embedded in America’s polarized identity politics. George Cook had never thought much about guns until about four years ago. Then he grew older and got married, and felt like he had a lot more to protect. So he bought a handgun. And last year, at the height of social justice protests and scattered violence, he bought an AR-15. During the pandemic, first-time gun owners spurred record levels of gun sales for what looks like the second year in a row, with uncertainty, political polarization, and a spike in shootings around the country cited as reasons for the buying spree. Today, Mr. Cook goes a few times a year to the range to shoot his firearms. Aside from that, neither weapon ever leaves his house. He figures about half the houses on his street on the Richmond, Virginia, outskirts have guns in them. He cites suburban values as one reason he bought a gun. Forward movement on gun safety at the federal level seems unlikely, even amid a wave of mass violence. Yet as gun owners become more diverse, especially in the suburbs, there’s growing room for compromise. Forward movement on gun safety at the federal level seems unlikely, even amid a wave of mass violence. Yet as gun owners become more diverse, especially in the suburbs, there’s growing room for compromise. “It’s easy to measure how bad guns can be for sure,” says Mr. Cook, who works as a corporate treasury analyst. “You can look at all the deaths, the mass shootings. But it’s not easy to measure the bad that they prevented.” Those values are notable in another way: Like other suburban gun owners, Mr. Cook says he is open to at least some regulation, particularly those focused on gun safety. Interviews with suburban gun owners underscore how U.S. gun culture is becoming more diverse, more nuanced, and increasingly focused on the personal responsibility of individuals who choose to own a gun. In 2020, the U.S. saw the largest number of gun-related deaths – 19,000 – in almost two decades. This spring has also seen a resurgence of mass shootings (defined as four or more people killed), which had paused during pandemic lockdowns: The March 16 mass shooting in Atlanta, where eight people were killed, was followed quickly by three more, including in a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket and an Indianapolis FedEx facility. On March 11, the Democratic-led House passed legislation that would require background checks for all gun buyers and extend the time that the FBI has to conduct those checks. A majority of gun owners support both ideas. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has vowed to bring a package to the Senate as early as May, but Republican support is considered unlikely. Whether the engagement of suburban gun owners like Mr. Cook in the debate over gun safety is enough to break gridlock in Washington is far from certain. Guns, after all, are deeply embedded in America’s polarized identity politics. But the emerging focus on gun safety “is really an important effort,” says Adam Winkler, author of “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.” “We can talk about gun control and gun regulation until we’re blue in the face, but there’s always going to be a lot of guns in America. They are here to stay. ... [But] many of our gun problems can be lessened or reduced by responsible gun ownership.” The image of a typical gun owner is a white man, usually conservative, who lives in the country. Yet most American adults have shot a gun at least once: 72%, Pew found in 2017. And nearly half of all non-gun owners said they would consider owning a gun in the future. Increasingly gun owners are represented by more suburban groups like the Pink Pistols, Liberal Gun Owners, and blogs like Gun Culture 2.0, run by a gun-toting college professor in North Carolina. Polls have found that a majority of gun owners favor stronger gun regulations, as long as the basic right of gun ownership is respected. Part of the reason is that suburban Americans who used to never think about gun violence are now thinking about it “too much,” as one suburban woman told the Cook Political Report in a wide-ranging focus group last year. Yet for many of those worried about violence, the answer isn’t necessarily fewer guns. Dan Gross has long understood that paradox. His brother was shot in the head and permanently disabled in a mass shooting at the Empire State Building in 1997. The former head of the Brady Campaign has worked for years to enact stronger gun laws, but always, he says, with a sense of empathy for law-abiding gun owners. He says his support for gun ownership hasn’t changed – he’s just become more outspoken on how to actually reduce gun violence. He has criticized President Joe Biden for calling for an assault weapons ban, given that it only riles up Second Amendment supporters and, more importantly, fails to acknowledge that assault rifles are rarely used in homicides. Just 1% of gun-related deaths are “active shooter” situations, compared with 30% that are homicides. Instead of trying to ban certain guns from all people, he says the focus should be on how to keep all guns away from certain people, such as stronger red flag and background check laws. Meaningful change, says Mr. Gross, means changing the entire conversation from one defined by politics to one defined by common values and goals, specifically, protecting the community. Speaking in front of a potentially unfriendly Second Amendment rally in Washington, D.C., in 2019, he saw evidence that it could work. “I start to get momentum and people are applauding ...,” says Mr. Gross. “And there’s a guy toward the front, and he was the one guy that, [stereotypically] if I should be scared of someone, it’s that person. And when I said, ‘Now, we may not agree on everything,’ that’s the guy who screams out: ‘That’s OK!’” A focus on respect and responsibility rings true to Jeff Kelman of New Hampshire. Mr. Kelman grew up in a progressive Massachusetts home, the son of two mothers. He had no idea people could even own guns until he was in middle school. But after college, he started shooting for sport – and developed a sharp eye. As a Jewish man whose wife is Chinese American, he is keenly aware of racial discrimination in the U.S., and the potential for that to turn into violence. So, he carries a gun for self-defense. Instead of lining up his views ideologically, Mr. Kelman prefers to approach the issue as a cost-benefit analysis. Gun control laws have the potential to save lives, but also come at the cost of personal freedom. In that analysis, everyone has a different threshold. “If you’re going to have an armed society, you almost need to have a ubiquitously armed society,” he says. “Alternatively, if you have a society that isn’t going to take up this act and they’re going to delegate that to the police and the military ... then again, both of those societies will be, I think broadly, fairly safe.” The more it becomes a “patchwork,” he says, the less it makes sense. Some sense that suburban gun owners present a unique opportunity for pragmatic change. Nestled between rural areas where lots of people hunt and cities where most gun violence occurs, the suburbs offer a sense that “the old patterns or the old methods aren’t working very well,” and a growing frustration that “we’re not getting anywhere in the gun violence prevention debate right now,” says Professor Winkler at the University of California, Los Angeles. But others think their overall influence would be marginal, at best. “It’s not clear, as a separate political force, how much impact [suburban gun owners] would have outside of a ticking up in public opinion polls support for stronger gun laws,” says Robert Spitzer, author of “The Politics of Gun Control.” Anecdotally at least, Tom O’Connor, who sits on the board of Gun Owners for Responsible Ownership, finds gun owners in those expanding areas more pragmatic than traditional gun owners. That expresses itself, he says, in their support for universal background checks, red flag laws, and requirements for safe storage. Rights, after all, change over time, says Mr. O’Connor. And if the public doesn’t support absolute access to firearms, that access could be curtailed. “It’s clearly something we have to deal with,” he says. Mr. Cook, the Richmond suburbanite, says values, culture, and identity complicate the search for compromise. After all, he says, people use guns in so many different ways across the U.S., whether for hunting, sharp-shooting, or protection. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Yet he has felt his own attitudes shift. “The more things [like mass shootings] happen, the more my views change,” he says. “I’m not set in stone in my ways. I still think guns should be legal, and yet I’m definitely deeply affected by this. It makes me second-guess myself.” Editor's note: A clarification has been made indicating that Jeff Kelman began shooting for sport after college. The timing of the House passage of legislation relating to background checks has also been clarified. Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize.

Ron Kind, D-Wis., invoked last month's tragic mass shooting targeting multiple Atlanta spas while defending his business deal with a massage spa that advertised on websites where people advertise illicit sexual arrangements. Kind rents a storefront property to Asian Sunny Massage – formerly known as Impression Spa – that had advertisements for their business on websites such as AssortList and RubMaps, a Fox News report revealed Wednesday. WISCONSIN DEM’S PROPERTY USED FOR SEEDY MASSAGE PARLOR THAT TOUTED 'YOUNG' MASSEUSE Kind accused his Republican challenger, former Navy SEAL Derrick Van Orden, of pushing ""a baseless smear rooted in racism and insinuations."" ""As a former special prosecutor, I take any allegation of wrongdoing seriously. But that’s not what this is. This is a baseless smear rooted in racism and insinuations. Tawni and I have never received any complaint from the community or police about this small business,"" Kind said in a statement released to the La Crosse Tribune. ""Because of Derrick Van Orden and his allies pushing lies, local police are increasing patrols to ensure the safety of this Asian-owned small business. In light of what has happened across the country and especially in Atlanta last month, it is irresponsible, dangerous and despicable of Derrick Van Orden to slander this local business owner and put law enforcement in harm’s way,"" the congressman added. Asian Sunny Massage in La Crosse, Wisconsin, deleted their Facebook page following reports this week that revealed advertisements from the business on sites like RubMaps, which USA Today has described as a ""Yelp for sex spas."" The massage parlor's owner, Jie Yang, told Fox News that the business only performs massages and does not provide other ""services."" The spa's attorneys gave a statement to the La Crosse Tribune on Wednesday, as well, defending the business. ""These stories are a sad attempt to use politics in its worst way and, in doing so, to hurt an Asian American operated business in the process,"" they said. ""Asian Sunny Massage runs a perfectly legitimate business. It operates in accordance with all state and local regulations."" TWITTER BLOCKS TIM SCOTT 'UNCLE TIM' TOPIC THAT TRENDED FOR HOURS AFTER BIDEN REBUTTAL ""Any statements or implications to the contrary are defamatory and anyone in the press or politics saying otherwise is risking serious legal action,"" the statement continued. ""In today's political climate in which Asians and Asian-run businesses have been the subject of bullying, harassment and mass shootings, targeting an Asian business with these fake assertions in a weak attempt to make some political point is really despicable,"" they added. NRCC spokesperson Mike Berg told Fox News on Thursday that the congressman ""has a lot of questions to answer."" ATLANTA SHOOTING SUSPECT TELLS POLICE ATTACKS NOT RACIALLY MOTIVATED, WAS PURPORTEDLY DRIVEN BY SEX ADDICTION ""If Kind profited from any illegal activity, voters will hold him accountable,"" Berg added. Van Orden said on Wednesday that the Fox News report regarding Asian Sunny Massage was ""incredibly disgusting"" and called for an investigation into the business. ""Today's report is incredibly disturbing and opens the door to many more questions that need to be answered,"" said Van Orden. ""I fully support law enforcement and encourage them to investigate this business to uncover any potential illegal activity."" La Crosse Police Department Officer Dustin Darling told WIZM on Wednesday that there is ""no active investigation"" into Asian Sunny Massage and that there was ""nothing that's been substantiated or [found] on any of the stuff here."" ""We did a 10-year listing of calls for service and there’s very, very minimal calls there at all. No reports were even completed for anything there,"" said Darling. ""When I looked at the 10-year one [public records request], there’s nothing on it."" Kind has rented the property to Asian Sunny Massage since 2018 and made between $15,001 and $50,000 in passive income from the property between 2018 and 2019. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Impression Spa first opened in April 2018 and an ad appeared on BodyRubsMap on its opening day. BodyRubsMap has advertised itself as the ""best alternative to Backpage,"" a now-seized website known as ""the largest online U.S. marketplace for sex trafficking."" In multiple Facebook posts in 2019, Impression Spa included screenshots of advertisements on AssortList that featured suggestive photos of women and the business’ phone number.

For resources on sexual harassment and assault go to https://www.rainn.org/ in the U.S. and http://ecwronline.org/ in Egypt. More: A woman in Egypt is using an Instagram account to unmask a man accused by dozens of women of sexual harassment and assault. Video of an alleged gang rape in Egypt was so widely shared that it had a name: “The Fairmont Incident.” So why hasn’t anyone been charged with a violent crime? Egypt jailed two TikTok influencers accused of violating “family values.” Activists say it’s part of a broader government crackdown targeting women.

140,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/04/29/gun-legislation-boulder-shooting-king-soopers-colorado/,"Trending: Colorado lawmakers debuted a package of three more gun bills Thursday, saying more needed to be done after last month’s mass shooting at a Boulder King Soopers. These bills join three others that Democrats brought forward this year. Gov. Jared Polis has already signed two — HB21-1106 requiring the safe storage of firearms in homes and SB21-078 to mandate reporting of lost or stolen guns. Another that would prevent some domestic abusers from keeping their guns is making its way through the legislature. For weeks, Democrats had said they were planning to introduce more gun legislation, and much of what was presented Thursday was expected: SB21-256 to allow local governments to pass guns laws that go beyond the state’s, HB21-1298 to strengthen the background-check process and HB21-1299 to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention (which would also be tasked with education about the state’s “red-flag” law). “It’s been just over a month since 10 lives were stolen from my community,” Senate Majority Leader Steve Fenberg said. “These lives were stolen while at a King Soopers, where my family and I do our shopping. These lives were stolen while they were working in their jobs, maybe helping a customer bag their groceries. Others may have been grabbing that last item to make a family dinner for that evening.” Republicans opposed all three previous bills. Both Senate GOP spokesman Sage Naumann and House Minority Leader Hugh McKean said their caucuses haven’t seen the text of the new bills, but they believe the focus should be on mental health. “We will review any legislation with an open mind, but we, on principle do not believe punishing law-abiding Coloradans is the way to solve this problem,” Naumann said. McKean, a Loveland Republican, said many of the ideas introduced are ineffective and unenforceable, and don’t address what he sees as the root cause of the problem: mental health problems. GOP Rep. Dan Woog of Erie added that those who want to commit a crime will find a way to get a gun regardless of such laws. Democrats, however, say they are backing multiple pieces of legislation related to mental health, even if they’re not all directly tied to guns. If created as proposed, the Office of Gun Violence Prevention will also include programming on crisis management. And experts have warned that the discussion about mental health after mass shootings often doesn’t provide the full story. Notably, Democrats did not include a statewide assault weapons ban in their proposals, nor setting up mandatory waiting periods, despite discussing it since the beginning of session. The local control bill is being sponsored by Fenberg and Rep. Edie Hooton, both Boulder Democrats. Just before the King Soopers shooting, a Boulder County District Court judge blocked the city from enforcing its 2018 ban on “assault-style weapons” and magazines with a capacity to accept 10 or more rounds, citing a 2003 state law that preempts local gun restrictions. Sponsors of the background check measure want to institute a five-year gun-purchase ban after someone is convicted of certain violent misdemeanors, which Boulder Democratic Rep. Judy Amabile said could have stopped the man charged in the Boulder shooting from buying the gun that was used. Lawmakers also said they believe it will close the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which had allowed the man who killed nine people at a South Carolina church in 2015 to purchase his gun. The Office of Gun Violence Prevention will be tasked with collecting data and setting up strategies and programs to prevent gun violence, including street outreach programs. Sen. Rhonda Fields of Aurora, one of the bill’s sponsors, said the office will also be working with communities of color. Updated 3:08 p.m. May 3, 2021: An earlier version of this story included a quote from Sen. Rhonda Fields that incorrectly stated the number of firearm deaths every year in Colorado. In 2019, 846 Coloradans died by firearms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

April 29, 2021 After the recent mass shootings in Atlanta, in which six women of Asian descent were killed, communities of color are mobilizing together to battle racism. “The fact that so many Blacks and Hispanics marched in solidarity with Asian groups … is a positive indication that minorities see injustice against one group as injustice against all,” says Earl Ofari Hutchinson, author of “Why Black Lives Do Matter.” Yet he wonders whether that cross-activism will go beyond policing and anti-racism. “Will that unity translate into unity … on such issues as voter suppression, housing, jobs and education, and health disparities?” he asks. The fight for justice is not a zero-sum game. Solidarity across racial groups in protests against anti-Asian hate demonstrates that. The fight for justice is not a zero-sum game. Solidarity across racial groups in protests against anti-Asian hate demonstrates that. Some young activists believe it will. Emma Tang, a Taiwanese American student at New York University, calls this moment the “birth of a fresh, new, powerful coalition.” Since being attacked in what her friends call a hate crime, she appreciates the support of other racial groups more than ever. At a recent protest, she witnessed a diverse crowd fighting for Asian women. “It … makes me feel safe knowing that there are people looking out for us,” she says. “Stop Asian Hate would not be around today without Black Lives Matter,” she adds. “We need one another to advance our liberation.” Emma Tang, a Taiwanese American student at New York University, was sitting outside a Chinese restaurant last October, eating with her friends, when a white man approached her from behind and hit her over the head with a dirty bed sheet. Shocked – and despite her friends saying they thought she was a victim of a hate crime – Ms. Tang never reported the incident to police. Instead, she took to Instagram, and her 84,000 followers. But her posts didn’t go over well online. Black activists took issue with Ms. Tang for perpetuating stereotypes that Black people are dangerous and that Asian people need help. “I was trying to have a conversation about how Black people can stand in solidarity with Asian people more, and it came off badly,” says Ms. Tang. “Black activists started calling me out and they started having conversations with me.” The fight for justice is not a zero-sum game. Solidarity across racial groups in protests against anti-Asian hate demonstrates that. The fight for justice is not a zero-sum game. Solidarity across racial groups in protests against anti-Asian hate demonstrates that. One of them was Kiara Williams, from Queens. “She was trying to address what the Asian community was going through and rightfully so,” Ms. Williams says, “but she was kind of villainizing the Black community.” After the two spoke online, Ms. Williams invited Ms. Tang over for lunch, where the women bonded over their shared pain. “Both of our communities are there for each other. There is no, ‘You hurt me more. No, you hurt me more,’” says Ms. Williams. The two are now friends and work together as “comrades” to advance Black and Asian solidarity. “I think we’ve both changed each other’s perceptions of our communities,” says Ms. Tang. In the wake of the recent mass shootings in Atlanta, in which eight people were killed, including six women of Asian descent, communities of color are mobilizing together because of their shared struggles and common goal of battling racism. “The fact that so many Blacks and Hispanics marched in solidarity with Asian groups … is a positive indication that minorities see injustice against one group as injustice against all,” says Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a radio show host, political analyst, and author of “Why Black Lives Do Matter.” “This could be a huge political game changer in the future,” he adds. Gabriel “Jack” Chin, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, also calls this moment a turning point. “There’s more discussion, there’s more anxiety, there’s more fear, there’s more identification of a particular problem than I’ve ever seen before. And the only thing I can analogize it to historically is the civil rights movement of the ’60s.” Martin Luther King Jr. used the media to advance his civil rights cause, but the news coverage often failed to capture the racial unity at his demonstrations. “There were white people there. There were Latino people there. But it wasn’t necessarily covered that way,” says Clara Rodriguez, professor of sociology at Fordham University’s College at Lincoln Center. “It’s both history and this tendency to view groups separate from one another, and I think it contributes to people thinking in terms of ‘Well it’s that group, and I have nothing to do with that group.’” For Ms. Tang, the fight is intersectional, but she acknowledges that there is anti-Black racism in the Asian American community, which can lead to distrust between the two groups. In fact, however, the notion that there are high levels of Black-on-Asian crime is false. Researchers at the University of Michigan found that, in 2020, 90% of perpetrators in reported anti-Asian incidents were white, and only 5% of perpetrators were Black. While some may try to weaponize Black-Asian conflict, hate-inspired tragedies like the 2019 mass shooting targeting Mexicans at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; police killings of Blacks and Latinos; and the Atlanta shootings are actually fueling unity. “What you have seen as a result of these highly visible and highly tragic events is the intensifying of a reckoning with how racism and discrimination have infected many of our systems and people at the same time,” says Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, deputy vice president for policy and advocacy at UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy group. “And they need to stand up and not only call it out, but do the work to address the disparate treatment and fight for equity.” John Minchillo/AP



Demonstrators gather outside the Hennepin County Government Center before the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin in the killing of George Floyd advances to jury deliberations on April 19, 2021, in Minneapolis. Protests over Mr. Floyd's murder and the spike in anti-Asian hate have drawn supporters across racial groups. Some people of color, like Ms. Tang and Ms. Williams, are fighting for the collective – “to do right by all communities of color,” as Ms. Williams puts it. They are uniting to dismantle stereotypes like the “model minority” myth, which pits minority groups against each other. Asian Americans, for example, are often praised for being well educated and successful. And while it is true that they have the highest median income across racial groups, including white Americans, the income gap among Asian Americans is the largest within any racial or ethnic group in the country, with almost 10% of the community living below the poverty line. Rather than presenting an accurate picture of the diversity among Asian Americans, the “model minority” stereotype is held up to other groups as a sign of their failure. What’s needed, says Dr. Rodriguez from Fordham, is to “get people to think in terms beyond race … to think in terms of what are the things that we have in common and how can we all benefit?” Ms. Williams benefited from that unity when she attended her first protest after George Floyd’s murder. She was overwhelmed, she says, to see the multiracial makeup of the Black Lives Matter marches last summer. “For a long time, I thought Black people were alone.” In fact, nonwhites across races share concerns on a variety of issues, including immigration reform and U.S. policy at the Mexico border. “I think Asians can understand some aspects of the Latinx situation as fellow immigrants. And, of course, there’s a lot of undocumented Asian people in the United States,” says Professor Chin from UC Davis. “Asian-Americans have an experience of being hassled by the police in the same way as Latinx people at the border.” Cross-activism on matters like policing and anti-racism is unprecedented right now, but according to Mr. Hutchinson, the radio show host, it’s still not enough to create true solidarity. “Will that unity translate into unity in a fight together on such issues as voter suppression, housing, jobs and education, and health disparities?” he asks. Mr. Chin wonders as well, noting that, despite the current unity, there is not “a utopian agreement among all these racial groups.” Yet some young activists believe this moment is the beginning of their revolution. Ms. Tang calls it “the birth of a fresh, new, powerful coalition of BIPOC communities aligning together in the grassroots sphere” (referring to Black, Indigenous, and other people of color). To continue developing strong, sustainable coalitions, Mr. Hutchinson says, protesters need “planning, proper issues-framing, consistency, and most importantly, aware, politically engaged, proactive leadership.” Ms. Williams, for one, says she is dedicated to supporting other communities of color because she sees their struggles against oppression intertwined with hers. “It’s about being mentally strong, never backing down,” she explains.

At a recent solidarity march, she witnessed a diverse crowd of Black transgender women, Indigenous people, and Latinos fighting for women of Asian descent. “It feels very validating, and it makes me feel safe knowing that there are people looking out for us. And we don’t have to fight this on our own,” she says. Ms. Tang, who hides a taser up her sleeve whenever she leaves her apartment, says she’s less fearful now whenever someone yells a racial slur or harasses her in the streets. “Stop Asian Hate would not be around today without Black Lives Matter,” she says. “Our movements have always bounced off of each other and been inspired by each other.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.

As President Joe Biden spoke about mass shootings and gun control during an address to Congress on Wednesday night, C-SPAN cameras cut to Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert shaking her head, looking down at her phone and tweeting, “Shall not be infringed.” Biden’s speech — which briefly mentioned the Boulder shooting — gave Colorado Democrats much to clap for, as expected. Rep. Jason Crow liked the talk about gun control and immigration, and Rep. Diana DeGette was glad he mentioned medical research and climate change. Sen. Michael Bennet appreciated a shoutout for the child tax credit, a major legislative priority of his. But the event was also an opportunity for the attention-grabbing Boebert to, well, grab attention. As Biden’s remarks turned to immigration, Boebert noisily unfurled a space blanket and draped it over her lap, doing so to bring attention to the flood of migrants who have overwhelmed detention facilities along the U.S.-Mexico border. The shiny silver blankets are commonplace there. The stunt earned the freshman conservative from Silt some coverage in right-wing news outlets and garnered confused tweets from mainstream news reporters. This was Fox News’ headline: “Boebert trolls Biden, Harris on border crisis by unfurling Mylar blanket.” Boebert tweeted nearly 30 times during Biden’s hour-long speech and two dozen times in the 12 hours after it ended, posting as late as 12:37 a.m. and as early as 5:04 a.m. ET. She wrote about everything from Hunter Biden’s substance abuse to jokes about the president’s mental acuity to questioning, “Why is Joe Rogan not allowed to give medical opinions but Bill Gates is?” To support the important journalism we do, you can become a Denver Post subscriber here.

Ask Us As The Spot mentioned last week, Democrats have been working on a package of gun bills since 10 people were fatally shot at a Boulder grocery store. On Thursday, we found out what those were. Rep. Kyle Mullica, who was the first in his family to go to college, said it was nerve-wracking to answer the legacy question — something like “has any member of your family attended this institution?” — during the application process. “No one in my family knew how to do (the applications) because no one had done it before and I remember coming up on the question … and the anxiety just kind of increased, wondering if that was going to hurt me,” the Northglenn Democrat said. Mullica attended the University of Denver on a scholarship for underserved students, and wants the process to get into college to be an “equal playing field” — including getting rid of fee waivers for students who’ve had family members attend a given institution. Enter HB 21-1173, which would make Colorado the first state to prevent legacy admissions at its public universities. While the issue may not be as prominent in Colorado as it is in states with Ivy League schools, Mullica’s goal is make sure students with more money or connections aren’t getting a leg up on first-generation students and immigrants with fewer resources. The bill passed the House earlier this month 43-20 with a handful of Republicans also voting in favor of it. It still needs to move through the Senate’s process. Driving while poor More than 100,000 Coloradans lose their driver’s licenses every year because of unpaid court debt or for failing to appear in court (something The Post wrote about in 2019). Fourteen states, including six in the west, have abolished the practice, and it’s a safe bet Colorado will join them soon, with lawmakers working to put together a bill to introduce as early as next week. People who lose their licenses because of outstanding debt are typically poor; they don’t delay payment out of negligence, research shows. When you lose your license, you may also lose your ability to work, and fall further behind on all sorts of bills. And maybe you drive regardless, flouting the law, because you have to make a living. Colorado State Patrol doesn’t like that latter scenario — lots of unlicensed drivers on the road — which is why it is championing the forthcoming bill and recruiting sponsors. Earlier this week: Andrew Boesenecker was sworn in to the Colorado House to replace the vacancy left by former Rep. Jeni Arndt, who is now the Fort Collins mayor. Read more on Boesenecker in this Coloradoan story. More Colorado political news The initial vote is in on a proposal to require Denver’s landlords to get long-term rental licenses for each of their properties. The concerns among the public are still out there. Renters are worried the measure would ultimately mean they’ll be paying more. And landlords griped that they’ll have to do costly repairs on their properties after inspections. City Councilwoman Robin Kniech addressed both Monday night. To ease complaints about costs possibly getting passed on, Kniech did some basic math. The application fee for a small “mom and pop” landlord would cost $50, Kniech said. And a typical inspection, required every four years, should cost about $150. That $200 total spread over four years comes to about $4 a month. “To me, that is not an exorbitant cost,” Kniech said. “If landlords are not already charging the maximum rent they can from tenants that would surprise me.” Next, she confirmed that the inspections are meant to ensure minimum housing standards like proper ventilation, heating and fire safety. “This not ‘Is every piece of your building code up to date.’ This is ‘Is there heat? Is there electricity and lighting? Is there water?’” Kniech said. “If those things are not in place you have no business operating a rental unit in our city today.” Kniech said she wanted to clear the air on those two topics before the council’s second and final vote Monday night, which will include a (likely contentious) public hearing. If the measure passes, landlords would not be required to obtain licenses until Jan. 1, 2023.

146,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Z60JJ4rse3s/,"Vice President Kamala Harris told an audience Thursday just how dark things she felt things were in America when she first took office. “Our Democracy was under assault and our Capitol had just been attacked by insurgents,” she said, referring to supporters of former President Donald Trump storming Capitol Hill on January 6th. The line from Harris shares a similar message from President Joe Biden’s address to Congress on Wednesday, as he described the riot on Capitol Hill as “the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.” Harris spoke after visiting a vaccination site at the M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore and declared significant progress for the Biden administration in its first 100 days. “Things are looking up,” she said. “America is once again on the move.” She credited the administration’s successful vaccine effort across the country for giving more people confidence about returning to normal life. “Whoever you voted for, light is at the end of the tunnel, we can see it but it is we who create these moments,” she said. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and other Democrat members of congress joined the vice president for the visit as well as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R). Dr. Anthony Fauci also joined the tour. “It’s always a wonderful day to spend time with Dr. Anthony Fauci,” Harris said. She urged Americans to get vaccinated and get their friends vaccinated. “It’s time for each one of us to do our part,” she said. Harris promoted President Biden’s $6 trillion in proposed spending on infrastructure, clean energy spending, more free government education, and the expansion of social welfare programs, including the $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan. “Some said it was too big, but we went for it anyway, and the American people rallied around it,” she said. Harris said the pandemic had taken a toll on the physical, mental, and financial health of American families and promised the administration would work to provide relief across the spectrum. She said the administration would focus on helping working parents get childcare, free universal pre-school and community college, affordable broadband internet, and the replacement of lead pipes in homes. “President Joe Biden, he had a clear vision and a clear purpose, and he never forgets who we are doing this for,” she said.
But Harris noted there was still work to do on issues of gun control, racial justice, and gun control. “There have been too many days when we woke up to news of another mass shooting, another black or brown person shot by the police, another act of hate against Asian Americans, another law designed to make it harder for people to vote,” she said.

148,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/29/joe-biden-100-days-georgia-rally,"President promoted his $4tn plans to rebuild crumbling US infrastructure and expand the social safety net at drive-in rally Last modified on Fri 30 Apr 2021 19.08 BST On his 100th day as US president, Joe Biden spontaneously lowered his black face mask, leaned towards the microphone and shouted: “Go Georgia, we need you!” It was a fitting moment in a state that has more claim than most to be the ground zero of a potentially transformative presidency.  Biden had just marked the 100-day milestone with a drive-in rally in Duluth, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, to promote his $4tn plans to rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure and vastly expand the government’s social safety net. Troubled by a cough, and briefly interrupted by protesters demanding an end to private prisons, the president gave an abridged version of his speech to a joint session of Congress the previous evening. But he paid particular attention – and gratitude – to an audience that has played an outsized role in the making of his administration. Towards the end of his campaign, he visited Warm Springs, the Georgia town that helped Franklin Roosevelt cope with polio. Come election day, Biden became, by a narrow margin, the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992. Then on 5 January, unexpected runoff wins by Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Georgia gave Democrats the balance of power in the Senate. If Republicans had retained control, Biden’s first hundred days would have looked very different. Jonathan Alter, the author of The Defining Moment: FDR’s Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope, said on Thursday: “Without the Georgia runoffs, you would not have that transformational presidency. It would be a completely different story. If 6 January is an important date in American history, so is 5 January because of those Georgia runoffs and none of what’s happening would be possible without 5 January.” Ossoff and Warnock joined Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, on stage at Thursday night’s rally. The four joined hands and held them aloft as the song (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher boomed from loudspeakers. Georgia has become a bellwether in a nationwide battle over voting rights. More than a hundred corporations, as well as civil rights organisers and sports leagues, spoke out against restrictions passed by Georgia’s Republican state legislature. Biden condemned the curbs as “just wrong” and called for Congress to pass nationwide protections. Last month Atlanta was the scene of a mass shooting in which eight people died, including six women of Asian descent, helping prompt Biden to take executive actions for gun safety and denounce hate crimes. Long a Republican stronghold, Georgia is now a diversifying swing state that will feature closely watched races for Senate and governor next year. It will almost certainly be one of the most competitive states during the 2024 presidential campaign. With a US national flag behind him, Biden told supporters gathered around vehicles: “Because of you, we passed one of the most consequential rescue bills in American history … You changed America. You began to change America and you’re helping us prove America can still deliver for the people.” That meant, he said, a hundred days that included the creation of 1.3m jobs, more than other president in history over the same period. It meant food and rental assistance, loans for small businesses and an expansion of healthcare. And, he said, the US is on course to cut child poverty in half this year. The president went on to tout the biggest jobs plan since the second world war, building infrastructure, replacing lead pipes to ensure clean drinking water and expanding broadband internet to rural areas. Tackling the climate crisis, Biden added, will “create millions of good paying jobs”, going on to repeat a line from his address to Congress: “There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.” Biden also pushed his new $1.8tn families plan that includes free universal preschool, free community college and support for childcare. “I was a single dad for five years,” he said, recalling the death of his first wife in a car crash and how he had to depend on family members because he could not afford outside help. Republicans have questioned how Biden intends to pay for his bold plans. He insisted: “It’s real simple. It’s about time the very wealthy and corporations started paying their fair share … No one making under $400,000 a year is going to pay a single additional penny in tax.” In an emotional finale, Biden told the crowd: “Folks, it’s only been a hundred days but I have to tell you, I’ve never been more optimistic about the future in America.” America’s on the move again. We’re choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, light over darkness. Biden, who has further campaign-style stops planned in Pennsylvania and Virginia in coming days, is enjoying popular support in opinion polls. A survey by Navigator Research found positive approval among 86% of Democrats, 61% of independents and even 59% of Republicans. Two-thirds of the public believe Biden’s pandemic-related policies have had a positive impact. Navigator also conducted three online focus groups with low-income Republicans and Democrats across the ideological spectrum in Florida, Nevada and Texas. The comments included a man from Florida saying, “I don’t feel like I have to doom scroll through my feed to see what the next thing is,” and a Nevada man commenting, “Almost immediately as soon he took office, everything just kind of calmed down and everyone’s like, ‘OK, we have a normal person there’.” But Republicans in Congress have condemned Biden’s spending spree, suggesting that he is exploiting the pandemic to smuggle in liberal imperatives and that his promise of bipartisanship rings hollow. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, told Fox News: “We’re friendly. We’ve done deals together in the past. However, the reason we’re not talking now is because he’s not trying to do anything remotely close to moderate. “Think of it as the Biden bait-and-switch. He ran as a moderate, but everything he’s recommended so far has been hard left. Bernie Sanders is really happy. He may have lost a nomination, but he won the argument over what today’s Democratic party is – more taxes, more spending, more borrowing.” Earlier on Thursday, the Bidens visited former president Jimmy Carter, 96, and his 93-year-old wife, Rosalynn, at their home in Plains, Georgia. It was at least the third occasion this month on which Biden has spoken with one of his predecessors, following conversations with George W Bush and Barack Obama about withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. Biden was the first senator to endorse Carter for president in 1976. Carter’s defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 ushered in an era in which calls for smaller government and lower taxes for big business and the wealthy were embraced as key to economic growth. Alter, also the author of the Carter biography His Very Best, said: “Biden wants to have a foreign policy that’s based on human rights and that goes back to Jimmy Carter. “He doesn’t want to have an Iranian hostage crisis but in terms of the aspirations for American leadership in the world, and standing up for American values in the world, that really does date from Jimmy Carter, who is no longer in bad odour in the United States, particularly in the Democratic party where in the past Democratic nominees have not really been thrilled to be associated with Carter because he lost in a landslide. “But that was more than 40 years ago. The sting of Reagan’s landslide has worn off and part of what Biden is selling is a partial return to the pre-Reagan political universe.”",2021-04-29 20:24:04,‘You changed America’: Biden marks first 100 days in Georgia – a state key to his victory,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
149,https://www.mic.com/p/in-his-first-address-to-congress-biden-took-on-the-countrys-vices-guns-police-brutality-75509555,"President Biden's first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday evening was a decidedly low-key affair for what is ordinarily an occasion for high pomp and circumstance. With attendance hampered by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Biden's speech â clocking in at just under and hour and a half â was delivered to a sparsely occupied House chamber, in which the usual trappings of a presidential address felt decidedly muted. Nevertheless, despite the overall underwhelming atmosphere surrounding Biden's most consequential speech since his inauguration, the president's address contained a number of significant moments, signaling this administration's priorities moving forward, including â in some of the evening's most bluntly emotional moments â a demand for the government to finally deliver on the longstanding promise of genuine gun reform. ""I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America,"" Biden declared, demanding an end to the ""boyfriend loophole"" that allows domestic abusers to own firearms. ""The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the eight victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado,"" he continued. ""In the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America."" Biden also called for universal background checks and a ban on ""ghost guns,"" which are weapons built from kits without identification numbers and other traceable markings. And in a moment of rare deviation from the speech's overwhelming message of bipartisanship and commonality, Biden took aim at the GOP for standing in the way of what has time and again been shown to be an astonishingly popular initiative among the general public. ""I don't want to become confrontational,"" Biden said, ""but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."" ""Donât tell me it canât be done,"" he added, in reference to the gun control bills passed under the Clinton administration when Biden was in the Senate. ""We did it before, and it worked."" Biden's speech also briefly touched on the swelling calls for racial justice and police reform that characterized this past summer, and which have only grown in recent months with the police killing of Daunte Wright outside Minneapolis, just days before former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd this past spring. ""It was nearly a year ago, before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter,"" Biden said. ""She's a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye. And she looked at me and she said, 'My daddy changed the world.'"" ""Well,"" Biden continued: ""After the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was if â if we have the courage to act as a Congress."" He went on to call for the Senate to pass the ""police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already,"" in reference to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021, which was narrowly voted through the House in March. Notably, while that act does ban chokeholds like the one used by Chauvin to murder Floyd on the federal level, it merely predicates federal funding for local police departments based on their use of the technique. In other words, even if the bill were to become law, there's no guarantee it would have saved its namesake's life. With a nod to Republicans' ""own ideas,"" Biden paraphrased Rev. Theodore Parker's iconic line by urging Congress to ""bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice"" and pass the Floyd act ""next month"" by the anniversary of Floyd's murder.",2021-04-29 11:35:59,"In his first address to Congress, Biden took on the country's vices: guns and police brutality",,109076,http://mic.com/

The march, dubbed Papeles Si, Migajas No (Papers, Not Crumbs) was organized by Movimiento Cosecha, an advocacy group fighting for permanent protection, dignity, and respect for all immigrants in the United States. According to a Facebook event announcement, more than 600 people are expected to attend the march. The march also comes as President Joe Biden hit 100 days in office. The advocacy groups want to hold him accountable on immigration reform policy pledges and demand that he act on protections for undocumented families, Dara Marquez, a Cosecha Indiana volunteer field organizer told IndyStar. ""We have a new president, a new administration and we're there to remind the country and the president that he has failed to deliver on his promises to the immigrant community,"" Marquez, 27, said. ""There isn't a focus on all 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. They are shifting focus to piecemeal legislation that still criminalizes many people in our community."" Four minutes at FedEx: Inside the terror of Indianapolis’ deadliest mass shooting in 15 years And in Indiana, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to help immigrants Hoosiers, Marquez said. As of 2018, nearly 100,000 undocumented immigrants call Indiana home, according to data by the American Immigration Council. And 40,000 of those reside in the Indianapolis, Carmel, and Anderson metro area. That year, undocumented Hoosiers paid an estimated $151.7 million in federal taxes and $111 million in state and local taxes in 2018. Immigrant workers comprised 7% of the state's workforce. But undocumented people in Indiana don't qualify for any state or federal aid. Last year, when the coronavirus pandemic left many unemployed and in need of healthcare, Cosecha Indiana, along with the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance and other Indiana immigrant advocacy groups, raised more than $50,000 to help undocumented families seeking funds to help pay for housing, food, and health care. Advocacy groups are also still working to push the Indiana General Assembly to pass a form of legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to drive legally in Indiana. Bipartisan Senate Bill 319 — which would allow the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles to issue driving cards and driving card learner's permits to residents of Indiana who cannot provide proof of identity and lawful status in the United States — did not move forward this year. The advocacy groups are mobilizing to push the legislative council to assign an interim study committee on the issue at the Statehouse this summer. Spanish-language podcast: WISH-TV's Camila Fernandez aims to reach Latinos Marquez said it was important for Cosecha Indiana to join the march in Washington, D.C. to put Indiana's undocumented immigrant community on the map. ""In Indiana, we've always been very quiet and very polite locally and nationally. And these 80 people that are going say they are glad we're doing this, that we are speaking up and creating these spaces,"" Marquez said. ""Our main thing through Cosecha has been visibility. We're not always the ones who are given the mic and so for us going to D.C. and mobilizing like this will have a huge impact to our community in Indiana.""

151,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/30/florida-school-district-superintendent-parkland-shooting-resigns-robert-runcie,"Robert Runcie stands down amid corruption inquiry as some claim he is a victim of political foes who blame him for 2018 massacre The head of the Florida school district that saw the nation’s deadliest high school shooting is standing down amid a secretive corruption inquiry and competing claims that his downfall was orchestrated by political foes who blame him for the loss of 17 lives. Robert Runcie, superintendent of the Broward school district for nine years, confirmed his resignation on Thursday, just over three years after a former student killed 14 teenagers and three staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school (MSD) in Parkland.  Runcie, 59, was arrested on a felony perjury charge a week ago, accused of lying to a grand jury that was ordered by Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, to investigate the 14 February 2018 mass shooting. The panel later widened its inquiry into school safety issues and alleged mismanagement of hundreds of millions of dollars of district funds. Runcie has pleaded not guilty and earlier this week announced his intention to stay on, in a video message sent to parents and employees of the country’s sixth-largest school district. “I am confident that I will be vindicated, and I intend to continue to carry out my responsibilities as superintendent with the highest degree of integrity and moral standards as I have done for nearly 10 years,” he said. But a special meeting of the nine-member Broward school board, which includes two relatives of Parkland shooting victims, elected after the shooting, discussed suspending or firing Runcie on Tuesday. Having lost the confidence of the board, Runcie announced he would stand down from his $356,000-a-year position. Also resigning is the district’s long-serving legal counsel, Barbara Myrick, 72, who was indicted on a felony charge of unlawful disclosure of grand jury proceedings, which she denies. “I know you’ve been in enormous amounts of pain that none of us can ever imagine,” Runcie told Lori Alhadeff, a board member whose daughter, Alyssa, 14, was killed at her school. “I guess I’m part of the source of that in some ways. If it’s going to give you the peace you’re looking for, I will step aside,” he added. His words were condemned by Alhadeff’s fellow board member, Debra Hixon, whose husband, Chris, was the MSD athletic director. “To drop that on Lori’s lap and say, ‘I am sacrificing myself for you’ was so disingenuous and disrespectful to those of us that lost people on February 14 [2018],” she told ABC10 news. Alhadeff was one of Runcie’s most vocal critics on the board, and several of the Parkland families blame him for creating the conditions that they believe allowed the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, then 19, to return to the school from which he had been expelled and commit the killings with an assault rifle. He is charged with murder. After vandalizing a middle school bathroom in 2013, Cruz was assigned to the district’s Promise program, a Runcie-endorsed diversionary initiative that allows students who commit non-violent misdemeanors to avoid a criminal record. Other Parkland parents have been critical of the program. DeSantis empanelled the grand jury in February 2019, a month after taking office and suspending the elected sheriff of Broward county, Scott Israel, whose deputies hid as the shooting unfolded. Israel was later fired, but DeSantis conceded he had no authority to remove Runcie. Precise details of the charges against Runcie and Myrick have not been disclosed, amid the secrecy of the grand jury inquiry. In court filings, the Florida state attorney’s office appears to link them to the arrest of the Broward school district’s former information chief Tony Hunter, who was arrested in January and charged with bid rigging and bribery over a $17m technology contract. Hunter denies the charge. Speculation has also centered on a controversial $800m bond program approved by voters in 2014, which was intended to fix dilapidated school buildings but which is years behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget. Runcie’s lawyer, however, is certain the case is politically motivated. “This grand jury proceeding was not searching for the truth about what’s happening with construction projects, the bond issue, the MSD murders, or anything else in the Broward county schools,” Johnny McCray told the Florida Courier. “It’s all about one thing: running Robert Runcie out of the Broward county school district by any means necessary.” Runcie, who is Black, won several awards and earned praise in the years before the shooting for helping to close the achievement gap between white and minority students. When he took over in 2011, only 61% of Black students reached graduation in Broward county compared with 81% of whites, a disparity that had narrowed to a little more than 10 percentage points by 2018. In that time the 261,000-student district as a whole achieved an all-time-high graduation rate above 90%. During his tenure, the superintendent forged close ties with business and religious leaders and community groups representing minorities, many of whose leaders appeared at a support rally for Runcie in Fort Lauderdale last week. “You have a community that stands with Bob Runcie, a community that questions this indictment,” the mayor of Miramar, Wayne Messum, said. Runcie and Myrick appeared before an emergency meeting of the Broward school board on Thursday, at which the panel authorized the chair, Rosalind Osgood, to begin negotiations over the financial terms of their departure. An interim superintendent is expected to be appointed soon.",2021-04-30 06:30:31,Head of Florida school district home to Parkland shooting resigns,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
152,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/30/first-thing-how-were-bidens-first-100-days,"Biden marked a significant presidential milestone, the US reflects on the first 100 days and looks to the next. Plus, dozens have been killed in a crowd crush in Israel Last modified on Fri 30 Apr 2021 11.31 BST Good morning. Biden marked his 100th day as US president with a rally in Georgia yesterday, a state that played a leading role in getting him to the White House. The drive-in event in Duluth, north of Atlanta, was an opportunity to promote his plans to overhaul US social infrastructure, with Biden giving a shortened version of the speech he delivered to congress the night before.  Why Georgia? A traditionally Republican stronghold, Georgia unexpectedly came through for Biden in 2020. But Georgia has also become the battleground for the fight over US voting rights, and last month the state had a mass shooting in which six women of Asian descent were killed, along with two others. This was instrumental in Biden’s action for gun safety and against hate crimes. As he passes the significant milestone, attention is focused on what Biden achieved in his first 100 days, and what we can expect from the rest. How has he delivered on his main priorities? When Biden took office, he outlined four significant crises facing the US: the coronavirus pandemic, the climate crisis, the economy, and racial inequality. How has he fared in tackling them? Daniel Strauss looks at his approach to each. What did the rest of the world make of Biden’s first 100 days? From the EU’s palpable relief that the US was back on board with the fight against the climate emergency, to Russia’s confusion about how to approach Biden, our reporters around the world ask what the world’s big players think of the Biden administration. At least 44 people have been killed and 150 injured in a crowd crush at a religious gathering in Israel, one of the country’s worst peacetime disasters. Tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews had gathered at Mount Meron for all-night prayer, songs and dance. The cause of the crush is not clear, but witnesses said crowds were asphyxiated or trampled when exiting via a sloped passage. Footage shows men pulling down corrugated iron walls to escape, and medics have since confirmed that children are among the dead. Here’s a run down of what we know so far. Witnesses described their terror as pilgrims fell over one another trying to escape, and people died around them. The event was the first large-scale religious gathering held legally since Israel lifted almost all of its coronavirus restrictions. Scientists have discovered more than 25,000 barrels of what is thought to be chemical waste, off the California coastline. They believe the barrels contain DDT waste, which has been linked to cancer and disease, and also to mass die-offs of animals. The barrels cover a seafloor area double the size of Manhattan. The discovery has caused alarm, and renewed scrutiny about the dumping of toxic waste near California, which continued into the 1970s. You can read more about the discovery and history of the chemical waste here. Certain US news outlets that are aligned with an anti-Chinese state religious movement are promoting conspiracy theories about Democrats and election fraud to Trump supporters, according to a media watchdog. Falun Gong is a movement that has been involved in a decades-long conflict with the Chinese state. Outlets including the far-right Epoch Times appear to be trying to connect Biden and the Democrats with the Chinese Communist party and turn US public opinion against China. US emergency aid has arrived in India as the country grapples with a surge in coronavirus cases that has overwhelmed the healthcare system. More than 400 oxygen cylinders and other hospital equipment and nearly 1m rapid coronavirus tests arrived in Delhi on Friday, as India set yet another global record for new daily cases. Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers released a picture showing her bruised face and alleging she is being held in worse conditions than other inmates in prison due to her links with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and concerns that she is a suicide risk, something her lawyers deny. Her lawyers suggest she was injured while having to cover her eyes with a sock or towel at night because guards flash light in her cell every 15 minutes to make sure she is breathing. Five people have been arrested over the dognapping and shooting of Lady Gaga’s dog walker – including the woman who returned the pups. Detectives don’t believe that the thieves knew the dogs were Lady Gaga’s, and that they were stolen for their value. Aid agencies have said that a “rapid and accelerating” wave of coronavirus is putting millions of people in Syria at risk, with poor healthcare infrastructure after 10 years of war and about 90% population steeped in poverty. In the north-east of the country, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. A number of states including Washington and New York are passing laws to end the era of gasoline and diesel cars. Biden has regularly talked of the environmental and economic benefits of electric cars, but is now being pushed by state governors to go further and impose an outright ban on new gasoline and diesel car sales – as the UK, France and Norway have pledged to do.

Things are getting even stranger down in Maricopa County, where an audit of Arizona’s 2020 election results is underway. The “Stop the Steal”-linked firm Cyber Ninjas, which has been hired by the Arizona GOP-led Senate to conduct the audit, is using UV lights among other technology to detect any possible election fraud. (They haven’t found any yet, and it’s been a week.) On Thursday, the group accidentally published its top-secret security brief that raised concerns about a firebombing attack from “Antifa.” The document has since been taken down. Meanwhile, the “Crazy Times Carnival'' is kicking off Friday at the Arizona State Fairgrounds in Phoenix, incidentally the same approximate location where the audit is taking place. The carnival, which will offer such rides as “Puppy Roll,” “Alien Abduction,” and “Circus Train,” is being eyed with growing suspicion from the audit’s most ardent supporters, who fear it could be a Trojan horse for an “antifa” incursion. Given these “vulnerabilities,” the Arizona Senate and Cyber Ninjas agreed that the audit should receive additional security from the National Guard and the Department of Public Safety. Arizona’s governor denied their request. Sidney Powell, the ex-Trump lawyer and Stop the Steal proponent who has dabbled in QAnon circles, forwarded a post to her nearly 500,000 followers on Telegram urging them to bombard the Arizona State Fair with phone calls and force them to shut down the carnival. “We already saw Craigslist ads recruiting ‘protesters’ earlier this week,” the post warned. “Don’t underestimate the lengths they’re willing to go to stop this audit.” “Carnival’s in town?” someone replied. “I bet their [sic] democratic Antifa BLM activists in disguise.” The original poster had also attached screenshots from an old Craigslist “ad” seeking “actors” to pose as anti-Trump protesters for an event at the Phoenix Convention Center, located about three miles from the Veterans Memorial Coliseum where the carnival and audit are taking place. Wild conspiracy theories about Crazy Times Carnival have also been swirling on 4Chan all week, hyping the possibility of a “false flag” mass shooting or bombing at the carnival, which would take place with the goal of disrupting the audit. One person found it suspicious that the Carnival event was hosted by WordPress. The Crazy Times Carnival also comes up in the Cyber Ninjas security plan, which identifies five security vulnerabilities, including a “public event” in the southwest corner of the grounds of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, by a six-way intersection. One particularly grim scenario envisioned by Cyber Ninjas involves “Antifa” firebombing a nearby chemical and tank storage farm and then blocking traffic in the six-lane intersection near the carnival and preventing police and fire trucks from responding to the scene. “Such a condition would compound distractions, causing a significant safety concern to the small carnival operating in the South-West of the Fairground Campus, and allowing near unmitigated access and entry/breach to hostile actors,” according to the report. They also raised concerns that militias could swing by the audit and be a disruptive presence. The election audit is highly controversial because it’s grounded in the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. He’s said to be taking a keen interest in the goings-on in Maricopa County, inquiring about its progress multiple times a day, the Washington Post reported.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Tom King, president of the NY State Rifle and Pistol Association, discusses the gun law he is challenging on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ David Chipman, President Biden's nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has some questionable ideas on gun suppressors and assault weapons. Gun control advocates have praised the nomination of Chipman, who was an ATF special agent for 25 years and currently serves as senior policy adviser to gun violence prevention group Giffords, highlighting the significance of the ATF director's role in enforcing gun laws. Gun rights advocates, on the other hand, have expressed alarm at Chipman's stances on gun-related topics, including suppressors and assault weapons. ""Anyone who has worked in law enforcement for as long as I have will tell you that silencers were not designed to protect hearing, they were designed to make it difficult for people to identify the sound of gunfire and locate active shooters,"" Chipman said in a 2017 statement. Americans for Responsible Solutions (ARS), a gun violence prevention group where Chipman previously served, said in a 2017 tweet opposing the Hearing Protection Act that earplugs protect gun owners better than silencers. Gun suppressors tweet (Twitter) A Washington Post fact check gave the claim a rating of three ""Pinocchios."" Conversely, during a 2017 congressional hearing on the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, the ATF nominee asserted that a person would ""absolutely"" need to wear ear protection while using a suppressor ""if they cared about their ears."" Alan Rice, a firearms instructor and New Hampshire state director of Gun Owners of America, said gun suppressors are ""absolutely designed to protect hearing."" BIDEN ATF PICK ALARMS GUN RIGHTS GROUPS Suppressors have been around for about a century, and people use them on a range of firearms, including hunting rifles and home defense guns, Rice explained. ""If you have a home invasion in the middle of the night, you don't want to defend yourself and lose your hearing. ... You want to defend yourself and keep your hearing,"" he said. ""In a stressful situation ... I know someone is not going to reach for earmuffs."" He added that suppressors are not like those shown ""in the movies""; they do not silence guns. Instead, gun owners use suppressors to lower the decibel of the sound a firearm makes when it goes off ""to a level that will not damage hearing."" Giffords Law Center Senior Policy Adviser David Chipman speaks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on assault weapons on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Chipman, however, said in a 2019 interview with the Virginia-Pilot, after 12 people and a gunman were fatally shot during a mass shooting in Virginia Beach, that a suppressor ""makes a gun sound sort of like a handgun."" The gunman used a legally purchased suppressor attached to a .45-caliber handgun before carrying out the massacre, prompting local and federal politicians to draft gun reform legislation banning suppressors. Later in 2019, Chipman told NPR that the primary purpose of a suppressor ""is for someone who is on the offensive to maintain the element of surprise longer."" BIDEN ANNOUNCES SLATE OF GUN CONTROL ACTIONS, CLAIMS 'PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS' Rice refuted this and brought up the Virginia Beach mass shooting as an exception in his explanation of suppressors. He said that when Gun Owners of America analyzed active shooters across the country, if found most criminals do not use suppressors. ""Criminals don't really use suppressors,"" he said. ""Criminals are sneaky people, and they want to hide their guns. Suppressors make guns much longer...and more difficult to hide."" Additionally, most armed criminals do not want to go through the process of legally obtaining a firearm, which can take up to a year in some cases, Rice said. People who want to purchase a suppressor in the U.S. need to go to a Class 3 federally licensed gun dealer, chose a suppressor, fill out an application with personal information, provide photo ID and fingerprints, submit the application with a $200 fee to the AFT and wait for the ATF to approve the application. Gun silencers or suppressors are becoming increasingly popular in the real world as hunters and other gun owners adopt them for hearing protection. (Reuters/ Jim Urquhart) ""A person who wishes to buy [a suppressor] needs to go to a Class 3 gun dealer, pick one out, fill out a form with all kinds of personal information, provide [photo ID] and fingerprints, and they have to submit the form with a $200 payment to the ATF, and the ATF will approve or deny sale with no time limit,"" Rice said. He added that even with suppressors in the equation, most people are able to identify the sound of gunfire. ""It doesn't make a gun sound like a nail gun,"" Rice said. According to documents obtained by the American Accountability Foundation, Chipman authored a beginner's guide to firearms called ""Firearms 101"" in collaboration with gun violence prevention group ARS and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence that mislabels several guns as ""assault weapons."" BIDEN TO TARGET 'GHOST GUNS,' STABILIZING BRACES IN NEW GUN CONTROL ACTIONS The guns presented in Chipman's guide under the label of ""assault weapons"" are not classified as such under federal law. Guns are classified by their functions and components as defined in chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code. Two of the guns categorized in Chipman's presentation are categorized as National Firearms Act (NFA) firearms. A fully automatic AK-47, for example, is classified as a ""machine gun"" under the NFA. A semi-automatic AK-47 is classified differently and can fall under the category of a rifle. Similarly, an AR-15 can be classified as a pistol, rifle, short barrel rifle and so on depending on its functions and components. ""Firearms 101"" slide (Credit: American Accountability Foundation) Rice noted that Chipman's labels resemble the 1994 definition of the term based on the decade-long Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the manufacturing, distribution and sale of more than a dozen different semi-automatic firearms and features that resembled fully automatic, military firearms. The Federal Assault Weapons Ban definition differs from the more traditional definition of an assault weapon, which is a military firearm that can switch between semiautomatic and fully automatic fire. ""The ammunition was the same or even less powerful than a common hunting rifle, but the common hunting rifle had a different outward physical appearance,"" Rice said of the weapons included in the 1994 definition. Rice believes ""assault weapon"" is a ""junk term coined by people who disagree with citizens owning any firearms whatsoever,"" he said.

""I am a proud and responsible gun owner, as are millions of Virginians,"" Chipman wrote. ""I am also permitted to carry a concealed handgun.

156,https://io9.gizmodo.com/racism-is-how-you-get-shows-like-the-falcon-and-the-wi-1846791627,"Though film and television studios have historically been slow at making concerted efforts at diversifying their industries, when it comes to Black people, you can see the demonstrable progress that’s been made in Hollywood. Without a doubt, there are more Black people working on various projects, and more nuanced depictions of us in the media. On the whole that’s a good thing, but just because progress has been made doesn’t mean it’s all good. Series like Disney+ and Marvel’s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier speak to what comics fans have long since known since at least the Wesley Snipes’ Blade era. There’s always been interest in Black comic book characters across a variety of media, and after feigning ignorance about that fact under the guise of playing “the long game,” major film studios have capitalized on that interest in big ways with more recent adaptations. But those projects are only a piece of the larger moment in Hollywood, one that’s elevating Black stories in response to the concerted criticism of decades of sub-par representation, and the general public’s heightened focus on ongoing organizing efforts to abolish racist systems that disproportionately harm and kill Black people and other marginalized communities. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier isn’t unique in attempting to tackle these issues through a science-fictional lens, and other series like HBO’s Lovecraft Country and Amazon’s horror anthology Them speak to the studios’ interest in this general kind of approach. But a number of these series have debuted at a time when their messages couple with an uneven grasp of how to explore these themes carefully. It’s something that’s made more than a few of them disappointments when they didn’t have to be. On March 16, 2021, three days before The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’s first episode premiered on Disney+, six Asian women were counted among the eight left dead following a mass shooting at Atlanta-area spas by a white man many believe was specifically targeting Asian people. Marvel’s head writer Malcolm Spellman has recently—and somewhat dubiously—made claims of prescience about the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol shaping The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’s finale. Despite this, something the show’s creative team couldn’t have predicted was the show debuting the same week of a national tragedy that highlighted the recent spike in anti-Asian racism and harassment in the U.S. As the premiere, “New World Order,” followed Bucky Barnes’ (Sebastian Stan) life in the present while he worked through the trauma of his time spent operating as the Winter Soldier, the episode repeatedly flashed to moments in the past that show you exactly what sort of darkness haunts the former Hydra asset. Though Bucky’s largely freed of the evil group’s influence as the series begins, he still recalls many of the innocent lives he unwittingly took on its orders, acts that he doesn’t truly know how he could ever atone for as part of the healing his therapist  wants him to do. The show also established how Bucky befriended his neighbor Yori Nakajima (Ken Takemoto) in his attempts at building a healthy social life. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier doesn’t go into great detail about how they became friends beyond the fact that they’re both elderly curmudgeons who understand Japanese. Yori knows that he enjoys Bucky’s company, and that’s enough for him. What Yori doesn’t know is that Bucky is the person who murdered his late son RJ Nakajima (Akie Kotabe) during one of his Winter Soldier missions. Given Bucky’s backstory, there were multiple ways that the plot might have gone about exploring the difficult, ugly truths he’s kept secret from one of the few friends he’d managed to make post-Avengers: Endgame. But all of that was quickly put on hold as The Falcon and the Winter Soldier shifted its focus to other characters; Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), John Walker (Wyatt Russell), and Lemar Hoskins (Clé Bennett) were all introduced with their own plots about pain, power, and social justice that were addressed over the course of the season. Time is a precious commodity for all television shows, but particularly so for ones like this Marvel project which was rather explicit about its desire to address racism through the lens of a heightened, superheroic narrative. Other shows like Luke Cage and Black Lightning have done this in the past, as have movies like Black Panther and (in a metaphoric way) a number of the X-Men movies. Fiction lends itself to the exploration of these sorts of large-scale societal issues that shape our reality in ways that can be difficult for some to comprehend. It’s exactly why the canon of genre fiction, in particular, is dense with stories coming at these ideas from different perspectives. The tradition of using science fiction to talk about real-world social issues existed long before the recent wave of stories like Them, Us, Two Distant Strangers, Lovecraft Country, and Watchmen, which were all clearly influenced by Get Out’s success. Jordan Peele’s story felt very much like the result of the creator’s efforts to synthesize well-known (to Black people, at least) elements of anti-Black racism and his own love of the horror film genre into a wholly original idea that was greater than the sum of its narrative parts. But for many of the stories following in Get Out’s wake, like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, the arithmetic hasn’t added up quite like that, and it’s important to understand why because many of these stories are presented as entertainment meant to also educate audiences about complicated ideas. Subjective as art is, it can be hard to pinpoint precisely what it is about one story delving into race that makes it stronger than another, but often it boils down to whether you can feel if both the story and its creators are actively thinking past the basic “racism + a genre framing device” formula. In chasing Get Out’s success, a number of studios seemingly lost sight of the reality that the movie wasn’t good simply because it was a “Black horror movie” about racist bodysnatchers. What made it stand out was how it spun elements of reality into a twisted fable we could all recognize as social commentary about the most dangerous kind of “Good White People.” Looking back at the 2017 film, it’s interesting to consider how much of the hype around it was tied to what people “learned” from the movie as opposed to audiences’ simply being shocked to see a mainstream horror film approach race in such an inspired way. It’s often felt like the educational components of these stories have become more of the hook for people, whether it’s through borrowing beats from the news and creators’ lived experiences (like in Black Lightning) or by making historical events like the Tulsa massacre crucial to the plot (like in Watchmen). What both of those shows understood that The Falcon and the Winter Soldier did not was that in order to really say something beyond “racism is bad,” it is necessary to push characters to repeatedly contend with and contemplate how race and racism have shaped the world around them. One of the dangers shows like these have to be mindful of is becoming too charmed by their own premises to actually make an interesting point, which was often the case in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. You could also see the same problem in Them, Amazon Prime’s horror series—created by Little Marvin and executive produced by Lena Waithe—about a Black family fleeing North Carolina for Los Angeles, only to find themselves in another kind of racist hell that’s haunted by otherworldly apparitions. Though the show wanted to be a reflection on the Second Great Migration that saw millions of Black people trying to start new lives in the North  after leaving the South, it quickly became far too preoccupied with finding new horrors to inflict upon its protagonists—horrors that served little function as commentary on the racism the show was supposedly about. Between the dozens of venomous utterances of the N-word delivered by Them’s white cast, multiple depictions of rape and murder, and an ultimate reveal (spoiler warning) that the devil’s one of the reasons white racists are racist, Them became a cornucopia of traumatic images devoid of substance. All the while, the series was seemingly patting itself on the back for being brave enough to commit Black trauma to film. Netflix’s now Oscar-winning live-action short film, Two Distant Strangers, quickly veered into similar territory in its Groundhog Day-inspired tale that followed a day in the life of a Black man who’s murdered by the police moments after stepping onto the street first thing in the morning. It’s easy to see what Two Distant Strangers was going for—a short, direct, punch to the gut about what it means to live in constant fear of being murdered by the police for no reason other than existing while Black. After forcing you to watch its protagonist die over and over again, the movie lands on an even darker note that’s presumably meant to leave viewers feeling a fraction of the pain that many Black people live with, knowing there’s essentially nothing they can do to keep the police from murdering us in cold blood. But one’s also left to wonder what the film was hoping to accomplish other than receiving recognition from the Academy, a body with a storied history of only responding to Black stories centering on pain. Similar pitfalls were present in HBO’s Lovecraft Country, which had a tendency towards trying to keep more spinning plates in the air than it was able to within its story, one that juxtaposed garden-variety American racism with Lovecraftian horrors from other dimensions. There are sparks of very good ideas present in all of these stories—including The Falcon and the Winter Soldier—but the issue is many of them failed to earn the amount of labor they were asking of audiences to power through in their heavier, uglier moments. Much as the Disney+ series generally failed Sam Wilson in the sense that it didn’t depict him as being an especially proactive person when deploying his past experiences to navigate the present, Carl Lumbly’s Isaiah Bradley brought a much-needed degree of nuance and truth to the show’s commentary on Blackness in America. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier needed to delve into the specific horrors of the real-world Tuskegee experiments that inspired Isaiah’s origins as an American super-soldier to be effective. The character urging Sam to consider what all it means to carry Captain America’s shield given all of its bloody, unjust history was one of the few moments where the writing felt bold enough to tackle the realities of how people have to engage with historical racism, rather than just talk about it in carefully worded speeches delivered on national television. What little potential there was in Isaiah’s plotline was cut off at the knees, though, by The Falcon and the Winter Soldier not doing more with the character, and because of which characters it did end up choosing to spend more time with. To listen to the way Spellman and director Kari Skogland talk about Wyatt Russell’s John Walker, one could easily miss the fact that one of the character’s pivotal scenes involved him murdering a man by bashing his skull in with the famous shield for something he didn’t do. The show’s internal logic reasoned that Walker witnessing his best friend Lemar Hoskins’ murder at the hands of the Flag-Smashers’ leader would push him over the edge into a dark space. However, in following that train of thought, the show became guilty of perpetuating one of the very problematic tropes it was implicitly critiquing. Arguing that Lemar “had” to die in order to push John forward fails to take into consideration that, within the context of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, these characters aren’t just regular military personnel running around, and the Flag-Smasher’s murder wasn’t just a twisted superhero taking down an unnamed villain. In quite unsubtle ways, Walker became the show’s equivalent to a trigger-happy cop attacking someone they deemed to be a threat and using an obviously excessive and lethal amount of force—something he ultimately faces no real consequences for. Though a villainous turn could easily be in Walker’s MCU future, one really has to consider what’s to be taken away from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’s creators speaking about Walker as if he’s a character you’re meant to sympathize with, given what he’s experienced. By the end of the series, we see him palling around with Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and it’s played somewhat for laughs, with a promise of a future that  undercuts the show’s mealymouthed attempt at saying “Black Lives Matter.” It didn’t feel like Lemar’s life mattered to The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. In his death, and the way its gravity was glossed over, you could see how the show’s creative team assumed it was unnecessary to stick with the thread, either because it wasn’t that bad or because there were better outcomes for other Black characters. That sort of formulaic thinking can be useful to figure out how stories will take shape, but in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’s case, it only highlighted how mismanaged the story’s attention was. In the case of Sam Wilson, the MCU’s new Captain America, the story continues as he fully owns his new mantle in Marvel’s next Captain America film. The stakes of what comes next for him could present an interesting opportunity for the studio go to bigger and harder with the character—as it’s already shown to be possible with movies like Black Panther—but it shouldn’t really be Sam Wilson’s job to bear the burden of being Marvel’s signature superhero who’s constantly combating racism. There are going to be more stories like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier that want to talk about the world we live in, and they should, but they’re going to have to be more than simple declarations of basic truths about evil we should already all know.

                    Wyatt Mayes On April 15, a 19-year-old opened fire at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, killing eight people. The shooting ended when the man killed himself. Authorities haven’t identified a motive behind the shooting, but when they released the names of the victims, four were recognized as part of the city’s Sikh community. Police also said that about 90 percent of the employees who worked at the FedEx warehouse are also a part of the local Sikh community. The shooting echoed the familiar pangs of tragedies that Sikhs have experienced in the U.S., including a 2012 shooting, when a gunman opened fire inside the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six. The series of attacks targeting the Sikh community are driven “by some sort of racist bias, some idea that these people don’t belong here, and [that] they are inferior to us,” Simran Jeet Singh, a senior fellow at the Sikh Coalition, told the PBS NewsHour’s Amna Nawaz. Watch the discussion in the player above.

Photo by Jeff Dean/AFP via Getty Images In the weeks since the April 15 shooting, the Sikh Coalition, along with other Sikh groups, have called for greater transparency from police and FedEx during the shooting investigation, along with calls for gun reform. The local Sikh community is also holding a remembrance on Saturday, May 1, to honor all eight lives lost in the mass shooting. Jeet Singh, who had been in contact with victims’ families in Indianapolis, spoke about how the community is processing their grief and why racism isn’t relegated to just one area of the country. “These things are always there, always shifting,” Jeet Singh said, adding that “one thing that doesn’t change is the pain.” The conversations with the families of those killed at the FedEx facility have been hard because, in part, it’s not just the Sikh families in mourning, he said. Those who don’t identify as Sikh also lost loved ones. We take a moment to remember the lives lost in the recent FedEx shooting. While we still don’t know about the suspect’s motive, half of those killed were Sikhs. Simran Jeet Singh, a senior fellow at the Sikh coalition who is connected to the Indianapolis community, joins Amna Nawaz to discuss. “I’ve been thinking about that a lot this past week — just the reality that hatred and violence in this country — it doesn’t just affect those who look different and those who are typical targets. You can get any of us at any time, and we’ve seen that over and over again,” Jeet Singh said. “I think just grappling with loss and grief, a week later, there is some moving forward within these communities, but there are still a lot of questions in terms of what was driving this person to massacre innocent people, many of whom were his former coworkers.” Jeet Singh said he can speak to this not only as a Sikh American who was born and raised in the U.S., but also as a person of color that comes from a marginalized community. “It’s hard in this country, when you have attacks like this, not to feel targeted and not to at least raise the question of whether bias was involved. And that is such a sad state of affairs,” he said. “It speaks to where we are as a country, that immediately [when] I received news of this attack and so many others did around the country, we started asking the question of what drove this person to kill us.” Since the shooting, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has revealed that in March 2020, authorities had conducted a mental health check for suicidal ideation with the suspect, identified as Brandon Scott Hole. His mother had told police that she was worried that her son wanted “suicide by cop.” Authorities, at the time, flagged that the Hole had viewed white supremacist websites on his computer, IndyStar reported. While he was detained, police also confiscated a firearm. Jeet Singh said it concerns him to think that racist bias may have played into the attack. He described his experiences growing up in Texas and living in New York City and “knowing when people see me walking down the street that they have certain assumptions about who I am and what I’m about — and a lot of times those assumptions are negative and a lot of times those assumptions are wrong.” “Just living that way, every day, in the skin, in my turban and knowing the context, the lived experience, the history — all of these things together, it really makes us ask the question of what was in this person’s heart, what drove them to do this, and when will we be safe? I think that, to me, is the real animating question,” he added. Jeet Singh said when he moved to New York from Texas, he was hopeful he would be leaving racism behind. “I knew it was a diverse city. I knew it was cosmopolitan. I thought that maybe racism was limited to those who just hadn’t had exposure or didn’t have knowledge about people who were different,” he said. But, he said he was in for a shock when he got to New York. “In retrospect, I shouldn’t have been surprised. But I really was by the kinds of things people would say to me on the street.” Jeet Singh described one of his earliest memories: Soon after he moved in, an elderly woman fell outside his apartment. He went over to help her up, and held out his arm. She reached out to grab it, but when she looked up and saw him, she pulled her arm back and said, “Go back to where you came from.” “I was stunned for a second because here she was — she was in danger, she was in the middle of the street in New York City — but she would have rather been hurt [by oncoming cars] than to be helped by someone who looked like me,” Jeet Singh said. A vigil in Indianapolis was held on April 18 to remember the victims of a mass shooting at the FedEx facility. Photo by Jeff Dean/AFP via Getty Images The moment stuck with him because “that’s the problem of racism in our country today: We’d rather continue to hurt ourselves and to be hurt and to be worse off collectively and individually than to allow other people into our lives and to humanize them.” “As much as we want to tell ourselves that racism isn’t true, it doesn’t live in our local communities — and I don’t want to admit that either, I wish it wasn’t that way — but I think we’re all better off when we acknowledge and accept our realities because that’s the only way we’re ever going to be able to move forward.” “Unfortunately, this is the pain of what it means to be human,” Jeet Singh said. “We all encounter pain and suffering in our lives, and we all do what we can in moments like these.” This shooting happens to be a particularly painful tragedy, he said, because the Sikh community feels targeted. “We’re not, as a society, actually acting in a way that helps us make each other safer,” he added. “That, to me, is part of it: You accept the reality of our own lives and the inevitability of the pain.” But, he also said that what he finds inspiring is the way the community comes together in times of need. For the Sikh community in particular, “this is part of our tradition that in times of need, we come together. We don’t do it alone,” he said. Jeet Singh said he spoke with a woman who lost her grandmother in the shooting and noticed it was noisy in the background. The woman told him that loved ones have been over since the shooting, saying that they just wanted to be together. “As we sit in this pandemic moment and we’ve all been disconnected from our loved ones, we can all identify with that reprioritization,” he said. “You feel it so much more viscerally when you realize that you’re feeling disconnected or at least that life is fleeting.” READ MORE: This PSA traces 150 years of anti-Asian hate in America By Amna Nawaz, Joshua Barajas, Wyatt Mayes By Joshua Barajas, Amna Nawaz, Wyatt Mayes By Amna Nawaz, Vignesh Ramachandran Amna Nawaz

158,https://pagesix.com/2021/04/30/dr-drew-pinksky-and-family-at-peter-luger-before-gun-fight/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. By Oli Coleman Submit April 30, 2021 | 5:37pm Dr. Drew Pinsky was having dinner at Peter Luger when gunfire broke out on Thursday night. And he tells the Post that he began turning over tables to make a barricade to protect his family and other diners. Two bystanders were shot at the legendary Williamsburg steakhouse Thursday night after a family feud ended with a 24-year-old man pulling a gun and firing at his rival. He missed and hit two people who were dining outside the restaurant. Pinsky tells us he was out for dinner with his wife, Susan, daughter Paulina and her boyfriend Zach Smotherman when they heard a commotion in a doorway and he noticed a woman with her head on the ground — who, it later transpired, was a staff member who had dived behind the counter to dial 911. As a medical professional, Dr. Drew says he made his way over to see if she needed help, but he was quickly pushed back into the dining room by waitstaff directing diners away from the melee and telling them to “get down.” Dr. Drew tells us he and his family joined around 40 other customers “in a pile” in the corner of the room. He said the family didn’t see the fight or the shooting — which happened on the sidewalk after the fight spilled out of the restaurant — but heard people yelling “911,” “someone’s down,” and “where’s the shooter?,” so they were aware there had been gunshots. Susan, we’re told, heard the shots go off. “You don’t know if it’s over or if it’s just starting,” Dr. Drew told us on Friday, saying there was no way to know if it was the beginning of a mass shooting or a drive-by. He added that it was very unclear where the shooting had happened. “There was a fire exit and we were thinking about whether we should go through it to escape, but for all you know, the shooting is happening right outside the door,” he said. Cops and ambulances arrived within moments of the ado erupting, Pinsky reported. Dr. Drew said that he turned a table over to begin to form a barricade to “prepare for a bigger siege,” but just as he was about to do the same with a second table, waiters came into the dining room to say that the situation was under control. The star of VH1’s “Celebrity Rehab” told us that the whole thing seemed to be over very quickly, and that he was surprised to find that he’d remained calm and clear-headed through the entire experience. He said he remembers looking at a nearby window and thinking, “If the shooting comes through that window, it’s going to be bad,” but that he hadn’t panicked. “It happened after the salad and before the steak,” Dr. Drew told us. “It feels strange to say it like that.” He said that when it was all over, “some people weren’t hungry,” but he added, “I was.” He said the table shared two of the restaurant’s famous steaks, and the Williamsburg joint comped everyone chocolate mousse and whipped cream for dessert. He said that throughout the ordeal, “the waiters were exceptional. They stood tall. They were calm.” “They should get a commendation.” Dr. Drew — who was visiting the Brooklyn institution for the first time — said that, shooting aside, he loved the experience. “I can’t wait to go back,” he told us. The two shooting victims, a 30-year-old struck in the shoulder and a 57-year-old hit in the stomach, were taken to Bellevue, where they are expected to survive. Frighteningly, Dr. Drew tells us that his family was going to be seated outside where the victims were sitting, but that he had “announced that I wanted the full Peter Luger experience and wanted to sit in the dining room” instead. Dr. Drew said he had been told that the shooter had been admitted to a psychiatric ward, and said the episode may be a chilling reminder of the nation’s problem with untreated mental health disorders.

@Arightside Armstrong Williams is a columnist for The Daily Signal and host of ""The Armstrong Williams Show,"" a nationally syndicated TV program. Growing up in rural South Carolina on my family’s farm, I developed a love, appreciation, and, most importantly, a respect for firearms. To this day, I remain a collector of firearms and a supporter of the American right to keep and bear arms as enshrined in the Second Amendment. I was taught that safety is paramount to gun ownership, so I have always encouraged responsible gun ownership and use for all Americans. With that being said, I have noticed a disturbing trend in our country: an ever-increasing number of shootings and gun-related deaths. And while the quick response from some, namely the left-wing mainstream media and liberal politicians, is to ban weapons and become more restrictive, it appears to me that we have serious mental health and poverty issues contributing to gun violence. I don’t believe that banning guns will result in any significant decline in shootings attributed to these two categories. In the United States, since January 2021, we have had 195 mass shootings, with 245 people dying and approximately 731 wounded, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. While it’s important to acknowledge that there is not a universally accepted definition of what constitutes a “mass shooting,” these numbers are staggering. They are some of the highest numbers in the industrialized world. Let’s contrast 2021 with when I was growing up, when mass shootings simply weren’t a problem. I believe that this is the direct result of the era and the family structure: Parents were involved in their children’s lives and children were taught discipline and respect. By and large, members of my generation were raised in households with two parents, and we were taught how to deescalate and talk things out when problems arose. Today, that no longer seems to be the case. We have a moral and social failing in our country that has caused an increase in mass shooters, predominantly young men. One has to pause to think about what’s different today from 30 or 40 years ago. It certainly isn’t guns, because it’s harder to get guns today than it was in the past, when you didn’t have to go through nationalized background checks. When I was growing up, you could purchase a firearm with no questions asked, yet we didn’t see so many mass shootings. America’s young men are struggling with mental health issues or are broken and living in poverty with single mothers struggling to survive. Many of them are clearly crying out for help, and we owe it to them to listen. Mental illness in this country has been stigmatized for far too long, so much so that many families are unwilling to confront their own past with it and certainly aren’t willing to acknowledge what their children may be experiencing. But even the families that recognize mental health issues might not have the resources or the know-how to get the proper help. This could all be changed at the federal level through more funding for treatment of mental illness. We also need program funding at the state and local level to assist schools with recognizing these signs early so that necessary steps can be taken to mitigate potential violence. Another important facet of this dialogue is religion. I know we don’t often talk about religion these days, but it instills moral and ethical values that are key to a society’s success. It creates boundaries that inform us of what is good and what is bad. Many of the greatest thinkers known to man have talked about the importance of morality and ethics for all civilized people, how they are key to a good life and setting boundaries against bad behavior. We often hear or read arguments from the left about inner cities, such as Baltimore or Chicago, being examples of violence run amuck that highlight the need for more gun control. However, proponents of these measures don’t always want to deal with poverty, family breakdown, education, or economic opportunities. When people are better educated, financially secure, and are happy with their family life and their community outlook, they are more likely to be constructive members of society and less likely to go down a dangerous path. Today, there is clearly a lack of pride, security, belonging, and ownership that is so fundamental to continued success of any society. If we start focusing on those things and truly tackle them without making excuses or trying to blame everything on the system, I am confident that we may actually be able to solve the root of the problem. We can acknowledge that we have a problem in our country with gun-related deaths and the young men who typically carry out such heinous acts. But with that discussion comes the responsibility to take a nuanced approach to finding the root of the problem. I can assure you that simply banning guns won’t solve this multifaceted problem. Tackling mental illness and the problems in our inner cities are the exact steps we should be looking to take. COPYRIGHT 2021 CREATORS.COM The Daily Signal publishes a variety of perspectives.

160,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/fedex-shooting-victims-remembered-big-ceremony-77432662,"Hundreds of people have gathered at a downtown Indianapolis football stadium to remember the eight people killed in a mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse INDIANAPOLIS -- Indiana's governor told members of the Sikh community and others who gathered at a downtown Indianapolis football stadium Saturday to remember the eight people killed in         a mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse  that he knows their anguish from the attack is far from over. The three-hour event at Lucas Oil Stadium came two weeks after a former FedEx employee fatally shot the eight people, including         four members of Indianapolis’ Sikh community, before killing himself. Authorities have not released a motive in the April 15 shooting. Under the stadium's open roof, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said in his opening remarks that the capital city “is still reeling from the impact of that dark night.” “Never in my wildest imagination did I see this day or this cause of gathering as a reason for our unification,"" Holcomb told the hundreds of people in attendance at the stadium where the Indianapolis Colts play. ""Why must any day be that dark? Why must tragedy strike and tear a community, tear humanity apart? This pain will for sure persist as we continue to live with the loss in all of our days to come.” In a letter read aloud during the ceremony, former Vice President Mike Pence emphasized particular grief for the Sikh community, whose members “add to the tapestry of this country."" “Know that our hearts and our prayers are with you all,” Pence, a former Indiana governor, said in his letter. “We join fellow Hoosiers across the state of Indiana and Americans across the country in expressing our heartfelt condolences. … You have been in our hearts since that horrific night, and you remain in our prayers today.” A monotheistic faith founded more than 500 years ago in India’s Punjab region, Sikhism is the world’s fifth-largest religion with about 25 million followers, including about 500,000 in the United States. Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said his message to the Sikh community, to immigrants and “to anyone who feels threatened by this act simply because of who they are” is that they are “welcome in Indianapolis, and it is the responsibility of every one of our residents to make sure you know that to be true.” Hogsett, a Democrat, also reiterated his previous calls for changes to gun policy, saying the shooting could have been prevented. He said the city, state and country are “far past due for transformative action.” Authorities have said that Brandon Scott Hole, 19, had two rifles that he was able to purchase legally, even after his mother called police last year to say her son might undertake “suicide by cop.” Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears          has faced sharp criticism for choosing not to pursue         court hearings that could have prevented Hole from accessing the guns. “When gun violence takes a life, it affects us all,” Hogsett said. Private services for victims from the Sikh community are also expected to take place in the coming week. The proceedings will begin with cremation, followed by up to 20 days of reading of the 1,400-page Guru Granth Sahib scripture. The victims' families were granted roughly two-dozen fast-tracked visas so relatives overseas can travel for the funeral rites, said Amrith Kaur, legal director at the Sikh Coalition. They're arriving just days before the         U.S. restricts travel from India — a response spurred by a rise in COVID-19 cases in the country and the emergence of potentially dangerous variants of the coronavirus. ——— Casey Smith is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

163,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/650510314/0/phoenix/nation~With-days-behind-him-Bidens-challenges-mount-and-expectations-rise-as-COVID-concerns-ease/,"WASHINGTON – From the moment he took office, Joe Biden made combating a raging pandemic the central focus of his presidency, deploying a wartime effort to distribute vaccines and laying out attainable goals to assure the public of progress. More than 100 days later, other challenges have moved to the forefront. Eased concerns in the USA about the pandemic have led to heightened demands from  key constituencies – particularly among liberals – for major action on gun control, policing changes to curb racial discrimination, overhauling President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies and more. Biden is pushing the most dramatic expansion of the federal government's social safety net in decades. He won congressional approval in March of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue bill loaded with spending to help the poor. He proposed a $4 trillion transformation of the U.S. economy with plans to rebuild infrastructure, invest in green technology, expand caregiving for seniors, subsidize child care, make prekindergarten nationwide and institute a national policy for paid family leave. Biden's American Families Plan in charts: What's in the plan with subsidized child care and free pre-K Now that Americans are more optimistic the tide is turning on the pandemic, Biden faces added pressure from the left to deliver beyond his COVID-19 response and economic agenda. If he doesn't, he risks alienating those who helped put him in office, support that could be critical for Democrats' efforts to maintain control of Congress in the 2022 midterms. ""Some people close to the Biden administration want to say he's already achieved the success of FDR and LBJ, and I would say we are nowhere close to achieving those aspirations,"" said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for Justice Democrats, a left-leaning political organization. Shahid applauded Biden's work to administer vaccines, his inclusion of climate efforts in his infrastructure package and the decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. But he said progressives expect more action on health care, such as lowering the age eligibility threshold for Medicare, transitioning to clean renewable energy, adopting a $15 minimum wage, overhauling policing, expanding voting rights and passing comprehensive immigration reform. ""The administration's focus – and the whole country's focus – has been on getting through this pandemic,"" Shahid said. ""As more and more people get vaccinated, as the pandemic hopefully subsides, there's more urgency to touch these issues that there's been no action on for several years."" That urgency is fueled further by the looming 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats will defend their slim control in Congress. Biden used his first address to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night to push for several liberal causes. He set an ambitious goal of May 25 – the anniversary of George Floyd's death – for the Senate to pass policing legislation named in the Minnesota man's honor that would bolster police accountability and prevent problem officers from moving from one department to another. The bill, which cleared the House in March, would end certain police practices that have been under scrutiny amid high-profile shootings of Black Americans by officers. ""We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America,"" Biden said Wednesday. ""Now is our opportunity to make some real progress."" 'It can't stop here': Biden, after Chauvin verdict, calls for passage of George Floyd bill Biden is set to meet with House and Senate leaders from both parties May 12, giving the president an opportunity to discuss the infrastructure and families plans and negotiate police changes. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether Biden plans to invite Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C, who leads Republicans' negotiations on police changes, to the White House. ""I think he’s going to push more on policing in the future, but we have to hold him accountable,’’ said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League. “There’s a lot more left to do. The unfinished business is longer than the finished business.” For more than 30 years, Biden said in his speech, politicians have talked about immigration reform. ""It's time to fix it,"" he said, calling for members of Congress to pass legislation to secure the border and establish a pathway to citizenship. After a series of deadly mass shootings since he entered office, Biden called for the Senate to pass legislation to strengthen gun background checks and reinstate a ban on certain weapons and high-capacity magazines. ""I don't want to become confrontational,"" Biden said, ""but we need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues"" to pass gun control. Republican lawmakers have shown no willingness to support gun control or immigration changes and drew a hard line against H.R. 1, slamming the Democratic-backed voting rights bill as a power grab. Unless unlikely compromise is reached, Biden faces a seemingly impossible legislative path to pass these measures because of the threat of the filibuster from Republicans that would require 60 votes in the evenly divided Senate to overcome. “The president of the United States is not is not a dictator. He can't just wave a wand and achieve things,” said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., adding that Biden still continues to push efforts to address voting rights and health disparities. “But it's hard. You need to get Congress to act.” More: Biden holds out for bipartisan support for immigration measures, White House says These bills face a tougher climb than Biden's COVID-19 rescue plan, which Democrats in Congress approved through a process called budget reconciliation without any Republican support. Biden could seek passage via the same legislative route with his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan – as long as all Democrats stick together in support. If Democratic-backed legislation is blocked by Senate Republicans, it could fuel more outcries from the left urging Biden to support getting rid of the filibuster. Though he called the filibuster a ""relic of the Jim Crow era,"" Biden has stopped short of saying the tactic should be eliminated. He did express support for bringing back the ""talking filibuster"" that is more difficult to execute. ""Over time, it's only going to get more difficult for him,"" said William Howell, a political scientist and professor at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. He said the COVID-19 relief package had the best chance for success. Biden's infrastructure and families plans are a harder lift. ""Then when you look down the pike: Comprehensive immigration reform? Gun control legislation?"" More: The House passed a sweeping voting rights act. What's in it? Howell said the big question is whether Biden will consider ""democracy reform,"" such as overhauling the filibuster. ""There's just not a world,"" he argued, where Biden would pick up 10 Republican votes needed to achieve the progressive agenda. ""If he wants to make headway on those, he's going to have to start talking about reforms to the legislative process itself,"" Howell said. ""That would be a game changer."" Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University, said Biden has ""reaped the benefits"" of his response to COVID-19. An ABC News/Washington Post poll this week found 64% of Americans approve of his handling of the pandemic, higher than his overall approval rating of 52%. As the country moves past the pandemic, she said,  activists will ""be less patient with the administration"" on issues they care about. Liberals viewed Biden's early executive actions on racial equity, for example, as the beginning, not the end, of action. ""It's an important tonal shift. But I think – not just in the next 100 days but in the 1,000 days – the expectation will be that some of these initial steps were just the groundwork to large projects,"" Gillespie said, predicting protests by the end of the year if Biden doesn't deliver more. Gillespie said progress doesn't hinge only on success in Congress. She said Black voters who backed Biden in the election want to see him and the Justice Department tackle racial discrimination in ways that don't require legislative action. Flipping the page after four years of unpredictability under Trump, Biden brought rigid scheduling and routine back to the White House. He's made his presidency more defined by policy than personality, another sharp break from his predecessor. Biden has spoken less in public than past presidents, including Trump, according to Vanessa Beasley, associate professor of communication studies at Vanderbilt University who studies presidential rhetoric. He's held few one-on-one interviews, waited 64 days to hold his first news conference and nearly 100 days to deliver his first joint address to Congress. Beasley called the strategy an ""intentional move"" to put the spotlight on policies and Biden's push to restore faith in government – not Biden himself. It's been successful so far, she said. ""The most basic rule of political communication is that if something works, keep doing it,"" Beasley said. But the political landscape will probably become thornier as expectations rise. ""In a way, it's the Reaganesque morning in America. Everybody's going back to work,"" Beasley said, referring to the progress made to fight the pandemic. ""But what that does for expectations is huge. And a huge part of the presidency is managing those expectations."" Contributing: Deborah Barfield Berry Reach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.

Joe Biden faces more difficult days ahead, with pressure ramping up for him to do more to fundamentally change the systems that perpetuate racism and inequality. By
      
        Ryan Brooks Posted on May 1, 2021, at 11:07 a.m. ET On his first day in office, President Joe Biden declared that advancing “equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity” were the responsibility of the federal government in an executive order. The order, which has become an integral part of the administration’s work, tasked federal agencies with assessing whether their practices perpetuate inequality and acknowledged that systemic racism has historically created inequities. But the early days of Biden’s presidency have been consistently interrupted by reminders of the very racism and violence he’s tasked the government with rooting out — and how difficult it will be to change the systems perpetuating racism rather than just softening their effects. Biden faces a historically intricate and overlapping number of issues to enact his agenda: a razor-thin margin in the Senate and mounting calls to drastically overhaul the rules; a hyperpolarized nation and opposition party; public disagreements with influential activists on the direction and scope of his reforms. Biden views his presidency as one that can drastically improve the lives of people of color, but his ideas of drastic improvements and how to achieve them and the progressive movement's are often far apart. While the administration sorts through the tangle of issues it inherited, a relentless onslaught of acts of white supremacy, extremism, and police brutality continues every week. In March, after six Asian women were among those killed in an Atlanta-area mass shooting, a prescheduled trip to Georgia for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly shifted from focusing on the pandemic response to the prejudice Asian Americans have historically faced in the country. Just a month later, on April 21, Biden delayed more remarks about the pandemic as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd. Speaking from the White House, Harris and Biden echoed the sentiments they’d made a month earlier, speaking about Black Americans historically fearing for their safety. The administration’s jaunts between the pandemic and racial violence in these speeches are indicative of its push to address systemic racism and the long fights ahead in the polarized and intricate political system it inherited. Those efforts have included policy proposals that target at-risk and marginalized communities. It also empowered federal agencies like the DOJ, which has increased federal oversight of police departments and launched multiple investigations under Attorney General Merrick Garland. One hundred days into those efforts, anti-racism activists who supported Biden’s campaign say they’re motivated to keep pushing to widen the scope of the administration’s response but have grown skeptical as many proposals shift out of the White House and into Congress, where they face significant roadblocks. “Joe Biden and his administration have gotten into this thinking that perhaps his administration can be a FDR-style administration that is able to leave an indelible and transformative imprint on the American economy and democracy like a real transformative president,” Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, said. “When the president says that he wants to focus on structural racism, we believe him and we share from our perspective what that looks like.” Activists have pushed back against the administration’s proposals and called for specifics on how the 40% of funding in Biden’s infrastructure plan will go toward “disadvantaged communities.” They’ve also highlighted their dissatisfaction with the policing reforms the administration has urged Congress to pass after the Chauvin verdict. Biden has described the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would ban chokeholds and create a national police misconduct registry, as the “first shot at dealing with systemic racism.” He urged Congress to pass the bill in his first joint address, but policing-reform advocates have opposed the proposed legislation. Policing-reform advocates have criticized the bill for providing more funding for police. In a statement released following Biden’s address, the Movement for Black Lives demanded his administration take “bigger and bolder action” to protect the rights and lives of Black Americans. A number of members of Congress and advocacy groups, including Black Lives Matter, the Movement for Black Lives, and the Working Families Party, have backed the BREATHE Act, an alternative bill that centers community-based approaches to safety by reallocating funding for police agencies. “The status quo is reflected in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act,” Amara Enyia, the policy and research coordinator for Movement for Black Lives, told BuzzFeed News. Many of the advocates who spoke with BuzzFeed News acknowledge that the prospect of passing key legislative priorities remains slim under the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to pass most bills. “My hope is that politics doesn’t get in the way of justice,” said Lisa Woolfork, a University of Virginia professor and organizer with Black Lives Matter Charlottesville who helped organize some of the counterprotests to the 2017 white supremacist rallies that Biden referenced in his campaign launch. “When we think about Biden’s position right now, he has both chambers. It should be a slam dunk, but nothing is slam-dunking. None of it has been easy, even though Democrats occupy a position in the majority that they haven’t in some time.” Woolfork and other activists have long been skeptical about the reality of Biden’s messaging of unifying the country, pointing to the heightened polarization that led to Donald Trump supporters storming the Capitol. Woolfork also recalled anti-protest laws in states like Florida, which grant protections to drivers who hit protesters, as evidence that the government has a long way to go before it can eradicate white supremacy. Susan Bro, the mother of Heather Heyer, the counterprotester killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, during the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally, said she understands Biden’s bipartisan approach toward legislation, but she’d also been skeptical of Biden’s message. Bro said she hasn’t spoken to Biden or the White House since he launched his campaign, but she appreciated that he’d urged Congress to pass legislation about hate crimes. She was surprised when it was approved by the Senate last month. “This seemed like a lifeboat,” Bro said of Biden’s presidency. “I think many thought that his very nature of being progressive and sort of middle of the road was going to help pull people back away from that other life raft.” During the first press conference of his administration, Biden told reporters that he agreed with former president Barack Obama that the filibuster is a “Jim Crow relic,” a shift from his previous position. He later said he supported reforming the rule to require senators to continuously speak on the Senate floor to delay voting on a bill if there were significant blockage to passing a law. Advocates pointed to the shift as a sign that the administration was listening to concerns. Progressive organizations and voters have been particularly frustrated with Democratic senators like Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, who still support retaining the filibuster. Deadlock in the Senate has also jeopardized key legislation around voting rights protections. Dozens of states have introduced or passed legislation that severely restrict voting rights access, including just this week in Florida. Biden has urged on the Senate to pass the legislation to combat the swath of bills and called the new voting law in Georgia a continuation of Jim Crow policies. On Thursday, a coalition of advocacy groups launched a campaign to demand that Biden and the Democratic Party pass voting rights protections through the For the People and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancements acts. The groups are demanding that Biden take steps to protect the right to protest and ensure that “no one else dies from racialized violence over the next 100 days of the Biden administration.” Nsé Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project, a group that has worked to register thousands of people to vote in a state that was critical to Biden’s victory, said she was pleased with the administration’s response to the introduced restrictions but “felt that there was more that could be done.” “This is a key issue to people’s ability to participate in our elections and send people to Washington, DC, who are accountable to our communities,” Ufot said, explaining that empowering people to vote has helped create proposals like Biden’s infrastructure plan. “I know that if we are to ever get that passed, or anything that's good for Black folks and people of color and working people in the future, we have to preserve the rights of both.” She added, “I’m not privy to these conversations, but I’m wondering if Sen. Manchin has heard from his president about the importance of the For the People Act and about what needs to happen to secure his vote.” Ufot said she believes the administration should be prepared for the Republican Party to attack aspects of their steps toward progress. “I’m grateful for the [administration’s] responses,” Ufot said. “I am looking for a response or a pushback or tactics or an effort that is as aggressive and as urgent as the threat that we are facing.” ● Ryan Brooks is a politics reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

166,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/sheriff-boone-shooter-attacked-father-days-earlier-77439270,"Watauga County Sheriff Len Hagaman says the shooter who killed two deputies and two civilians in Boone this week also threatened his father with a knife recently US reeling amid rise in mass shootings RALEIGH, N.C. -- A gunman who killed his mother, father-in-law, two sheriff's deputies and died at the scene of a shootout also attacked his father with a knife days before Wednesday's shooting in Boone, North Carolina, according to Watauga County Sheriff Len Hagaman. In interviews late Friday night and Saturday afternoon, Hagaman said the shooter's father reported his 32-year-old son, Isaac Alton Barnes, first to the Avery County Sheriff's County on Sunday and then called Watauga authorities after being referred to that department since the encounter took place within county limits in the town of Matney. He accused his son of pulling out a bowie knife and trying to harm him. The father, Joseph Barnes, was trying to decide whether to have Isaac arrested for the alleged assault or pursue an involuntary commitment. The father then went to a magistrate but decided not to pursue the involuntary commitment, according to the sheriff. Joseph Barnes did not immediately respond to a phone call and text message seeking comment. Hagaman said that before the mother and stepfather were killed, they had contacted his office on Monday out of concern for their son. Family members warned the county sheriff's office that the son was experiencing a mental breakdown and could be dangerous if approached. In the meantime, Watauga County dispatchers warned officers on Sunday and Monday to be on the lookout for Isaac, who had fled to the woods along the Avery and Watauga County border after allegedly assaulting his father. “They were trying to find Mr. Barnes, who was in essence, in the woods somewhere,"" Hagaman said. ""Camping out isn’t the right word, but he was hiding in the woods or staying in the woods. Nobody knew exactly where he was. When that report came from the dad of the allegation of brandishing a weapon, then that’s when we decided, ‘Well, if he’s in the woods maybe wait him out and see if he’ll come out.' But he never did. The follow-up to that was what led to our deadly encounter with him.” When Barnes' mother and stepfather, Michelle and George Wyatt Ligon, didn't show up to work or respond to calls on Wednesday, Sgt. Chris Ward and K-9 Deputy Logan Fox were sent to 553 Hardaman Circle at 9:44 a.m. to perform a welfare check. Upon arrival, they saw two cars outside the home belonging to the family and suspected the couple was inside. After knocking on the door and entering the house, they were met by an unexpected visitor. “They were walking from the main level downstairs. That’s when Mr. Barnes shot the officers,"" Hagaman said. After backup forces arrived, a diversion was created and a small rescue squad pulled Ward out of the house. A Boone police officer was hit by gunfire during an initial rescue attempt of the deputies, but was uninjured thanks to a ballistic helmet. Ward got into a helicopter and was flown to a Johnson City hospital, where he later died. He was 36 years old. Fox, 25, died at the scene and was in the house throughout the 13-hour standoff. Hagaman said Barnes fired shots from several parts of the house, but when gunfire stopped for about 30 minutes, authorities sent in a robot that showed someone lying on a bed, though they didn’t know who it was. After deploying tear gas and seeing no movement from within the house, law enforcement officials entered the building. Around 11 p.m., Michelle and George Wyatt Ligon were found dead, though the time and date they were killed remains unclear. They were 61 and 58 years old, respectively. Authorities          previously said Barnes appeared to have died by killing himself, but that has yet to be confirmed, according to Hagaman. “Because it’s an ongoing investigation, we’re not able to share any specific details beyond what’s already been shared at this point,” said a statement from Angie Grube, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. A public service will be held for the fallen deputies at 3 p.m. on Thursday at the Appalachian State University Holmes Convocation Center in Boone, according to Carolyn Austin, co-owner of the Austin & Barnes Funeral Home. Doors will open for public seating at 1 p.m., and attendees should wear a face mask. A pair of fundraisers a pro-law enforcement organization in North Carolina created on Thursday to support the families of         Ward and         Fox has generated over $180,000. It’s the largest fundraising drive Back the Blue NC has initiated since it formed in July 2020. Gadi Adelman, a spokesman for the group, said the shooting in Boone should serve as a reminder of how dangerous even a routine welfare check can be. “The majority of the police that are in the United States right now are men and women that care about their communities and put their lives on the line daily for those communities, such as what we just saw going on a simple welfare check and then not being able to go to their family at the end of the day,” Adelman said. Despite the tragedy, Hagaman suspects the death toll could have been much higher and impacted the broader public. He said Barnes didn't leave behind a note at the scene of the crime but knows from the shooter's family members that the gunman owned a “large cache” of weapons, which may have been intended for a mass shooting. “The blessing in the death of the two officers was that he (Barnes) was confined, albeit with four victims, and not out in the neighborhood or anywhere else,” Hagaman said. ——— Follow Anderson on Twitter at         https://twitter.com/BryanRAnderson. ——— Anderson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

171,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/01/vaccinated-faithful-throng-jerusalem-church-for-holy-fire/,"Trending: JERUSALEM (AP) — Hundreds of Christian worshippers made use of Israel’s easing of coronavirus restrictions Saturday, packing a Jerusalem church revered as the site of Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection for an ancient fire ceremony a day before Orthodox Easter. The faithful gathered at The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, waiting for clergymen to emerge with the Holy Fire from the Edicule, a chamber built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was buried and rose from the dead after being crucified. Only a few people in the church wore masks, and there was no distancing. Entry was restricted to those who were fully vaccinated. As bells rang and the top clerics from different Orthodox denominations appeared, the worshippers scrambled to light their candles and pass the fire on. Within a minute, the imposing walls of the old church glowed. The source of the flame is a closely guarded secret. Greek-Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem Theophilos III led the event. The scene at the church was a stark contrast to last year’s, when only a handful of religious leaders held the centuries-old ceremony in a near-empty setting enforced by the coronavirus pandemic. Israel has significantly lifted most restrictions, including mask-wearing in public, after a world-leading vaccination drive. However, air travel to the country remains limited and requiring quarantine. In normal years, Christian holidays, including Christmas and Easter, draw tens of thousands of tourists and pilgrims to holy sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Many countries will be restricting normal Orthodox Easter celebrations. Neighboring Lebanon for example went into a round-the-clock curfew to curb the spread of coronavirus, from Saturday until Tuesday morning. Churches will be allowed to hold Easter mass and prayers only at 30% capacity, and require special permits. In Egypt, home to the Middle East’s largest Christian community, primarily of the Coptic denomination, churches were told to limit attendance to 25% or less. Worshippers in Cairo’s Coptic cathedral wore face masks and sat a meter apart in pews to mark the start of the celebration on Saturday evening. Related Articles

Those four minutes, late on a Thursday night when some FedEx workers were on the dinner breaks and others were picking up their checks, shattered not only the families of those lost, but also Indianapolis’ tight-knit Sikh community. The burden of the tragedy has fallen squarely on the shoulders of those left behind but Saturday served as opportunity for members of the wider Indianapolis community — politicians, officials, members of other faith traditional and average Hoosiers alike — to lighten that load. “It makes us feel like we're not alone,” said Komal Chohan. Chohan is the granddaughter of Amarjeet Kaur Johal, one of the eight victims. “We don't know if this was bias related. It feels good to know that not everybody views us in that manner and not everybody sees us as outsiders. In moments like this, we do feel like maybe we can call this our home as well.” Four minutes at FedEx: Inside the terror of Indianapolis’ deadliest mass shooting in 15 years There are an estimated 5,000 Sikhs in Central Indiana and 10,000 in the state, according to local community leaders. Though Sikhs began settling in Indiana more than 50 years ago, the first gurdwara or Sikh temple, was not established until 1999. There are 10 in the state now. Police have not identified a motive for the shooting, yet. It’s unclear if the shooter, a former employee at the facility, was targeting Sikhs. There are a high number of Sikhs, immigrants and refugees who work in the facility. Seeing so many people, especially from outside their community, come out to support the community was moving Chohan said. Two weeks after the shooting, it’s only now starting to feel real that this happened to her home, that her grandmother is gone. More than a job: What FedEx in Indianapolis meant for many Hoosier Sikhs “There's been so many mass shootings happening, and you see it on the news but you never think it’s going to hit your home,” Chohan said. “She was the most gentle person and for such a gentle person to go out in such a violent manner &mldr you just don't even wish it on your worst enemies. To be scared and alone &mldr to die alone. Nobody wants that.” More than 100 people gathered for Saturday’s memorial service, held at Lucas Oil Stadium, to remember Johal and the other seven victims. They were Matthew Alexander, Samaria Blackwell, Amarjit Sekhon, Karli Smith, John Weisert, Jasvinder Kaur and Jaswinder Singh. For more than three hours, those gathered paid tribute to them and elected officials from around the state and the country offered to lend their support as the community starts the long, difficult process of healing. “We're left wondering why pain this deep could ever be inflicted,” said Gov. Eric Holcomb. “We’re left wondering, why must any day be that dark? Why must tragedy strike and tear your community apart?” Holcomb praised Sikh’s commitment to community service and recalled how the Sikh community jumped into action in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to sew handmade masks when there was a shortage. Several of Indiana’s congressional representatives sent letters of support that were read aloud from the sun-soaked stage constructed on the 50-yard-line. The roof of the stadium was open to reveal a nearly cloudless blue sky. Others recorded, including officials from around the country, recorded video messages. Red flag law expert: FedEx shooting example of 'devastating effect of a failure' Former Vice President and Gov. Mike Pence could not attend, the organizers said, but sent a letter, as did his brother U.S. Rep. Greg Pence. Pavan Singh, one of the event hosts, said the Pence family helped get visas for family members to attend the funerals."" President Joe Biden also wrote a letter of support, delivered in-person and read aloud by Erika Moritsugu, deputy assistant to the president and Asian American and Pacific Islander senior liaison. “To the people of Indiana, I share the heartbreak you are experiencing after such senseless violence pierced your community and our nation’s soul once again,” Biden wrote. “They were our friends and neighbors. They were immigrants and fellow Americans, seeking their own piece of the American dream.” Mayor Joe Hogsett told the crowd he was not just their mayor, but also their brother and their servant. Indianapolis is a city, he said, “made of people brought together in the middle of our country, from every different background but in a common cause and for a common purpose.” The victims of this mass shooting, two other mass shooting earlier this year and the growing number of victims of gun violence in the city “deserve better,” Hogsett said. In addition to the elected officials, nearly a dozen leaders from various faith traditions were in attendance, sharing messages of hope, faith and love — things the community will need as it continues to process its grief. Chohan said it took time for it to even feel real that she lost her grandmother, especially in such a traumatic way. Only at her funeral did it start to sink in, she said. “I'm here today to continue to tell her story. I'm here today to demand justice. I'm here today to unify the community, not just the Sikh community or the Indian community, but Indianapolis. “This is going to be a huge part of our lives for a while.” Call IndyStar education reporter Arika Herron at 317-201-5620 or email her at Arika.Herron@indystar.com.

Police in Wisconsin said they fatally shot a gunman who opened fire inside a casino in Green Bay, killing two and injuring a third in what has been described as a targeted shooting. The shooting broke out at the Oneida Casino and prompted a massive law enforcement response. Brown County Sheriff's Lt. Kevin Pawlak said investigators believe the gunman was targeting a specific person he was angry at, but the person wasn't at the casino at the time. The gunman ""decided to still shoot some of the victim's co-workers or friends, it appears,"" Pawlak said. A witness told Fox 11 that he arrived at the casino's parking lot and spotted people running from the location. The witness – who described the sound of rapid gunfire – said they saw about 50 to 60 police cars rushing to the scene. The casino's crowd was likely larger than normal since Saturday was the running of the Kentucky Derby. Videos posted on social media showed people fleeing into the parking lot, where multiple police vehicles can be seen with their lights flashing.

The NRA filed for bankruptcy in January, in part to get out from under investigations into its dealings by the New York attorney general’s office. In the middle of the back-and-forth lawsuits between the NRA and its former piggy bank (and public relations consulting partner) Ackerman McQueen, the pro-Second Amendment organization was hit with another lawsuit from the producers of a show claiming they were left in the lurch after the NRA closed down its NRATV channel in 2019. Producers on a long-running program called Under Wild Skies alleged the NRA had not fully paid them for all of the shows that were produced for the gun group. This is not the the most unique example of scumbaggery heard of in the entertainment business. However, the NRA’s lawyers argued that the show’s producers were asking for payment on two episodes that were not completed. Under Wild Skies LLC’s attorneys said that their clients had indeed completed those shows but that they were “not released at the sole direction of Wayne LaPierre.” It took about eight years but The Trace and The New Yorker have gotten their hands on the footage that was buried. It is somehow worse than expected. There has been a lot of speculation as to what footage was contained in these shows that would lead Wayne LaPierre to scuttle the episodes. What was known was that the shows starred Wayne LaPierre and his wife Susan hunting down, killing, and gloating over the largest land mammals on Earth—African bush elephants. What was also known was that the LaPierres went to go hunt these elephants about one year after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. But simply hunting big game animals has never seemed to be something the NRA considered bad public relations. The NRA and MAGA Republicans across the country have made it very clear that their opinions on what the Second Amendment of our Constitution is takes precedent over the shooting of school children. Shooting elephants in a faraway land is unlikely to register for people like the LaPierres. Still, there was speculation that at least part of the reason for this revision of hunting history had to do with Wayne LaPierre’s media kit boasting to membership: As a skilled hunter, from Chesapeake waterfowl to African Cape buffalo, Wayne understands the key role hunters play in wildlife conservation. Over the years, he has led NRA efforts to preserve the integrity of the Pittman-Robertson Act, spearheaded NRA programs for young shooters and hunters, and fought for the access of sportsmen and women—including the disabled—to public lands for hunting. It looks like the skilled hunter bit might be what was hurting Wayne’s teeny-tiny soul. The footage was shot in Botswana. Wayne LaPierre is guided to a spot from where he can shoot an elephant. LaPierre is unable to hear the guide telling him to wait, as he is wearing earplugs to protect his ears from the sound, and shoots the elephant. Unfortunately, Wayne LaPierre isn’t good at hunting things, it seems, and the elephant is not dead, just immobilized on the ground. LaPierre is directed to shoot the still-breathing animal while it lies on the ground. The guide points to where he wants LaPierre to shoot. From just a few feet away, LaPierre takes two shots at the poor animal, and while hitting the animal, still does not kill him. The guide says to LaPierre, “I’m not sure where you’re shooting.” LaPierre seems frustrated, asking where he is supposed to shoot the animal. The guide even asks LaPierre’s travel buddy Tony Makris, a C-suite executive at the NRA’s former PR firm Ackerman McQueen, if he wants to finish off the poor animal for LaPierre. LaPierre says he can do it, and from point-blank range, shoots the elephant for a fourth time. He misses the mark. Makris finally steps in and takes the kill shot, and like the PR dirtbag he is, turns to LaPierre and says “You dropped him like no tomorrow.” Susan LaPierre’s section of the video shows her to be a better shot and better listener than her husband. Her experience culminates with her cutting off the tail of the fallen elephant she killed. Unlike her husband, Susan seems genuinely enthused and emotional and grateful for the experience itself. I’m not a hunting person, and outside of the need for hunting to balance eco systems or for food, I find it an archaic pursuit. That being said, as little as I like people like Susan and Wayne LaPierre, at least Susan seems to really want to murder things for some perverse sense of accomplishment. But Wayne … I just don’t know what he’s doing with his cold, dead hands. Makris was a producer on the show, which originally aired on NBC. The show was canceled by NBC in 2013 after Makris shot an elephant in 2012 and said his critics are “like Hitler.” NRATV took on the show, which was why this expensive little jaunt took place. According to The Trace, elephant hunting in Botswana costs tens of thousands of dollars and while the footage never aired on the show, Susan made sure to get her trophies sent secretly to her and Wayne: “The Master Airway Bill was in the name of a taxidermist, whom Makris’s company paid to turn the animals’ front feet into stools for Wayne and Susan’s home.“ Warning: The video below is graphic.

""Officials are currently working to clear out the casino."" The casino announced it is closed.   Firefighters scrambled Friday to control a raging inferno in southeastern Oregon that's spreading miles a day in windy conditions, one of numerous wildfires across the US West that are straining resources. Crews had to flee the fire lines late Thursday after a dangerous ""fire cloud"" started to collapse, threatening them with strong downdrafts and flying embers. An initial review Friday showed the Bootleg Fire destroyed 67 homes and 117 outbuildings overnight in one county. Authorities were still counting the losses in a second county where the flames are surging up to 4 miles (6 kilometers) a day.                President Bashar al-Assad was sworn in Saturday for seven more years after a controversial May election dismissed by Europe and the US as ""neither free nor fair"".

178,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/02/artist-of-the-year-2021-for-film-animation-nolan-hieu-trifunovic/,"Trending: It’s daunting to imagine what Nolan Hieu Trifunovic might have done but for the pandemic. The senior at the Orange County School of the Arts had a pocketful of awards heading into 2020, including a dozen for his 10-minute narrative short film “Diamond Game.” What did Trifunovic do for an encore? Well, he made a music video as part of the national “Know Better,” campaign that called attention to unprovoked violence against Asian Americans. This was four months before the mass shooting in Atlanta that killed eight, including six women of Asian descent.  That topical and timely film, not to mention Trifunovic’s already impressive oeuvre of five shorts in 2018-2019, helped the 17-year-old grab Artist of the Year recognition in film/animation. In the music video, a masked Asian man is attacked unprovoked on a subway. “At the beginning of COVID, there was a lot of anti-Asian hatred,” said Trifonovic, who is Asian American, “but it wasn’t talked about.” Although never victimized by violence, Trifunovic was subjected to whispers and comments. Trifunovic collaborated with Milo Chang Sigel, who wrote an original song. Trifunovic’s film “Diamond Game,” which he describes as a “mashup between ‘Starsky and Hutch’” and “The Matrix,’” beat out more than 200 student films to win the Lizzie Award, the top prize at Westflix, a film competition hosted by Harvard-Westlake.  Trifunovic turned in the film to that competition in January, and learned about his award via Zoom. The inventive tale starts as a 1970s-style cop show, until it’s learned that the characters are controlled by three high school students who are writing their script on a computer. The action turns when a character starts to question his creators. Judges praised the passion, imagination and proficiency, with Anne Beatts of Chapman calling Trifunovic a “triple threat” in writing, directing and cinematography. How did the young filmmaker from Northridge, who no longer had to commute for hours via train to school in Orange County, spend his free time? Trifunovic, who plans to attend community college before majoring in film at a university, said he did a lot of writing and saw “movies that have been on my watch list forever.” Film/Animation is divided into three specialties: animation and visual effects, cinematography, and directing and editing. Artist of the Year Nolan Hieu Trifunovic won the directing and editing category. The other finalists are: Animation and visual effects: Ethan Kozik, Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts Described by his teacher, Michael Simmons, as an “in-house VFX genius,” Kozik, a senior at Huntington Beach Academy for the Performing Arts, submitted “Woodland Critters” in winning the animation and visual effects specialty. The western/horror film with a nice animated monster was a collaboration with his older brother, Max. Kozik said the film was notable because he actually finished it, rather than becoming overwhelmed with trying to perfect it and scrapping the film. Kozik will attend Cal State Long Beach and looks forward to creating virtual reality gaming where he says he has ideas that “have never been done before.” Cinematography: Yinzhi Pan, Portola High School Pan, a senior at Portola High, turned in stories with strong social messages in becoming the cinematography Artist of the Year. In the documentary “Nanmen: A Shanghai Story,” Pan tells of a family-owned, inner-city, roast duck restaurant in his hometown of Shanghai that faces imminent destruction from encroaching modernization and development. “Nanmen” won awards for Best Documentary and Best Cinematography at the Orange County Film Festival. Pan also created “Bloom,” a PSA about mental health for the nonprofit Each Mind Matters.  Get the latest news delivered daily!

179,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/02/gun-control-wont-address-the-root-of-gun-violence/,"Trending: Growing up in rural South Carolina on my family’s farm, I developed a love, appreciation and, most importantly, a respect for firearms. To this day, I remain a collector of firearms and a supporter of the American right to keep and bear arms as enshrined in the Second Amendment. I was taught that safety is paramount to gun ownership, so I have always encouraged responsible gun ownership and use for all Americans. With that being said, I have noticed a disturbing trend in our country: an ever-increasing number of shootings and gun-related deaths. And while the quick response from some, namely the left-wing mainstream media and liberal politicians, is to ban weapons and become more restrictive, it appears to me that we have serious mental health and poverty issues contributing to gun violence. I don’t believe that banning guns will result in any significant decline in shootings attributed to these two categories. In the United States, since January 2021, we have had 195 mass shootings, with 245 people dying and approximately 731 wounded, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. While it’s important to acknowledge that there is not a universally accepted definition of what constitutes a “mass shooting,” these numbers are staggering. They are some of the highest numbers in the industrialized world. Let’s contrast 2021 with when I was growing up, when mass shootings simply weren’t a problem. I believe that this is the direct result of the era and the family structure: Parents were involved in their children’s lives and children were taught discipline and respect. By and large, members of my generation were raised in households with two parents, and we were taught how to deescalate and talk things out when problems arose. Today, that no longer seems to be the case. We have a moral and social failing in our country that has caused an increase in mass shooters, predominantly young men. One has to pause to think about what’s different today from 30 or 40 years ago. It certainly isn’t guns, because it’s harder to get guns today than it was in the past, when you didn’t have to go through nationalized background checks. When I was growing up, you could purchase a firearm with no questions asked, yet we didn’t see so many mass shootings. America’s young men are struggling with mental health issues or are broken and living in poverty with single mothers struggling to survive. Many of them are clearly crying out for help, and we owe it to them to listen. Mental illness in this country has been stigmatized for far too long, so much so that many families are unwilling to confront their own past with it and certainly aren’t willing to acknowledge what their children may be experiencing. But even the families that recognize mental health issues might not have the resources or the know-how to get the proper help. This could all be changed at the federal level through more funding for treatment of mental illness. We also need program funding at the state and local level to assist schools with recognizing these signs early so that necessary steps can be taken to mitigate potential violence. Another important facet of this dialogue is religion. I know we don’t often talk about religion these days, but it instills moral and ethical values that are key to a society’s success. It creates boundaries that inform us of what is good and what is bad. Many of the greatest thinkers known to man have talked about the importance of morality and ethics for all civilized people, how they are key to a good life and setting boundaries against bad behavior. We often hear or read arguments from the left about inner cities, such as Baltimore or Chicago, being examples of violence run amuck that highlight the need for more gun control. However, proponents of these measures don’t always want to deal with poverty, family breakdown, education or economic opportunities. When people are better educated, financially secure and are happy with their family life and their community outlook, they are more likely to be constructive members of society and less likely to go down a dangerous path. Today, there is clearly a lack of pride, security, belonging and ownership that is so fundamental to continued success of any society. If we start focusing on those things and truly tackle them without making excuses or trying to blame everything on the system, I am confident that we may actually be able to solve the root of the problem. We can acknowledge that we have a problem in our country with gun-related deaths and the young men who typically carry out such heinous acts. But with that discussion comes the responsibility to take a nuanced approach to finding the root of the problem. I can assure you that simply banning guns won’t solve this multifaceted problem.

181,https://www.alternet.org/2021/05/nras-wayne-lapierre/,"The last couple of years at the National Rifle Association have been filled with lawsuits, firings, resignations, and accusations of gross mismanagement of membership money by the top executives of the nonprofit. The NRA filed for bankruptcy in January, in part to get out from under investigations into its dealings by the New York attorney general's office. In the middle of the back-and-forth lawsuits between the NRA and its former piggy bank (and public relations consulting partner) Ackerman McQueen, the pro-Second Amendment organization was hit with another lawsuit from the producers of a show claiming they were left in the lurch after the NRA closed down its NRATV channel in 2019. Producers on a long-running program called Under Wild Skies alleged the NRA had not fully paid them for all of the shows that were produced for the gun group. This is not the the most unique example of scumbaggery heard of in the entertainment business. However, the NRA's lawyers argued that the show's producers were asking for payment on two episodes that were not completed. Under Wild Skies LLC's attorneys said that their clients had indeed completed those shows but that they were ""not released at the sole direction of Wayne LaPierre."" It took about eight years but The Trace and The New Yorker have gotten their hands on the footage that was buried. It is somehow worse than expected. There has been a lot of speculation as to what footage was contained in these shows that would lead Wayne LaPierre to scuttle the episodes. What was known was that the shows starred Wayne LaPierre and his wife Susan hunting down, killing, and gloating over the largest land mammals on Earth—African bush elephants. What was also known was that the LaPierres went to go hunt these elephants about one year after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. But simply hunting big game animals has never seemed to be something the NRA considered bad public relations. The NRA and MAGA Republicans across the country have made it very clear that their opinions on what the Second Amendment of our Constitution is takes precedent over the shooting of school children. Shooting elephants in a faraway land is unlikely to register for people like the LaPierres. Still, there was speculation that at least part of the reason for this revision of hunting history had to do with Wayne LaPierre's media kit boasting to membership: It looks like the skilled hunter bit might be what was hurting Wayne's teeny-tiny soul. The footage was shot in Botswana. Wayne LaPierre is guided to a spot from where he can shoot an elephant. LaPierre is unable to hear the guide telling him to wait, as he is wearing earplugs to protect his ears from the sound, and shoots the elephant. Unfortunately, Wayne LaPierre isn't good at hunting things, it seems, and the elephant is not dead, just immobilized on the ground. LaPierre is directed to shoot the still-breathing animal while it lies on the ground. The guide points to where he wants LaPierre to shoot. From just a few feet away, LaPierre takes two shots at the poor animal, and while hitting the animal, still does not kill him. The guide says to LaPierre, ""I'm not sure where you're shooting."" LaPierre seems frustrated, asking where he is supposed to shoot the animal. The guide even asks LaPierre's travel buddy Tony Makris, a C-suite executive at the NRA's former PR firm Ackerman McQueen, if he wants to finish off the poor animal for LaPierre. LaPierre says he can do it, and from point-blank range, shoots the elephant for a fourth time. He misses the mark. Makris finally steps in and takes the kill shot, and like the PR dirtbag he is, turns to LaPierre and says ""You dropped him like no tomorrow."" Susan LaPierre's section of the video shows her to be a better shot and better listener than her husband. Her experience culminates with her cutting off the tail of the fallen elephant she killed. Unlike her husband, Susan seems genuinely enthused and emotional and grateful for the experience itself. I'm not a hunting person, and outside of the need for hunting to balance eco systems or for food, I find it an archaic pursuit. That being said, as little as I like people like Susan and Wayne LaPierre, at least Susan seems to really want to murder things for some perverse sense of accomplishment. But Wayne … I just don't know what he's doing with his cold, dead hands. Makris was a producer on the show, which originally aired on NBC. The show was canceled by NBC in 2013 after Makris shot an elephant in 2012 and said his critics are ""like Hitler."" NRATV took on the show, which was why this expensive little jaunt took place. According to The Trace, elephant hunting in Botswana costs tens of thousands of dollars and while the footage never aired on the show, Susan made sure to get her trophies sent secretly to her and Wayne: ""The Master Airway Bill was in the name of a taxidermist, whom Makris's company paid to turn the animals' front feet into stools for Wayne and Susan's home.""

""As it happens in the Oneida Nation community, we treat our community like family. As this happens on our reservation we treat the situation like family, like it happened to us. We send those heartfelt condolences to those affected as well as those who had to be on-site,"" said tribal Vice Chairman Brandon Stevens during a news conference Sunday evening. The incident began about 7:30 p.m. Saturday when officers responded to reports of shots fired at the Duck Creek Kitchen + Bar inside the Radisson, which is attached to the Oneida Casino, the Brown County Sheriff's Office said. Police killed the gunman outside the facility after he had shot three other people in or near the restaurant, Lt. Kevin Pawlak said at a news conference just after midnight. The gunman went to the restaurant in search of a specific employee, but the worker he targeted was not there, Pawlak said. The man then shot other workers, two of whom died, the sheriff's office said. The other injured victim was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee for emergency surgery. No information has been made available about that person's condition. Police said they believed the gunman had been employed at the Oneida Casino and had a dispute with the person he meant to target. Pawlak on Saturday night said the motive and the relationship between the shooter and the victims remained unclear. Police swarmed the scene soon after a 911 caller reported shots fired, arriving from every law enforcement agency in Brown County as well as several from neighboring counties. Tribal leadership expressed appreciation for the response. Louise Cornelius, the tribe's gaming general manager, on Sunday commended security and staff for the quick and effective evacuation of the building and for following the hotel and casino's safety protocols. ""Safety and security of our staff and guests has always been our top priority,"" she said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. ""That commitment was evident with our staff last night."" RELATED: What we know about the Oneida Casino shooting that left three dead, one seriously injured RELATED: 'Distressed' and 'in disbelief,' tribal leaders, Gov. Tony Evers, others speak out about Oneida Casino shooting RELATED: Man injured in shooting near Oneida Casino recovering after 'jaw wired shut' in surgery, sister says The Oneida Nation doesn't allow firearms on any of its properties. Tribal leaders will review the active shooting training and security protocols they have in place at their properties to look for ways they might be improved. ""Some things such as this are pretty hard to stop, but it's making sure we have the proper response to any type of emergency situation,"" Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill said on Sunday. The Brown County Sheriff's Office and Oneida Police Department are investigating the homicides, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation is reviewing the death of the gunman because it involved police officers. Authorities had not identified the shooter or the victims as of Sunday evening. Police are still looking for people who witnessed the shootings. Anyone who hasn't spoken to an officer is asked to call Brown County Lt. Brian Slinger at 920-448-4229. Groups in town for various events were staying at the Radisson, said Brad Toll, president and CEO of the Greater Green Bay Convention and Visitors Bureau. Staff from the bureau worked with other hotels in the area and police to find new places for them to stay, an effort that took until after 2 a.m. “It was our goal to support the Radisson in any way we could,” Toll said. “The great thing about our lodging community: Whenever there’s a need, we forget brands in Green Bay and make sure we take care of everyone.” Two buses from Green Bay Metro Transit arrived at the scene after 10 p.m. and spent the next five hours shuttling about 250 people to other locations at the direction of public safety officers, transit director Patty Kiewiz said. The buses proved helpful, she said, because several people who needed transportation required wheelchairs. ""In these types of situations, I truly do offer our service unconditionally. Whatever they need, (law enforcement officers) have the authority to have our operators do what they need in those situations,"" Kiewiz said. ""It’s what we’re there for: to assist in whatever means we can."" Patrick, a Massachusetts resident who declined to provide his last name, was among the hotel guests still on the Radisson grounds Sunday. He said he and a group of other men were in Duck Creek Kitchen + Bar when they heard a loud pop that they initially thought was a balloon bursting, since there was a wedding reception and several hockey teams also were gathered there. They then heard a second pop and saw the gunman. “It’s one of those &mldr surreal moments,” Patrick said. “It’s one of those things where you see a lot of 'First 48' crime shows, but you never thought you’d be a part of it. It happened here and it was just unfortunate that we was a part of that.” Robert Hesson said he was attending a friend's birthday party in a banquet room at the casino when staff rushed in and screamed at them to get out. Outside, staff told them to get farther and farther from the building as police rushed in with tactical weapons and shotguns. Hesson said that's when he first heard a couple of gunshots, then a large number. People told them to get behind cars and get down. ""I know no place is immune to this, but now it's hit home,"" Hesson said. ""It's sad and it's disgusting, all at the same time."" Cornelius, the gaming general manager, said 150 to 200 employees were on the property at the time. Employee assistance program services and counselors will be available for at least for the next two weeks and as long as employees need them, she said. Appointments won't be needed to talk to a counselor. Max Westphal of Brownsville said he was playing blackjack with a group of friends when an announcement came over a loudspeaker that people should evacuate. At first, he said, they thought it was something minor. Once outside they heard the situation quickly escalate. ""All of a sudden, a huge flurry of gunshots. Between 10 and 30 gunshots,"" Westphal said. ""All you could smell outside was gunpowder."" He and his friends took off running to get farther away from the scene, he said. Taylor Schroeder was at the bingo hall in a separate building and didn't hear shots, but players were put on lockdown around 8 p.m. and given no information about what was happening, he said. They kept playing bingo and received occasional ""vague"" updates until about 45 minutes later, when they were made to leave immediately. Outside, fire trucks, ambulances and police vehicles were ""everywhere."" ""I'm just glad we were able to evacuate so effectively and quickly,"" Schroeder said.

183,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/05/02/asian-americans-generational-split-racism/,"Trending: ATLANTA — The fatal shootings of eight people — six of them women of Asian descent — at Georgia massage businesses in March propelled Claire Xu into action. Within days, she helped organize a rally condemning violence against Asian Americans that drew support from a broad group of activists, elected officials and community members. But her parents objected. “’We don’t want you to do this,’” Xu, 31, recalled their telling her afterward. “‘You can write about stuff, but don’t get your face out there.’” The shootings and other recent attacks on Asian Americans have exposed a generational divide in the community. Many young activists say their parents and other elders are saddened by the violence but question the value of protests or worry about their consequences. They’ve also found the older generations tend to identify more closely with their ethnic groups — Chinese or Vietnamese, for example — and appear reluctant to acknowledge racism. That divide makes it harder to forge a collective Asian American constituency that can wield political power and draw attention to the wave of assaults against people of Asian descent in the U.S. since the coronavirus pandemic began, community leaders say. “In our original countries, where our ancestors came from, they wouldn’t even imagine that someone from Bangladesh would be lumped in the same group as someone from Laos,” said Angela Hsu, president of the Georgia Asian Pacific American Bar Association. But those differences obscure a shared experience of “feeling like we’re constantly thought of as being foreign in our own country,” said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, of New Jersey. Much of the recent violence against Asian Americans has targeted the elderly, and some seniors have attended rallies to condemn it. But Cora McDonnell, 79, said she did not want to speak out, though she is now scared to walk to the church blocks from her Seattle home. She emigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines in 1985 and said her culture was “more respectful.” “You talk maybe in your family, but not really publicly,” she said. “You don’t really blurt out things.” Lani Wong, 73, said she understood that feeling, though she does not adhere to it. “Just don’t stir the pot, don’t get involved,” said Wong, chairwoman of the National Association of Chinese Americans. “I think that was the mentality of the older generation.” Some young Asian Americans said they were frustrated by family members’ reactions to the shootings. E. Lim said it was “infuriating and really sad” to hear her parents cast aspersions on the massage work done by some of the Georgia shooting victims. “It’s almost like this desperation for denial so that they don’t have to recognize that there is a world that hates them,” said Lim, organizing and civic engagement director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta. A pastor in the Atlanta area, Tae Chin, said his Korean mother-in-law also questioned the victims’ line of work while urging him not to focus on race. Four of the slain women were of Korean descent. “‘Just work hard. Just live. Just be a good person, and they’ll see someday,’” Chin, 41, recalled her saying on a phone call after the March 16 attack. “I’m like, ‘That’s why we have this problem to begin with, because that’s exactly what we do.’” Allison Wang’s parents were similarly inclined and thought she was wasting her time protesting the shootings. “I think they believe that it’s more important to focus on your career and family and don’t really feel like we can make a difference,” said Wang, who helped Xu put together the rally in downtown Atlanta. For Raymond Tran’s family, the political history of one of their home countries played a role in opposing his involvement in any organizations. The attorney raised in Los Angeles said that when he was growing up, his parents told him about an uncle imprisoned and tortured by Vietnamese communists after joining a student group. Racist polices in the U.S. strictly limited immigrants from Asia until the 1960s, so many Asian families have been in the country for only a generation or two. It’s not unusual for new immigrants to focus on providing for their families, avoiding attention in favor of assimilation. Asian immigrants face the added burden of the “model minority” stereotype that portrays them as industrious, law-abiding and uncomplaining, and ascribes their achievements to those traits, historians and advocates say. “It divides generations,” said Maki Hsieh, CEO of the Asian Hall of Fame, a program that honors Asian leaders. “It divides Asians from each other, and ultimately it divides them from other groups.” Xu said her parents worried about her safety, but she thinks their objections to her activism also stemmed in part from a desire to avoid trouble. They understood the need to speak out against anti-Asian violence but didn’t want her to do it, she said. “I wholeheartedly believe if this is the way everybody thinks, then there won’t be any progress,” she said. The younger generation is also coming of age during a period of renewed racial awareness — reflected in last year’s Black Lives Matter protests — that makes it impossible for Asians in the U.S. to “fly under the racial radar anymore,” said Nitasha Tamar Sharma, director of the Asian American Studies program at Northwestern University. In addition to holding rallies and vigils across the country in the wake of the Georgia shootings, young organizers have shared stories of racist encounters and used the hashtag #StopAsianHate to raise awareness about the dangers Asian Americans face. “In America, we are all one,” said Hsu, the bar association president. “We are viewed in a similar way.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2021-05-02 18:35:24,Asian Americans see generational split on confronting racism,,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking
184,https://dailycaller.com/2021/05/02/philadelphia-fraternal-order-police-ice-cream-district-attorney-larry-krasner/,"Screenshot via Facebook/John McNesby A Philadelphia police union offered free ice cream on Friday outside the office of District Attorney Larry Krasner to protest “soft on crime” policies. The Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 will pay for a Mr. Softee’s ice cream truck to give out free ice cream outside of Krasner’s office every Friday until the May 18 Democratic primary for District Attorney, Fox 29 Philadelphia reported. FOP has endorsed Krasner’s challenger, Carlos Vega. “We figured we would go out and bring an ice cream truck—a Mister Softee truck out—because we have Mr. Softee in the DA’s office. Soft on crime, soft on sentencing. Too many shootings. We got six people a day average being shot in Philadelphia. That’s ridiculous,” FOP Lodge 5 President John McNesby told Fox 29. “Larry Krasner has a broad coalition of support from over 60 endorsers who represent constituencies from all over this city. They speak for the community, not the powerful and we’re proud that today they are out working to better Philadelphia rather than serving ice cream and spending money on publicity stunts,” Krasner’s campaign responded. Krasner has repeatedly clashed with the Philadelphia police union. A former public defender, he was elected in 2018 after promising to stop seeking the death penalty, end stop-and-frisk, and limit drug prosecutions. (RELATED: George Soros Still Quietly Buying District Attorneys’ Seats) Philadelphia has struggled to attract new police officers amid a spike in murders. McNesby blamed a decrease in applicants on the coronavirus pandemic as well as new department regulations. The same day as a mass shooting outside of a North Philadelphia train station, Krasner reportedly downplayed the issue of violent crime at a campaign event. “Screams, ranting and raving, ‘There will be a crime wave; there will be werewolves running up and down the street; they’re gonna grab you people out of your house and take them out of the back!'” Krasner reportedly said. “Except no, that’s not what happened.” “He doesn’t care about anybody but himself. He’s a condescending person, he’s arrogant,” McNesby responded at the time.

They’ll just get more pissed off. And lone actors will be back. One would think the charging of some 440 Capitol marauders would defang right-wing extremists. Likewise, their de-platforming on social media and the exit of the president who inspired them. Likewise, the splintering of groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, whose members have been rounded up by authorities for storming the citadel. Nope. That won’t stop them. Experts who monitor domestic terrorism say we’re heading into an even more dangerous phase post-Jan.6. These groups are fragmenting and losing the ability to vent frustration in a public manner. But that does not mean they are going away. It means that a lot of angry radicals are growing angrier. “You will see a period of growth,” says Daryl Johnson, the former lead analyst for domestic terrorism for the Department of Homeland Security. “The people on the outside periphery will likely distance themselves and get out of the movement. But the pool inside is going to be more hardcore and resolved.” He predicts more violence during the rest of President Joe Biden’s term. And maybe for many more years after that. While we’re unlikely to see a mass event like Jan. 6 that brought together 10,000 people at the Capitol, there could be more local attacks on a smaller but maybe more lethal scale—car rammings, assassination plots, and bombings of state government buildings, infrastructure, or places where ordinary folks gather. For sure, some of the core 1,000 who breached the Capitol are spooked by the legal consequences. But a sense of glory surrounding the insurrection and resentment will animate the more committed militants. While they’ve lost their megaphone in Trump, other politicians amplify his message in the mainstream political discourse. And more fodder exists for recruitment among right-wingers fearful of anti-gun legislation and the expansion of minority rights under a Democratic president. The stressors of the pandemic remain. People are socially estranged, under financial stress, and fearful of change. Gun sales have exploded since Jan. 6. Shutting down accounts on Twitter, Facebook, or Parler doesn’t shut up extremists. They simply migrate to other spaces like the Telegram messaging system. Conversations are still happening among extremists who encourage each other to make trouble. No one knows for sure how many combustible individuals lurk about, but militias number in the hundreds across the country. Johnson estimates there could be as many as 145,000 active members of anti-government groups including the Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, Boogaloo Boys, and Proud Boys. Add to that hundreds of thousands of white supremacists and millions of QAnon believers. You just need a handful of guys willing to get into risky situations, like the six militia members charged last year with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And there are certainly a lot of guns circulating with which to create trouble. For the second year running, firearms sales have hit record numbers so far this year. According to the FBI, March 15-21 alone posted the highest number of weekly background checks—more than 1.2 million—since 1998. Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, worries most about individuals with violent tendencies who aren’t necessarily card-carrying members of a paramilitary. Sometimes a cluster is just a couple of buddies who meet in someone’s basement. Of the first 257 people charged in federal court for taking part in the Capitol insurrection, only 33 percent were identified with a militant network, according to a study by the George Washington University Program on Extremism. That means the vast majority were unaffiliated but motivated by the pro-Trump narrative. “The less organized they are, the more dangerous they are,” Segal says. The FBI can more easily infiltrate an organization like the Oath Keepers, which draws members from the military and law enforcement. But with groups like the Proud Boys splintering, rogue members are harder to monitor. Networks that break up can realign under so many different names that it’s impossible to keep track. Then there are the lone actors. They could be socially isolated but very much part of a wider ideological community that exists online. Some of the most violent events we’ve seen in recent years were perpetrated by self-radicalized gunmen who operated on their own. They didn’t belong to a given group. The shooter who killed 23 people at an El Paso Walmart in 2019. The gunman who slaughtered 11 people at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue the year before. Dylann Roof, who fatally shot nine African Americans at a Charleston church in 2015. These individuals may act alone but think they have people behind them, notes Arie Kruglanski, a University of Maryland professor of psychology who studies radicalization. Mass shooters know they will be remembered. Their “community” can be assumed or imagined. The white supremacist who killed 70 people in Norway in 2011, for instance, believed he was a protector of the race, even if he didn’t consult anyone else. “The lone wolf is not as lonely as it appears,” Kruglanski warns. Last year saw a notable absence of mass killings, probably as a function of the pandemic. The opening of public spaces, however, has coincided with at least 147 mass shooting incidents that have killed 166 so far this year. We are likely to experience even more mass slaughter that is politically motivated, predicts Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino. We may also see a diversification of targets from minority groups to political figures, reporters, and public health officials. Extremists have many grievances—land use, guns, COVID restrictions, unemployment, loss of status. They may confuse or conflate different issues as they chat with others online. “You have highly volatile people who can be picked up by a variety of conspiracies and movements with violent leanings,” Levin says. “That’s a big reservoir to swim in.” Geographic data on arrests so far could provide clues into where trouble might flare next. A study by the Chicago Project on Security and Threats found that over half of the Capitol rioters who converged from 42 states came from counties that President Joe Biden won. This smashes the common assumption that the Trump fans who resort to violence would mainly hail from his strongholds. In fact, more came from cities and suburbs where they were in the political minority, and thus probably felt marginalized. The largest numbers came from Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, and California—all places with racial diversity. These numbers coincide with geographic trends in hate crimes and racist violence examined by Arie Perliger, the director of Security Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. The same blue states crop up in attacks on minorities or synagogues. Perliger says most incidents before Jan. 6 occurred not in the deep red South but in rural and suburban areas of blue states that have the highest levels of diversity. New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, California, and even Massachusetts. Spot the pattern here? Of the more than 650 violent incidents between 1990 and 2017, Tennessee suffered just 80. California had more than 900 incidents and Illinois over 200. “In these kinds of states, the polarization and animosity are more toxic,” explains Perliger. In Alabama there is little divide; it’s overwhelmingly conservative. But New York state poses more toxic potential due to the split between the blueish New York City and the reddish upstate. Anxiety about the economy also fuels xenophobia against growing Hispanic and Asian populations, which are viewed as competition in the labor market, he notes, Here’s what we need to look out for: states like Georgia that tipped blue, where there is change, demographically and politically. Is there a particular issue that makes right-wingers feel under siege? Is there a charismatic rabble rouser? Study where violent incidents occurred pre-Jan. 6. Last year, Trump supporters stormed state capitols in Oregon and Michigan. In response to lockdowns and restrictions, armed protests flared in Ohio, Kentucky, California, Arizona, and Virginia. These could be hot spots in the months ahead. Judith Matloff teaches conflict reporting at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism.

187,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/03/local-media-can-survive-the-canadian-team-building-a-future-for-community-news,"As local papers close their doors, a morning newsletter defied the odds. Now its founder aims to push the model nationwide First published on Mon 3 May 2021 11.10 BST Local journalism has shed jobs faster than the coal industry, leaving swaths of North America as news deserts with little or no regular coverage. But the grim prospects for an industry in decline didn’t deter the Canadian tech entrepreneur Andrew Wilkinson, who in 2019 hired a reporter and launched a daily newsletter in his home town, Victoria.  Emailed to subscribers early each morning, Capital Daily gave residents news highlights from around the city. Wilkinson bought advertising on Facebook and Google and subscribers started pouring in. A year later, the venture had more than 40,000 readers, and within two years, the Capital Daily has transformed from morning digest of the city’s news into an enterprising outlet publishing long-form investigative features. Now, building on the newsletter’s success, a startup media group has unveiled ambitious plans to replicate the model across the country. Overstory Media Group, which operates newsletter-based journalism outlets in British Columbia, including the Burnaby Beacon, Decomplicated and the Capital Daily, has announced plans to hire 250 new journalists and launch 50 new outlets by 2023. “I’ve always believed community media was always going to survive,” said chief executive Farhan Mohamed, who co-founded the venture with Wilkinson. “But it just has to be done in the right way.” The announcement comes at a difficult time for Canadian media, which has seen the same mass layoffs and newspaper closures as in the United States. In 2017, 36 community newspapers were shut down – the largest mass closure in Canadian history – and hundreds of reporters laid off after the country’s largest media companies, TorStar and PostMedia, announced a deal to trade 41 community newspapers with one another as a cost-saving measure. And despite government efforts, the coronavirus pandemic has brought more losses to the sector: in the past year, 52 community newspapers have closed. “You often hear that journalism is a calling, that people are willing to make less money to do something that they’re passionate about. That’s absolute nonsense. It’s a broken system,” said Mohamed. “There is so much talent that’s out there and it needs to be harnessed and given opportunity.” While Overstory plans to offer resources to each of the publications, Mohamed envisions the brands operating independently. Funded by Wilkinson as well as growing advertising revenues, the group’s current titles have shown they are sustainable and profitable, Mohamed says. The idea of expanding across the country reflects both the success of the current outlets and deeply underserved markets outside of the large urban centres, he said. Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal dominate much of the country’s focus, but residents of smaller towns and cities have an equally strong hunger for local news. “When we look at these communities, our goal is to be around for the next 30 or 40 years. We think in a generational sort of way,” he said. The Capital Daily, Overstory’s marquee brand, has quickly become one of Victoria’s most-read outlets. “Local journalism has this reputation as being stodgy, boring, low stakes. People think of it as covering the little league game and getting way too far into some dispute over a Walmart parking lot,” said its managing editor, Jimmy Thomson. “But local journalism has always been an incredibly important tool for keeping the people who make decisions that are the closest to us accountable.” Much of the daily news is handled by larger legacy outlets in Victoria, giving the Capital Daily the opportunity to tell stories from different angles. “We benefit greatly from the reporting that others do in the city,” he said. “But I hope our readers are getting something from us that they’re not getting from anyone else.” He points to a recent investigation into a famous hotel in the area that took the reporter nearly four months to complete and earned praise from reporters at larger outlets. The region is “incredibly lucky” to have the Capital Daily, tweeted Ian Young, Vancouver correspondent for the South China Morning Post. “It is very far from your typical ‘local’ journalism, which is not at all a slight on typical local journalists.” While other legacy newspapers struggle to maintain circulation numbers, media startups like the Capital Daily don’t have a physical office space, nor do they have to worry about printing a physical newspaper. Overstory’s expansion is the most ambitious in the country, but it isn’t alone in trying to reimagine local news. In 2014, the investigative journalist Tim Bousquet founded the Halifax Examiner, which has since scaled up into a full-fledged news outlet. During a mass shooting in the province last year last year, the Examiner’s reporting into the police response won praise from outlets with far more resources. Indiegraf works to give enterprising journalists the tools needed to start a digital publication that serves community readership. While a number of journalism startups have found success in recent years by targeting a national market, including the Narwhal, Canadaland (which has also received funding from Tiny Foundation) and the Logic, Overstory’s bet is that communities are hungry for locally focused stories. “People care about what’s happening around them, not just what’s happening on the other side of the country,” said Mohamed. “So why aren’t we spending enough time talking about that?” Many have tried. Since 2008, 165 new local news outlets have launched in 120 communities across the country, according to recent data from the Local News Project. But over that same period, a total of 448 news operations have closed in 323 communities, most of which were local newspapers. Despite the initial success, Thomson says the venture is still very much an experiment. “A lot of people are trying different ways of doing journalism in Canada. We’re just one of them. I don’t know if we’re right,” he said. “I hope we are. I hope we’re solving a problem within journalism and that we can make this all work. But ultimately, we don’t know yet.”",2021-05-03 06:10:00,‘Local media can survive’: the Canadian team building a future for community news,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Any visitor to Rock Hill, South Carolina, soon learns that ""Football City, USA"" basks in the glory of the dozens of youth leaguers who have gone on to win college championships and land coveted NFL contracts. Competitive football is so essential to the city of 75,000 that a longtime high school coach can’t even pause to watch a nearby middle school game, lest he be accused of recruiting. But in the aftermath of a mass shooting by a popular homegrown player whose family blamed football for his troubles, some parents and coaches are facing tough questions about the role the sport plays in children's lives. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Phillip Adams, whose NFL career is still celebrated on the county tourism website, is accused of killing Dr. Robert Lesslie, his wife, their two grandchildren and two air conditioning technicians at the doctor's home before killing himself last month. Investigators haven't said what might have prompted the deadly attack. His father, Alonzo Adams, told WCNC-TV that ""he was a good kid, and I think the football messed him up."" And his sister, Lauren Adams, told USA Today that her brother’s ""mental health degraded fast and terribly bad"" in recent years, leaving him with ""extremely concerning"" signs of mental illness, including an escalating temper. People who knew the Rock Hill High graduate as a kind and mild-mannered young man are wondering if head injuries he suffered as a player affected his mental health. A probe of his brain was ordered to see whether he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a possibly degenerative disease that has been shown to cause violent mood swings and other cognitive disorders in some athletes. Adams, 32, played in 78 NFL games over six seasons for six teams — San Francisco, New England, Seattle, Oakland and the New York Jets before retiring with Atlanta in 2015. He suffered a severe ankle injury as a rookie with the 49ers, and was recorded as having two concussions with the Raiders. There may never be a definitive link between his concussions and the act of deadly violence this month. But in the aftermath, some leaders in the city’s football community are reflecting on how to frame what happened to the many young players still in the game. Rock Hill is renowned for bringing up aspiring players through small fry teams and catapulting them into the pros. At least 37 athletes from the city’s three public high schools have played in the NFL, according to a list maintained by one of the coaches that goes back to the 50s. Current pros include New England Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore and No. 1 overall draft pick Jadeveon Clowney, who signed with the Cleveland Browns this offseason. But awareness is growing nationwide among parents, players and spectators about the potentially lasting impacts of sports concussions, and that includes Rock Hill. Ed Paat, who runs a nonprofit in town, played football as a kid decades ago. Now 42, he and his wife are steering their four kids toward other sports, like gymnastics and jiu jitsu, in light of the emerging research and events including the shooting. ""For our family, it’s not something that’s an option,"" Paat said. ""The more we learn about CTE, brain injuries, traumatic brain injuries -- for us there are just other avenues for athletics that don’t have such a potential for long term medical effects."" Paat acknowledges his view is probably unpopular in the town: ""The mindset my wife and I have, I would assume is a minority in the South, not only in the South but in Rock Hill,"" Paat said. David Sweem, a former athletic trainer and football coach who now serves on South Carolina's Brain Injury Safety Net Task Force, said he's noticed that parents are definitely more aware of football's head injury risks. ""It's made me rethink some things with my own children. And I love football. Still very passionate about the sport,"" he said. Children, too, are taking notice. Ronnie Collins, an accountant, said he’s trying to get his son interested in playing, but 12-year-old Jackson is worried about getting injured after learning about concussions and watching players get hurt on television. Some youth coaches in town object to seeing football singled out for safety reasons when other contact sports also face inherent physical risks. Perry Sutton, who’s coached youth football for three decades, said his 7-year-old grandson's soccer games are rough: ""Them kids kicking each other in the head and everything. You don’t get that in football."" Still, Rock Hill's youth programs have responded by putting coaches through hours of concussion training each year and teaching kids to tackle with their bodies, not their heads. And while participation rates for youth and high school sports have dropped nationally, most coaches interviewed here said the number of kids playing football in Rock Hill remains about the same. Lawrence Brown, a youth coach who grew up with Adams and played on the same small fry team, said the killings changed his perspective. He's been thinking lately about emphasizing that players need to live their lives outside the game, too. ""We know we can’t play football forever. We know we can't play any sport forever,"" Brown said. Growing up alongside future football stars has been exciting for Kia Wright, but now she's worried for her own 12-year-old son Kaleb. She wants him to play baseball, but her son’s passion for football outshines any other sport. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She said Kaleb heard about the shooting on the news, but wouldn't talk about it, probably fearing she'd pull him out of football if he did.

195,https://hotair.com/jazz-shaw/2021/05/03/old-and-busted-gun-control-new-hotness-ammo-control-n387452,"Aside from a couple of executive orders, Joe Biden’s plans to pass major gun control legislation such as the confiscation of scary-looking rifles seems to be going nowhere fast at the moment. There might be something on background checks in the works, but that seems to be about it. But that doesn’t mean that gun-grabbing enthusiasts around the various states aren’t still hatching plans. As our Bearing Arms colleague Tom Knighton points out this week, there is a movement afoot in Flordia to introduce “ammo control” legislation. One idea is to impose a massive tax on ammunition, as per an old Chris Rock comedy routine that Tom flashes back to. Another scheme would require background checks for the purchase of ammunition. The bill is named after Jaime Guttenberg, who was killed during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But as Knighton points out, none of the measures under discussion would have impacted that event and would be unlikely to act as a deterrent to future criminals. Of course, the idea here is that ammo control will somehow stop violent crime. What’s not mentioned is how Guttenberg’s daughter was killed by a guy who passed his background check because the sheriff’s office didn’t bother to arrest him on the plethora of domestic violence calls they responded to. He would have passed a background check for ammo as well. Nor is there any acknowledgment that if you try to regulate ammo, criminals will just find a different source for it. Either they’ll get straw buyers–which will be even easier to pull off since ammo isn’t serialized and it’s consumable anyway–to obtain it for them. That’s all true. The sale of ammunition is controlled, but the individual rounds are not serialized or even very easy to track once removed from the packaging. Tracking an actual firearm is at least somewhat more manageable. Also, demanding background checks doesn’t do anything to impede either the people who are able to pass them (such as the maniacal Parkland shooter) or the career criminals who are responsible for the vast majority of shootings and buy their hardware on the black or gray markets. Placing a massive tax on ammunition may slow down the illegal sale of ammunition if straw purchasers have to pass on the cost of the tax, but you’re primarily hitting the wallets of legal, law-abiding gun owners more than anything else. The same rule applies to further restrictions on the legal purchase of the firearms themselves. Of course, I get the sense that for far too many liberals pushing these gun-grabbing activities, having a negative impact on law-abiding gun owners probably isn’t seen as a negative. In fact, for at least some of them, that’s probably more of a feature than a bug. They’ve been steeped in these Second Amendment battles for so long that anyone who supports gun rights is perceived as being automatically a conservative and therefore “the enemy.” It’s a classic case of “owning the cons” (as opposed to “owning the libs”). Even if all of their most cherished gun control measures were passed into law and crime didn’t decrease one bit they would still be satisfied with a job well done. But just in case, as we say every time a Democrat is elected, you might want to consider going out and stocking up on ammunition as a precaution. And based on the sales figures being reported by gun shops around the country, plenty of you are doing just that already. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

The Brown County Sheriff's Office on Monday said Bruce Pofahl opened fire at his former workplace, the Duck Creek Kitchen and Bar at the Radisson Hotel & Convention Center in Green Bay, where he shot and killed employees Ian Simpson, 32, and Jacob Bartel, 35 on Saturday.
Advertisement Daniel L. Mulligan, 28, was shot outside the building but survived and is in serious but stable condition. Sheriff Todd Delain said Pofahl, 62, had been fired from his job as the restaurant's food and beverage manager earlier this year and was told he was no longer allowed on the property.
RELATED 1 dead, several injured in two New Orleans shootings Pofahl entered the restaurant with a 9mm handgun and walked to the waiter station where he shot and killed Simpson and Bartel and then left the building and shot Mulligan, Delain said. Law enforcement shot and killed Pofahl near the first-floor parking ramp on the east side of the casino complex. In total the attack lasted about 10 minutes. Three Green Bay officers have been placed on administrative leave but Delain on Monday said they were justified in their decision to fire.
RELATED Georgia police capture fugitive who escaped custody at airport ""Certainly this individual was a threat,"" he said at a news briefing. Authorities did not provide a motive on Monday but Brown County Lt. Kevin Pawlak told reporters Saturday that he was ""targeting a specific victim who was not there."" Online court records showed that Pofahl's supervisor, Elizabeth Walker, had taken out a restraining order against him in March saying he had been fired for ""a few things, including harassment"" and had been sending her threatening texts and emails for several weeks.

Sen. Jen Kiggan's (R) is making a run for the seat currently being held by Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA) and recently sent out an email in the hopes of bolstering her campaign against the incumbent lawmaker.

Crews had to flee the fire lines late Thursday after a dangerous ""fire cloud"" started to collapse, threatening them with strong downdrafts and flying embers. An initial review Friday showed the Bootleg Fire destroyed 67 homes and 117 outbuildings overnight in one county. Authorities were still counting the losses in a second county where the flames are surging up to 4 miles (6 kilometers) a day.                Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Our month started on a sad note when a gunman locked himself inside an office building in Orange killing four people. The shooting happened on the last day of March, but its repercussions were felt far into April. Among those killed were Louis Tovar’s father, sister and brother. His mother, shot three times — twice in the head — is recovering. Entertainment started coming back to the county as 400 people gather at the Segerstrom Center for its first indoor performance in 13 months. The West Coast premiere of “Indestructible Light,” choreographed by Darrell Grand Moultrie, for the American Ballet Theatre’s production of “Uniting in Movement”. The 18-member corps of American Ballet Theatre dancers performed for the small live audiences and were filmed for ballet program, called “United in Movement,” which will be available for digital viewing May 12-26. The rally monkey appeared as Mike Trout helped the Angels defeat the White Sox in front of 13,207 fans on Opening Day, exactly 550 days since the last time fans were allowed at The Big A. Angel Stadium can seat over 45,500 people, but COVID-19 restrictions kept the stadium at 33% capacity. And, after 412 days, the county’s most famous business welcomed visitors again – Disneyland reopened. Tears were flowing as visitors walked down Main Street U.S.A. at 8 a.m. to the familiar announcement of “Hello and welcome to Disneyland.” Disney fans returned to a rethemed Snow White’s Enchanted Wish, updated Haunted Mansion and refreshed King Arthur Carrousel to the delight of die-hard fans who waited hours to snag tickets for the reopening of the Anaheim theme park. The Register photo staff ended the month on a personal note as we said goodbye to long-time photographer Bill Alkofer. He headed back east with his sister after dealing with the symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, for two and half years. It is always fatal, with a 2-to-5 year life expectancy. Fellow Register photojournalist Mindy Shauer photographed and wrote a moving story about Alkofer’s life and his struggles with the disease as it is slowly taking over his body and robbing him of his independence. You can read it here. Enjoy the pictures and follow The Orange County Register on Facebook and Instagram.

Bill Alkofer goes through thousands of slides on Tuesday, July 28, 2020, that he took during his 40-year career. His assignments included the 1994 winter Olympics in Norway, the 1998 winter Olympics in Japan, and Pope John Paul II’s visit to Canada in 1984 while Alkofer was still a college student. He also photographed everyday people, including a local high school student who is allergic to the sun. Alkofer plans on doing a “big slide show” at his living wake in Minnesota.

She talks to Anushka Asthana about why the focus on “mass shootings” obscures the violence that really drives America’s gun violence crisis. Less than 3% of America’s gun homicide victims die in what are generally considered “mass shootings”. But none of the community shootings last year prompted national debates over what we should do to prevent this kind of violence, and rarely do people dig into the reasons behind a community shooting or the motivation of the shooter – if they’re ever arrested. The mass shooting debate is not just biased, it is actively harmful and racist, she says. Inaccurate and reductive euphemisms such as “Black on Black crime”, “inner-city violence” or “gang violence” still frequently warp descriptions of the daily experiences of communities of colour. Rarely are stories of grieving Black and brown families and their deceased loved ones granted the same carefulness in language as high-profile mass shootings.

Since the morning in October 2018 when a gunman showed up at Shabbat services and killed 11 worshipers, the somber building complex has been by turns a crime scene, a place of mourning and the subject of long, emotional discussions about its future. Slowly, over months of deliberation, the Tree of Life congregation came to decide that the building would be both its home for worship again as well as a commemorative site, a center for communal events and a place for people from all over the world to learn about confronting hatred. By Tuesday morning, the leadership of the congregation was ready to announce the person chosen to help turn that vision into structure: Daniel Libeskind, the architect known for memorializing historical trauma and a son of Holocaust survivors. “To me, in the end, the most critical thing is not that people stand there with their jaws literally hanging on the ground as they look at it,” Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life said. “But that they can be able to say, ‘Well look what the Tree of Life has accomplished. In the wake of what happened to them, that they could be at this incredible moment.’ And we think Daniel Libeskind’s the one to be able to deliver that.” There has been no shortage in recent years of places that once snugly fit into the patchwork of local communities — schools, churches, synagogues, grocery stores — but suddenly became internationally recognized sites of gun violence. As the acute trauma receded in those places and life in the community mostly resumed, charged conversations have followed about how or even whether to mark what had happened there. Sanctuaries and classrooms have been replaced, but questions linger about how to do justice to memory. These questions can take years to answer, if they are answered at all. In Newtown, Conn., where 20 first graders and six educators were killed in a mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, residents voted by a narrow margin to build a memorial only last week. At some places, like Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., where nine Black worshipers were killed in 2015, the planned commemorations have tied individual tragedy to a greater struggle against violence and hatred. The vision at Tree of Life is similar, recognizing there are many overlapping circles of people who feel a stake in the site: the families of those who were killed, the members of the three congregations that worshiped at the synagogue, the Pittsburgh Jewish community, the city at large, the country as a whole and people, Jewish and non-Jewish, all over the world. Mr. Libeskind, who in 2003 won the competition to design the World Trade Center site after the Sept. 11 attacks, said strong but often conflicting motivations were familiar in undertakings like these. “The same range, spectrum of emotions, ran through that project,” he said of the World Trade Center design process. “Many groups, competing groups with different emotions. You know, ‘Raze everything.’ ‘Rebuild even bigger, even taller.’ ‘Rebuild exactly the Twin Towers.’ ‘Don’t build anything for the next 30 years.’” “That is the range that you get,” he continued. “There are different aspects that people want to remember and to delay and also to confront.” Mr. Libeskind had been in New York when the attack at Tree of Life occurred. He has designed museums and memorials that commemorate the evils of the Holocaust, but it rattled him deeply, he said, that such an eruption of violent anti-Semitism could take place in America — the country his family had come to seeking freedom as Jews. He would soon learn that the suspect had apparently chosen Tree of Life because one of the three congregations that worshiped there, Dor Hadash, had participated in a program for refugees with HIAS. Under its original name as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the same group had given Mr. Libeskind’s family members financial assistance and helped them rent a home in Bronx public housing when they arrived as immigrants in 1959. “That struck in my heart,” he said. In Pittsburgh, the months that followed the attack were filled with grief, condolence and recitations of the mourner’s Kaddish. The wounded began to recover and some worshipers poured their anguish into activism. The gears of the judicial process began to turn, if slowly; the man charged with attacking the synagogue has yet to go to trial. But in those first few weeks were also the beginnings of a delicate conversation about the building itself. In December 2018, a Pittsburgh urban design firm, Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, began holding a series of listening sessions with members of the three congregations at the synagogue, which had been gathering for worship in the smaller chapels of other synagogues in Pittsburgh. Opinions about the future of the Tree of Life building ranged widely, from demolishing it to rebuilding it exactly as it had been to creating something new. Two of the congregations, Dor Hadash and New Light, decided not to return. But, Rabbi Myers said, a consensus began to form among members of Tree of Life that they wanted to come back. “As time went on, it became clearer through all of these conversations,” he said, “that the predominance was: We must return. If we don’t, we give the message that evil won, because it chased us out of our building.” They would refurbish the 58-year-old sanctuary, keeping the tall stained-glass windows that are the synagogue’s most striking feature. But they would rebuild the rest of the campus, creating classrooms, a communal space, a Hall of Memories dedicated to the attack itself and a home for exhibitions and public programs of the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh. The process of selecting an architect began this past winter, with requests sent to nearly a dozen firms. What followed were letters and interviews and conversations with various architectural firms, but Paula Garret, who led the selection committee, said it was quickly drawn to Mr. Libeskind, who wrote of his identity as a European Jew and his belief in American freedom. “Daniel Libeskind wants to design the Tree of Life building in Pittsburgh?” she said of the committee’s initial reaction. “We were blown away. But we were also so impressed with his deliberate and sensitive answers. He really, really got the understanding of this vision.” Mr. Libeskind, who will collaborate on the remodeling with Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, said he planned to visit the site, for the first time, this month. The project will undoubtedly take time, but the congregation is eager for a permanent home, having been exiled from their building by the shooting and then kept from any physical gatherings at all by the coronavirus. In an emailed statement, Andrea Wedner, who was shot in the arm that October morning and whose mother, 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, was killed, described the news about Mr. Libeskind as “an exciting next step in this long process of rebuilding.” “I am looking forward to entering a new Tree of Life building,” Ms. Wedner wrote, “without fear or hesitation.” Michele Rosenthal’s brothers Cecil, 59, and David, 54, both men with developmental disabilities, met worshipers at the door before services every week. “They welcomed everyone who came through their doors to share their beloved building,” she said in a statement on Monday. “We are hopeful that this new chapter for the building will be an opportunity to remember those who were taken and welcome more people in.” Advertisement",2021-05-04 03:00:10,"Tree of Life Synagogue Plans a New Beginning, Years After Deadly Shooting",,1,http://nytimes.com
201,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/650785234/0/phoenix/nation~COVID-front-lines-need-community-health-workers-yet-theyre-not-getting-needed-support/,"As a community health worker and executive director of the National Association of Community Health Workers, I’ve spent the past year gathering insights about the mental and emotional challenges for the people on the front lines of pandemic response in neighborhoods across America. I know well the anxiety and guilt they feel trying to comfort and support families who’ve struggled through loss after loss in isolation and uncertainty. Yet, on top of pandemic-induced pressures, recent events form a grim reminder of other, enduring American crises that our community responders face: a string of mass shootings and the catastrophic consequences of racism. The horror of the March 16 Atlanta mass shooting of eight individuals, six of whom were from Asian communities, floored me. After the news broke, I called Theanvy Kuoch, a Cambodian CHW who has been a mentor, elder and friend for 10 years. Long before she had the title of community health worker, Theanvy channeled her lived experience as a survivor of enslavement, hunger, disease and loss from the 1970s Cambodian holocaust to support people living in her refugee camp. Four decades ago, Theanvy founded Khmer Health Advocates in America, bringing trauma-informed therapy, health and social services to other newly arriving refugees. During my recent call to Theanvy, so many questions flooded my brain. How was she doing? How had the news of the Atlanta killings of Asian women, along with the rise in overall racist attacks against Asian Americans, affected her? Affected her clients? And what did she and other CHWs need from partners and allies to be able to provide services in her community? In the ongoing scramble to confront and conquer COVID-19, America needs to sharpen its focus on unheralded front-line community workers like Theanvy. Daily, community health workers push past their own risk factors and barriers to ensure that the families they serve can get tested for and gain equitable access to vaccinations and medical treatments. By the end of April 2020, when the COVID-19 death toll in the United States was over 62,000, Theanvy and I had collaborated with the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative to create a guide for CHWs that addressed the growing violence, stigma and blame against persons of Asian descent. We wanted to promote ways that CHWs can support our Asian American and Pacific Islander community members. They’re doing the work of contact tracing, street outreach, eviction support, delivering diapers, medicine and food, advocating for immigrant rights and worker protections, and grieving with families. It's work that would challenge the most physically and emotionally healthy among us. As the STOP AAPI Hate website tracks increasing crimes against Asian Americans, Theanvy and other CHWs must increase their daily workloads by accompanying people who are afraid to go the grocery store or to travel to get their vaccine. They’re also comforting people suffering from depression and anxiety due to racial violence. And they’re doing it without bonuses or subsidies, and with no fanfare. Advocating for CHWs has never been easy. Most provide their services outside of established health services and systems. As a precarious workforce, predominantly made up of females of color in some of the lowest-paying public health jobs, they often lack career advancement opportunities. Our community-based organizations are often not eligible to apply for grants that fund CHW services and research. Without infrastructure support, our power to advocate for vulnerable communities is diminished. In the early days of the pandemic, the Department of Homeland Security identified CHWs as essential critical infrastructure workers who can provide significant contributions to COVID-19 emergency response efforts. This guidance, along with nearly 60 years of research on CHW effectiveness, two decades of public health recognition, landmark workforce development studies and a national labor classification, should have engendered respect and authentic partnership with CHWs as public health professionals. Sadly, many of us remain undervalued. In February, my organization released a National CHW Policy Platform, created over the past year with hundreds of community health workers, networks and allies. It is an important tool to promote national professional identity, leadership and capacity of CHWs and our associations. These policy recommendations feature best practices that can guide integration into larger COVID-19 response efforts. But unless public and private institutions heed the advice, these vital workers will continue to be sidelined. It is past time to recognize the underappreciated expertise and capacity of our community health care workers, many of whom are coping with immense suffering and an ever-increasing need for their services. With vision, we can transform our experiences during the pandemic into an authentic movement for health equity, with adequately supported community health workers at the center. Denise Octavia Smith, the founding executive director of the National Association of Community Health Workers, is an Aspen Institute Healthy Communities fellow.

202,https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/im-filipina-american-and-racism-makes-me-afraid-me-my-family,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement I could be the next victim of anti-Asian hate. I am a Filipina American living in Chicago. Following one of the latest violent attacks against Asian Americans — a 65-year-old Filipina beaten by a stranger as she walked to church in Manhattan — I thought about my mother and aunties. I have so much anger, so much rage at the realization that any of us might be the next victims. The New York attack is just one of the many that have happened across this country over the past year. My community is facing various tragedies, from the pandemic that rages on to the hate-fueled rhetoric people needlessly and carelessly associate with the virus. Recent numbers shared by Stop AAPI Hate show that there were nearly 3,800 instances of discrimination against Asian Americans in the last year. I learned about the mass shooting in Atlanta in March through text messages from friends and family. They all relayed the simple but all too familiar words: ""I'm afraid."" This is a time when Asian Americans need their leaders to stand up and provide a bold defense. President Joe Biden introduced a nearly $50 million plan to address this type of violence. But where is the Catholic Church in these times of crisis? During the early months of the pandemic, the U.S. bishops' conference put forth a statement regarding discrimination and xenophobia that members of the Asian American community experienced. Members of the bishops' conference shared concerns for many communities whose members had experienced racism. But statements need actions behind them to move toward transformation. Racism against the Asian American community needs a louder, unified and more renewed message of hope and an even stronger course of action by our leaders. The U.S. bishops' document ""Open Wide Our Hearts"" addresses important forms of racism and calls for justice. However, the document makes no reference to the Asian-American community. I barely notice myself, or my ancestors, in the pastoral statement. Targeting Asians in America isn't an emerging trend. Anti-Asian sentiment dates back to the Page Act of 1875 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, both policies passed by our nation's leaders to curb Asian immigration. The 1900s didn't get easier. Filipinos were put on display at a Philippine village exhibit titled the ""Philippine Exposition"" at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, as if we were beasts to be examined. Later, Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1982, Vincent Chin, a Chinese American man, was murdered in Detroit by two white autoworkers who felt threatened by Japanese auto imports. Advertisement Advertisement The same year that ""Open Wide Our Hearts"" was released, the U.S. bishops' conference published a document that addressed the specific needs of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, titled ""Encountering Christ in Harmony."" The document described the gifts of the AAPI community. In a section that refers to racism, it reads, ""Asian and Pacific Island Catholics need to remind the larger ecclesial communities that all are invited to the table."" I wonder how issues of racism from an anti-Asian American lens can make it into one document but not into another. If we are to be more intentional about broadening the U.S. perspective experience, then we have to make sure all voices are included from the inception of a document through the histories we tell through our documents. How would such a document center experiences like mine? *** My earliest experience of racial trauma happened in a Catholic school. I was testing for entry into a kindergarten in the San Francisco Bay Area — specifically, the school attached to the parish where I was baptized and attended Mass each week. The offhand comments made to my family were, ""There were already too many Filipinos in the school."" Undeterred, my parents stood resolute in our faith and enrolled me at a different Catholic school. It turned out to be a great school, but also a place where I had the classic ""Asian lunchbox story."" In the first grade, a classmate told me my food was gross because I had chicken and rice. Filipino BBQ chicken was my dad's specialty, but I was made to feel ashamed that my food wasn't good enough. I thought about asking my parents for sandwiches just to avoid being teased. It was the 1980s and I was only a 6-year-old Filipina American, but already racism had traumatized me. As a young adult in the Bay Area I'd also heard remarks such as ""Where are you from?"" or was told that my ""English is good."" My brother experienced racism also in his work as a restaurant server when a customer once called him a ""Chinaman."" I need my son's world and church to be more equitable and inclusive than the one I grew up in, and the one we live in today. Tweet this As a mother of a Black and Filipino child I can understand in the deepest places within my heart that we as a church must actively and consistently continue to analyze how racism has affected Black Americans. This work, however, must be done in a way that rejects a Black/white binary that excludes how racism affects communities like mine. The Catholic Church's anti-racism lens must evolve. I need my son's world and church to be more equitable and inclusive than the one I grew up in, and the one we live in today. I wish to see local and national leaders, who are committed Catholics, learning more about Asian American history and culture and uplifting our stories in their communities. Our non-Asian brothers and sisters can perhaps take a deep dive and read Asian American authors and poets to hear our struggles and better understand the depth of racism that has always existed toward us. Perhaps even understanding how to disrupt a hate crime when you see it happening before you. These hate crimes against the AAPI community are not a new phenomenon. Catholics, from religious classrooms to youth ministry gatherings to parking lots after Mass, must attempt to understand the depths of racism to hear how we have overcome and continue to struggle in this way. The work of undoing and growing to become more anti-racist is difficult, and people are rightfully afraid. But we Asian Americans are scared too — we fear the violence deployed against our women, men and children. It is time for our non-Asian brothers and sisters to act and to do better.

Judge Lina Hidalgo announced that anyone in Harris County or the greater Houston area 16 or older will be able to receive the COVID-19 two-dose Pfizer vaccine at the FEMA Community Vaccination Center at NRG Park with or without an appointment. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo on Tuesday received a national boost from a prominent Democratic women’s group. EMILY’s List, the influential group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, named Hidalgo as its 2021 “EMILY’s List Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award” winner, a designation that brings with it exposure to national donors and other powerful Democratic constituencies. “We are honored to announce Judge Lina Hidalgo as the recipient of the 2021 EMILY’s List Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award,” Emily Cain, EMILY’s List’s executive director, said in a news release. “Lina, the first woman and first Latina to be elected Harris County judge and only the second to be elected to Harris County’s Commissioners Court, truly embodies the values this award represents by leading with compassion, commitment to community, and as a champion for families.” READ MORE: A shortage of single-family homes has sparked a buying frenzy in Houston “Under Lina’s leadership, Harris County has made tremendous progress toward becoming a more safe, equitable, and just community for all of its residents,” Cain added. “We are proud to recognize Lina’s fearless leadership and positive impact on her community, and celebrate her as a rising star and inspiration to others in American politics.” Hidalgo shocked the Texas political scene in 2018, when at the age of 27 she won her post as the county judge of the third-largest county in the nation. Her management over the last year of the COVID-19 crisis and expanded access to voting often put her at odds with state Republican leaders and elevated her profile in progressive circles. She is often mentioned as a potential gubernatorial candidate this cycle. EMILY’s List initiated the Rising Star Award in 2014 and its namesake is former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, who retired after she was shot in the head in a 2010 mass shooting incident in Tucson, Arizona. Giffords’ husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, is now a U.S. senator representing Arizona. The first recipient of the award was former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams. Hidalgo is the first Texan to win this recognition.

204,https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2021/05/04/the_curious_case_of_the_asian_american_victim_774865.html,"The mass shooting in Atlanta on March 16, which took the lives of six Asian women among the eight victims, appears to be a one-off event – the violent act of a deeply troubled 21-year-old man who, according to what he told the police, was trying to wipe away sexual temptation, in the form of massage parlors that he felt guilty patronizing. But that's not how the incident was treated by the Asian American commentariat. Instead, a consensus quickly formed among journalists, scholars, and cultural figures writing op-eds and giving broadcast interviews that the shooting represented a pervasive, historical victimization by Asian people at the hands of the white majority. It was almost as if shootings of Asian women by white gunmen were an everyday occurrence, rather than a singular, exceedingly rare event. Bee Nguyen, the first Asian woman to be elected to the George state assembly, declared at a rally four days after the shooting that the incident requires us “to demand justice not only for these victims but for all victims of white supremacy.” The Asian-American Association of Massachusetts, a supposedly nonpartisan group established by the state legislature, issued a statement blaming the attack on “misogyny, white supremacy, and the historical portrayal of Asians as the 'Yellow Peril.'” The Korean American novelist R.O. Kwon wrote a “letter to my fellow Asian women whose hearts are breaking,” published in Vanity Fair, saying that the Atlanta murders represented “the passing of women shot for what they looked like, killed by a racist gunman and by this country's white supremacy.” Two days after the attack, the page one headline in The New York Times read, “How Racism and Sexism Intertwine to Torment Asian-American Women,” with the article quoting several women excoriating the Atlanta police for even thinking that the massage parlor shootings may not have been racially motivated. There were no views on the other side of the issue in the Times coverage. Similarly in a New York Times podcast, the poet and essayist Cathy Park Hong said, “We have also been victims to systemic racism throughout history,” except, she continued, “we have been conditioned to pretend that it doesn't exist.” “I think that came from the white supremacist system that we live in,” she added. The country may be used to this sort of narrative, with its intersectionality vocabulary of racial oppression and sexism. Looked at historically, these terms do contain kernels of truth when applied to Asian Americans, who have experienced plenty of both exclusion and violence in the past. Still, the prevailing narrative for Asian peoples in America over the last quarter-century and longer has told a success story. Asians may experience a certain residual bigotry, but they have overcome it, the story goes, turning themselves into the “model minority.” The values of hard work, studiousness, and the postponement of gratification won them a disproportionate number of slots at the country's most coveted schools and helped them become the wealthiest large ethnic group in America. But that all was ignored in the wake of the Atlanta shooting, with commentary turning instead to a narrative of victimization at the hands of the same supposedly white supremacist America that has, in what seems a contradiction, welcomed them as immigrants and allowed them to prosper. This is significant. It signals the ever-growing expansion into the mainstream of a set of ideas once considered the province of a radical political and academic fringe. Asian Americans — or at least the Asian Americans paid attention to by the mainstream media — apparently have adopted a version of critical race theory, the notion that America is divided into white oppressors and the non-white oppressed, and that history consists of the effort of the former to maintain the “structures of oppression” that ensure its dominance over the latter. Through this lens, the triumphalist narrative of Asian success is a patronizing expression of racism. “The dangerous and racist ideology” of the “model minority” is “a means to really minimize and silence and erase the diverse, rich Asian experience in order to reinforce and maintain systemic racism and oppression,” Anastasia Kim, an associate professor of psychology at the Wright Institute in Berkeley, California, said in a colloquium on the Atlanta murders. In many ways, the growing embrace of this narrative of systemic racism and white supremacy, at least among the intelligentsia, represents the continued assimilation of Asian Americans – like other groups, they too are embracing their victimhood. They, too, are highlighting discriminatory events from the past. But the effort is fraught not only because of the broad success that many millions of Asian Americans have enjoyed in supposedly white supremacist America, but also because of the complex politics of race itself. The very term Asian American is an arbitrary construct, one that throws together people from more than 20 countries and regions that in many cases have no more to do with each other culturally or racially than they do with Africa or Europe. Conditions vary considerably among them. Indian Americans have the highest average household incomes in America; people originating in Cambodia, Bhutan, and Bangladesh are less prosperous. There are Hmong refugees and other tribal groups from Laos; the descendants of Vietnam boat people who escaped South Vietnam after the communist takeover there in 1975; rich ethnic Chinese tycoons and ethnic Chinese and Korean workers in nail salons, dry cleaners and restaurants. Almost nothing, except the mania for creating ethnic groupings and contrasting them with the supposedly dominant whites, justifies putting them into the same category. In that sense, what's called anti-Asian violence has really mostly been violence against Chinese Americans or other people who are mistaken for them, carried out by people angry over the “China virus.” According to the group Stop AAPI Hate (AAPI standing for Asian-American Pacific Islanders) there have been some 3800 reported assaults against Asians since the early days of the COVID pandemic, a sharp increase from previous years -- with the race or ethnicity of the victimizers often not described. Citing this figure and the Atlanta-area shootings, the Senate last month passed a bill by a 94-1 vote titled ""The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act."" “To me it's pretty shocking, because I know that it's not something new,” Min Zhou, the director of the Asian American ethnic studies program at UCLA, said in a Zoom interview. “Historically Asians were discriminated against. It's on and off, and when I say 'off' I mean it's just less visible. It has been there all along, but it gets heightened, and the impact has been profound on me personally.” It is understandable, especially given this history of anti-Asian discrimination, that many Asians and others would feel this way. The attacks have evoked memories of incidents, like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and 1982 killing of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American beaten to death by two white autoworkers enraged by competition from Japan – they mistakenly thought Chin was Japanese. Still, there are major differences between the past violence and exclusion and the current spike in violence, which major media seem largely to ignore. The country has officially repudiated the internment of Japanese Americans; President Reagan in 1988 formally apologized to them, and each surviving internee received a reparations payment of $20,000. The killing of Vincent Chin seems similar to the spike in anti-Asian violence, one related to fury over losses of jobs because of Japanese competition; the other an irrational fury at Chinese falsely supposed to be responsible for the COVID epidemic. Neither case, though, demonstrates some continuing, pervasive racial hatred of Asians much less some effort by white supremacy to keep Asians down. Nor does the spike in anti-Asian violence, however horrifying. Almost 90% of the incidents have been verbal or involve acts of shunning, and many of them appear to have come from mentally disturbed, often homeless people. A substantial number of the reported attacks have been carried out by other minority group members, especially blacks, though commentators cited in the media attribute even this to white supremacy. The public radio station in San Francisco, KQED, for example, interviewed Sherry Wang, a professor of counseling for Santa Clara County, on the reluctance of some victims to report on attacks against them for fear of encouraging anti-black feelings. Wang said that “these concerns about reporting racist incidents are reflections of the wider effect that white supremacy has on both Asian American communities and black communities.” In other words, when a black person knocks down an Asian woman and kicks her in the head, the fault lies with white people, a notion that the journalists at KQED approvingly reported. To point this out is not to minimize the shocking nature of the violence. In fact, one of the most vicious attacks, shown on security camera video, was of a man on a Manhattan street repeatedly kicking a 65-year-old Filipino woman in the head while shouting, “You don't belong here.” This understandably had a powerful impact, especially on Asian women who are a large majority of the reported victims. ð¨WANTED for ASSAULT: Do you know this guy?

Since the mid-1960s, 14 million Asian immigrants have arrived in the country. Different subgroups have had different outcomes, but the average household incomes of Indian Americans, Korean Americans, and Chinese Americans are substantially higher than whites, despite the latter’s supposed efforts to maintain their dominance. Lawsuits have been filed against Harvard and Yale by groups representing Asian students, claiming that they are held to a higher standard than other students in admissions decisions. Still, even with that higher standard, 20%-30% of the student bodies and a great deal of the faculties of the most exclusive universities in the land are of Asian descent. At the California Institute of Technology, which does not strive for racial balance in admissions, the number is 43%. And yet, the Asian American commentariat seems determined to have Asian Americans identified as a group victimized by white supremacy. One reason clearly is that, in the wake of the death of George Floyd and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, doing so has become fashionable. Liberal Asian Americans working in elite institutions wish, as do white liberals, to show solidarity with blacks, and one way to do that is to express a common victimization. “There's definitely a cool factor, especially for young people,” said Kenny Xu, a writer on these topics and author of the forthcoming book, “An Inconvenient Minority: The Attack on Asian American Excellence and the Fight for Meritocracy.” “Look at Hassan Minaj and his tirade in favor of affirmative action.” The reference was to the popular Indian American stand-up comic who a couple of years ago inaugurated a Netflix series, “Patriot Act,” by ridiculing the lawsuit brought by some Asian students against Harvard for allegedly discriminating against them in admissions. “I find it hilarious,” Minaj said, “that this is the hill we're willing to die on.” But the tropes of critical race theory long predate recent events. The academic world, especially the ethnic studies departments, have been preparing this ground for decades, promoting the idea that white supremacy is at the heart of the American experience, and the constant repetition of that notion has gradually transformed it from a theory to established, indisputable fact. Scott Kurashige, chair of the Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies Department at Texas Christian University, for example, put it this way in an interview with Vox: “What we need to realize is that there's this timeless structure in which there's always one group on top and another at the bottom. ... This country has had a white supremacist ruling class since the beginning.” Lok Siu, an associate professor of Asian American and Asian Diaspora Studies at UC-Berkeley, told the New York Times that anti-Asian violence is “built into the structure and built into the way we think of Asians and the way we insert Asians into society.” Asked to elaborate on this idea, she spoke of the long history of exclusion of Asians, going back to the ban on the immigration of Chinese women in 1875, followed by the ban on virtually all Asian immigration that lasted from 1925 to 1965, the murderous anti-Chinese riots in California and other places in the 19th century, the laws forbidding marriage between Asian men and white women, and even bans on land ownership by Asians. There's no question that for many decades America did treat Asians with systemic, legally enforced, exclusionary racism. “When you have these laws about who belongs and who doesn't belong, you're creating an ideology of distrust, that these people don't really belong here,” Siu said in a Zoom interview. “There's a bamboo ceiling that prevents Asian Americans from actually achieving full equity with white Americans, and that is still an issue. It's not written into law, but you can see can see how it functions, making Asians the perpetual foreigner, the yellow peril.” By no means do all Asian Americans agree with that analysis, or with the adoption of the critical race theory narrative. On contentious issues like affirmative action, there are bitter divides among Asian groups and between some of them. In the election last year, voters in California defeated by a 67% majority Proposition 16, which would have ended a state ban on racial preferences in state college admissions. Groups made up largely of ethnic Chinese played prominent roles on both sides of that issue. “Asians are caught in the crossfire of a culture war, with the progressive side seeking to inject traces of white supremacy into every situation to confirm their ideology,” said Wenyuan Wu, the executive director of Californians for Equal Rights, one of the groups that opposed Proposition 16. There are also aspects of the Asian American discourse that will be controversial among both Asians and non-Asians. Among the demands made by Stop AAPI Hate, the group reporting on the incidents of anti-Asian attacks, is that the United States discontinue the China Initiative, the Justice Department program to investigate technology theft by China and its agents in the country. The program, according to a letter the group sent to President Biden, “has led to the wrongful targeting and persecution of Chinese scientists.” One element in this picture, also originating in the academic world, is a concerted attack on the idea of the model minority, pejoratively called the Model Minority Myth by its detractors. The criticism, which has been made for at least a quarter-century, has been that it creates a misleading stereotype of the smart but nerdy Asian student, which leaves out Asians who don't fit the stereotype and need help. But in recent years, the attack against the model minority idea has been portrayed in CRT terms -- as an element in an insidious conspiracy to maintain white supremacy, because implicit in the notion of Asian success is assumption that if Blacks changed their behavior, they could do just as well, and it's their fault if they don't. “Why Be a 'Model Minority' When You Could Dismantle White Supremacy?” was the headline in a recent article in The Nation, written by Dae Shik Kim, a community organizer in Seattle. “Asian Americans have long been used as a tool by white supremacists to justify systemic racism against black people,” the author writes, voicing an argument and the vocabulary used by many others. A related notion, also with roots in academia, is what's called “adjacent whiteness” or “honorary whiteness” or “conditional whiteness.” It's the idea that the system of white supremacy has accorded Asians some of the presumed privileges of being white as a way of deterring solidarity among the supposedly oppressed groups. “Conditional whiteness ... weaponizes people of color against their own communities by making individuals complicit in perpetuating racism and exhibiting dominance over other non-white bodies,” one writer, Dorothy He, said in the online journal Reappropriate. That seemingly radical statement has gone mainstream. In the ethnic studies curriculum recently adopted by the California Board of Education, one of the sample lessons is “Asian American Pacific Islanders and the Model Minority Myth.” According to the curriculum guidelines, students in that class “will understand how this label for AAPIs becomes a hindrance to expanding democratic structures and support and, at worst, how it creates a division among the AAPI community and places a wedge between them and other oppressed groups.” In other words, from now on, when it comes to describing the Asian American experience in California schools, the ideas of critical race theory will be treated as accepted truths. The California curriculum was devised as a model for the rest of the country, and other states are likely to follow it. “The radical narrative caricatures Asian American reliance on hard work, initiative, and an emphasis on education, not as the agency of Asian Americans but as the features of an oppressive system that stereotypes us into 'white adjacency,” Wu of Californians for Equal Rights said. “It's an insidious idea.”  This and all other original articles created by RealClearInvestigations may be republished for free with attribution.

205,https://www.rawstory.com/nut-should-be-on-a-watch-list-marjorie-taylor-greene-slammed-for-ar-15-style-gun-giveaway/,"U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on Tuesday will announce the winner of her gun giveaway for a $2860 Honey Badger ""pistol"" by Q. Like everything Greene does the giveaway is designed for one thing only. ""This is the same type of gun that TRIGGERS the Fake News Media and Democrats all across the country,"" she says on the entry page. ""And it's the same type of gun the hate-America gun-grabbers in DC would love to BAN if they ever get the votes."" That's true. The ""pistol"" is an AR-15 style weapon. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives last year issued a cease and desist letter to the manufacturer, but Trump's DOJ stepped in and effectively nullified the order, according to a gun website. Greene's giveaway is also in response to President Joe Biden signing executive orders to protect Americans from gun violence. The nation has seen a tremendous increase in mass shootings this year. As of today 14,582 people have died due to gun violence, according to the Gun Violence Archive. That number includes 497 children 17-years of age or younger. There have been 180 mass shootings to date – a mass shooting is when four or more people have been shot (not including the shooter) in one event. In response to Greene's announcement that she will be announcing the winner of the gun, many were furious. Some are demanding House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ban these types of events. ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

206,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pandemic-ebbs-fear-mass-shootings-77488354,"After a year of pandemic lockdowns, mass shootings are back — but the guns never went away US reeling amid rise in mass shootings PORTLAND, Ore. -- Brianne Smith was overjoyed to get an e-mail telling her to schedule a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Hours later, her relief was replaced by dread: a phone alert — another mass public shooting. Before the pandemic, she would scan for the nearest exit in public places and routinely practiced active shooter drills at the company where she works. But after a year at home in the pandemic, those anxieties had faded. Until now. “I haven't been living in fear with COVID because I'm able to make educated decisions to keep myself safe,” says Smith, 21, who lives in St. Louis, Missouri. “But there’s no way I can make an educated decision about what to do to avoid a mass shooting. I've been at home for a year and I'm not as practiced at coping with that fear as I used to be.” After a year of pandemic lockdowns, public mass shootings are back. For many, the fear of contracting an invisible virus is suddenly compounded by the forgotten yet more familiar fear of getting caught in a random act of violence. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks mass killings — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — showed just two public mass shootings in 2020. Since Jan. 1, there have been at least 11. Yet while mass shootings dropped out of the headlines, the guns never went away. Instead, even as the U.S. inches toward a post-pandemic future, guns and gun violence feel more embedded in the American psyche than ever before. The fear and isolation of the past year have worked their way into every aspect of the U.S. conversation on firearms, from gun ownership to inner-city violence to the erosion of faith in common institutions meant to keep us safe. MORE GUN OWNERS, AND DIFFERENT More than 21 million people completed a background check to buy a gun last year, shattering all previous records, and a survey found that 40% identified as new gun owners — many of whom belong to demographics not normally associated with firearms, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm industry trade association. Purchases of guns by Black Americans increased 58% over 2019 and sales to Hispanics went up 46%, the group says. Gun advocates tie this increase to pandemic anxiety and a loss of faith in the ability of police officers and government institutions at all levels to keep the public safe amid what at first was a little-understood, invisible menace. The eruption of sustained racial injustice protests after the police killing of George Floyd and calls to reduce police funding also contributed to more interest in firearms. One of those buyers was Charles Blain, a 31-year-old Black man in Houston who purchased a Glock 43 handgun and a shotgun for the first time last year. Blain, who describes himself as a conservative, says ""pandemic-related unemployment crime” and repeated calls over the past year to release hundreds of jail inmates because of soaring COVID-19 infections pushed him to buy. “I was always gun-friendly, but never really felt the need to own one myself,” says Blain, who founded Urban Reform, which helps underserved communities get involved in policy decisions that impact them. The dramatic rise in firearms ownership represents a “tectonic shift in the conversation on guns,"" says Mark Oliva, the foundation's director of public affairs. “For these people, gun ownership and gun control was until now a rhetorical debate. It was something you could discuss at a cocktail hour, but they had no skin the game — and then they bought guns,” he says. “It's hard to put today's gun owner into a box,” Oliva added. Gun rights advocates feel good about what this could mean for gun policy, with a broader swath of society seeing themselves when they hear about gun control efforts. At the same time, gun-related homicides in midsized and big cities in America have skyrocketed during coronavirus, and criminologists believe the pandemic and the socioeconomic loss in many communities are factors driving that trend. A study by the Council on Criminal Justice tracked a 30% increase in homicides overall in a sample of 34 U.S. cities in 2020 as well as an 8% increase in gun assaults. “We’ve been trying to sound the alarm, but the No. 1 priority is COVID because nothing happens until COVID is fixed,” says Alex Piquero, a criminologist and professor at the University of Miami who conducted research for the Council on Criminal Justice's COVID-19 commission. “This is the long-term symptom of the disease and ... the long-term mental health effects of this are going to be staggering.” Portland, Oregon, a city of just over 650,000 people, is a         stark example. Last year, there were more homicides than in any of the previous 26 years. This year, the city had tallied more than 340 shootings by late April — an average of about three a day — and was on track to blow past last year's homicide record. The shootings are mostly impacting the city's historically Black neighborhoods and lower-income areas where coronavirus has taken a heavy toll. In one instance, a Black pastor involved in a coalition to address the violence had to hurry off a Zoom meeting about the crisis because gunfire erupted nearby. In March, a 14-year-old boy was seriously wounded by gunfire while he stood with friends near a soccer field. “It’s the way that we all feel as people who have careers and homes and jobs and how emotionally unstable we’ve felt over this past year. Now imagine all that in people who are in hopeless situations,” says Sam Thompson, a Black resident who started a neighborhood group last summer to try to find solutions. MORE POLITICS THAN EVER When it comes to the gun control debate, Americans seem “more entrenched than ever,"" and those divisions are playing out in state legislatures around the nation, says David Kopel, a law professor at the University of Denver and research director at the Independence Institute, a Libertarian think tank in Colorado that favors gun rights. After a year of isolation, loss and stress, the nation is akin to a patient in an acute mental health crisis — and there is a growing chasm of opinion on whether guns are part of the remedy, or a symptom of the disease. In conservative America, mask mandates and economic shutdowns have been lumped together with gun control legislation as examples of vast government overreach. Liberal legislatures, meanwhile, have moved to lessen gun access and tighten rules to prevent more mass shootings as a more heavily armed nation opens up. “When you’re getting told, 'Look, the cops just can’t be there because they’ve all got COVID' or, depending on the state, you may not be able to buy a gun because the licensing departments are getting overwhelmed — all those things came into play,"" Kopel says. “You now have state (gun) laws that are directly pandemic-related.” In North Carolina, for example, lawmakers         are considering a bill to remove a century-old requirement for a local sheriff's permit to buy a pistol, a policy that came under scrutiny when one sheriff briefly stopped handling the paperwork because of COVID-19. In other conservative states, lawmakers have passed or are debating pandemic-inspired laws that do everything from strengthen a ban on using the government's emergency powers to confiscate firearms to allowing gun owners to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. In Oregon,         armed protesters angry that the state Capitol was closed to the public due to COVID-19 tried to storm the building late last year in a foreshadowing of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In response, Democrats are using their supermajority to advance a bill that would mandate safe storage for firearms and make it illegal to bring a gun into the state Capitol. In Colorado, a         gun storage bill was recently signed into law and in Massachusetts, lawmakers are considering a ban on the manufacture of assault weapons in that state — a bill introduced after the recent spate of mass shootings. If recent months are any indication, for years to come the debate about guns will hold the echoes of our shared pandemic trauma and the seismic shifts it brought to our notions of safety, freedom and well-being. Yet in one area, some see the potential to reduce the polarization around guns: the increasing focus of public health in the national conversation. The idea that gun violence is a public health threat — just like the coronavirus and the pandemic it caused — could transform the way Americans talk about guns. “How can we learn to live with the guns, whereas right now we’re dying with them?"" says David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University. ""The public health approach in a one-sentence description is, ‘Let’s make it really easy to be healthy and really difficult to get sick and injured.' We have to agree we have a big problem and it’s a societal problem. Then, there are so many things we can talk about.” ——— Follow Flaccus on Twitter at         http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus. ——— This story has been corrected to show that University of Miami professor Alex Piquero conducted research for the Council on Criminal Justice’s COVID-19 commission but is not a member of the commission. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-04 15:57:39,Old mass shooting fears new again as pandemic ebbs,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Jacqui Irwin, D-Thousand Oaks, is motivated by the best of intentions. Last year, relatives of many of the dozen victims of the tragic 2018 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill filed a lawsuit to the block release of records pertaining to the incident, citing privacy concerns. AB 268, sponsored by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, would require the sealing of “the autopsy report and any evidence associated with the examination” of someone killed as a result of a criminal act upon the request of a relative. The bill would also require such records to be sealed  “when a prosecutorial agency has concluded all persons who could have been prosecuted for the criminal act have died.” Under current law, public agencies already have the discretion to redact information contained in autopsy reports if doing so is in the public interest. For cases where there are stronger disputes over privacy protections and the public interest, the court system is fully capable of adjudicating such disputes. But what AB 268 seeks to do is to broadly exclude information that is in the public interest on arbitrary grounds. The First Amendment Coalition notes two problems with the bill.  “[AB 268] allows family members who have witnessed or played a role in the decedent’s death, but were not prosecuted in the death, to invoke the sealing process. Second, it grants prosecutorial agencies broad and unfettered discretion to make findings that could result in sealing,” the First Amendment Coalition argues. Related Articles

The American Civil Liberties Union likewise notes that the law “threatens to reduce access to records that could provide information regarding the cause of death of a person due to inappropriate and unlawful conduct by law enforcement,” by requiring the sealing of records upon the discretion of prosecutors. Finally, the proposal would undermine the ability of the press to accurately report on incidents like mass shootings which, by their nature, merit public scrutiny. As with anything in public policy, there are competing interests and tradeoffs to any decision. AB 268 simply goes too far in subverting access to information in the public interest.

The American Civil Liberties Union likewise notes that the law “threatens to reduce access to records that could provide information regarding the cause of death of a person due to inappropriate and unlawful conduct by law enforcement,” by requiring the sealing of records upon the discretion of prosecutors. Finally, the proposal would undermine the ability of the press to accurately report on incidents like mass shootings which, by their nature, merit public scrutiny. As with anything in public policy, there are competing interests and tradeoffs to any decision. AB 268 simply goes too far in subverting access to information in the public interest.

But many feel it flattens and erases entire cultures. This article is part of the Asian American identity series. Sarath Suong has often felt like the term “Asian American” doesn’t really serve him. “I was told that I am Asian American when we came here,” says Suong, a Cambodian refugee who immigrated to the US as a child. “But I faced a lot of colorism, a lot of classism, and not a lot of understanding about who Southeast Asians are and how we fit into the Asian American context.” Suong’s family was among tens of thousands of refugees who fled during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, eventually settling in the Boston area. When he arrived in the US, he struggled to find his footing in a country where everyone from teachers to neighbors made him feel unwelcome. “Growing up for me, I felt so disempowered,” he told Vox. “I was always wondering why people in my community were getting harassed and being thrown in jail by the police.” That experience, Suong says, wasn’t reflected in how the media — or even members of the community — talked about Asian Americans. As white writers pushed the idea of the “model minority myth” — a racist trope that suggests that all Asian Americans are well off and pits them against other groups — Suong feared for his friends’ deportations and violence at the hands of cops. And as he advocated for more resources in Southeast Asian neighborhoods, he didn’t always feel heard by other Asian Americans, either. “Trying to enter spaces with predominantly wealthy, light-skinned East Asians, there was a dismissal of us,” he said. All this has led Suong, now 40 and the head of the Southeast Asian Freedom Network, to be wary of such a sweeping category — and how it excludes some of its most vulnerable members. While Asian American was a term established by activists in the 1960s as a means to build political power, it’s also been criticized for obscuring the immense diversity among those it purports to cover, centering East Asians and preventing specific ethnic groups from getting the policy support they need. Asian Americans not only have the largest income gap of any racial group but also massive health care, education, and economic disparities that rarely get addressed. Cambodian refugees like Suong, and Southeast Asians in particular, are among those who’ve been overlooked: 19 percent of Cambodians live in poverty in the US, compared to 12 percent of Asian people and 15 percent of all people. In the 1980s and ’90s the classification was broadened even further via the term Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, a decision that’s proven contentious as well. (In 1997, the US government disaggregated Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in its data, though the vestiges of this umbrella category remain. See: AAPI Heritage Month, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and Asian Pacific American studies departments at numerous colleges.) The term AAPI is also meant to be inclusive, but its usage — by government agencies in particular — has had the opposite effect. “AAPI is incredibly ambitious. It contends to cover and speak for some of the largest regions in the world,” says Tavae Samuelu, the executive director of Empowering Pacific Islander Communities. “In some ways, marginalization and erasure feel inevitable.” The terms Asian American and AAPI, in their most idealized versions, have at times historically served as a unifying banner for a wide range of communities to work together toward a common cause. They signify, too, a sense of shared experience tied to what it’s like to be an immigrant, or part of a family of immigrants, and the xenophobia that different groups have encountered, a connection that’s been especially apparent in the wake of recent attacks targeting Asian American people during the pandemic. “The thing that these Asian American communities [have in common] is the experience of perhaps being viewed as outsiders,” says Indiana University’s Dina Okamoto. “Maybe you arrived 10 years ago, but maybe your family has also been in the US for generations. There are experiences of being othered these communities share.” But this connection can be tenuous and this label so broad that recent calls for data disaggregation and more visible recognition of the roughly 50 ethnic groups that make up the Asian diaspora have surfaced. In conversations with more than 20 people who spoke about their Asian American identities, there was a huge focus on acknowledging the different needs that various groups may have — and an emphasis on the fact that the community is no monolith. “Are Asian Americans one or many?” asks UC Riverside political science professor Karthick Ramakrishnan. “The answer is both.” The term Asian American was once a radical one. First used by UC Berkeley student activists Emma Gee and Yuji Ichioka in 1968, “Asian American” was used to unite different communities of Asian descent in order to create a more formidable protest bloc, an approach inspired by the Black Power movement. Their strength in numbers proved more impactful than individual ethnic groups working alone, including working alongside Black and Latino students for an ethnic studies department at the college. “There were so many Asians out there in the political demonstrations but we had no effectiveness,” Ichioka has said previously in an interview with UC San Diego ethnic studies professor Yến Lê Espiritu. “Everyone was lost in the larger rally. We figured that if we rallied behind our own banner, behind an Asian American banner, we would have an effect on the larger public.” The rise of the term also helped combat the use of more derogatory language that referred to people of Asian descent. Before “Asian American” was popularized, the word “Oriental,” a label that othered and exoticized those it described, was common parlance. For many experts and organizers who spoke with Vox, that solidarity is as important now as it was back then. “When it comes to having policy influence and exercising political power, it is absolutely essential to have an Asian American movement. Each of these groups is too small, and there are similarities,” says Ramakrishnan. In the decades since it took off, the term is now mostly seen as a demographic marker. Today, it captures about 19 million people, up 81 percent since 2000, according to a recent Pew report — and a large immigrant population; 59 percent of all Asian Americans are immigrants, including 1.4 million of whom are undocumented. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in America, currently 5.6 percent of the county’s population but projected to be as much as 14 percent by 2065. Prior to becoming a more established category, though, issues of immigration — and, relatedly, xenophobia — have historically bound Asian Americans closely with one another, serving as a common thread for such an expansive group. We are “grounded in our history of exclusion laws and immigration bans,” emphasizes Ramakrishnan. “What makes us Asian is a history of exclusion.” That history goes as far back as 1882 when Chinese immigrants were barred from becoming citizens because they were seen as competition for white workers; in 1917, Indian people were similarly barred; and by 1924, Japanese and Korean people were barred as well. In all three cases, groups immigrated to the US as laborers and were framed as the source of economic problems, and in some cases public health ones, too. Members of ethnic groups that have more recently come to the country as refugees — including Hmong, Burmese, and Laotian people — have also faced restrictive immigration policies that have focused on deportation. “We share ... a continued history of being scapegoated for America’s ills — literally and figuratively — and never being accepted as full and equal members of society,” says Karen Umemoto, the director of the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA. In recent decades, combating such “othering” has fueled solidarity. One such instance was in 1982, when 27-year-old Vincent Chin was murdered by two white autoworkers who saw him as representing the increased competition the US was facing from Japanese manufacturers. Asian American-led protests erupted across the country and pushed the Justice Department to investigate the attack as a civil rights violation. Currently, in the wake of a surge in anti-Asian racism during the pandemic, attacks on older people, mass shootings in Atlanta that killed six women of Asian descent, and a mass shooting in Indianapolis that killed four Sikh Americans, there’s similarly been a renewed focus on pan-Asian solidarity and activism. “It has always been anti-Asian violence that brings people together,” says Espiritu. In recent months, thousands of people across the country have gathered for #StopAsianHate rallies in cities including Oakland, New York, and Philadelphia, and worked to raise awareness for nonprofits tracking hate incidents and offering support to local communities. Ramakrishnan hopes, too, that such efforts will be inclusive of different groups within the Asian diaspora moving forward. “Just as you have South Asian leaders who are showing up to denounce incidents predominantly affecting East Asians, you also need to have East Asians showing up for South Asians and Southeast Asians as well,” he says. There are the historical circumstances that bind Asian Americans together, and then there are the everyday experiences they share — many often driven by the “forever foreigner” stereotype. “No matter how much I wanted to be an American, other people wouldn’t see me as that,” says Daniel Shinwoo Kim, 26, a conservationist based in Tacoma, Washington. “Asian stereotypes, Asian anything, are just considered a joke. The most obvious is Asian men’s genitalia being smaller, people laugh at it.” The idea that people of Asian descent didn’t belong to the US, or were inherently foreign to this country, has fueled tropes like the fetishization of women, the emasculation of men, and insults about people’s accents, food, and appearance. “The hypersexualization that I faced, probably as young as [when] I was 6, changes how you consider sex and sexuality,” says Elim, 26, an organizer in Doraville, Georgia, who worked at her parents’ anime shop as a child and dealt with men constantly telling her how much they loved Asian women — and how exotic they found them. (Some full names have been omitted to protect people’s privacy.) “It made me question what it was like to be desired, and what it meant beyond being a sex object,” she says. Elim and others spoke, too, of being made to feel undesirable because of their identity. “There was often people mimicking the racist caricatures of Indian characters they see on TV or parroting comedy skits they see or the desirability or lack thereof of Indian American women, specifically,” says M., 22, a resident of Washington, DC. Related Combating the idea of being “foreigners” has often meant dealing with — and pushing back on — the pressure to conform as well. “In America, whiteness is your standardized identity. And that was amplified in the neighborhood I grew up in,” says Evan, 34, a government analyst in New York City. “It feels like you’re playing a role. You spend a lot of time thinking about how you come across to people. How are these white people going to judge me? In high school, I was always envious of people growing up in Asian enclaves in California or New York City. It just felt like an easier state of being.” “I think the first word I think of is ‘invisible.’ Aside from stereotypes of Asian women being very quiet, which I’ve, in my whole life, intentionally fought against, I have been thinking a lot about social situations where I just don’t have any social capital,” says Annie, 26, a graphic designer in New York City. “I have to compensate for that by presenting myself in a very loud way through what I wear or the way I speak. I’ve tried to walk more aggressively.” Such dynamics have led some Asian Americans to distance themselves from their identities when they were younger, and to embrace them more fully later in life. “To be completely candid, I’m more embracing of being Asian American now that I had been previously,” says Melina, 40, a massage therapist in Boston, who credits a trip to Myanmar, where her family emigrated from, as an experience that changed her outlook. “That feeling of being left out, of not belonging, is something that I internalized for a long time.” It is through some of this shared pain — along with a recognition of the specific hardships that different groups have faced — that Asian Americans, too, can find solidarity with one another. Among second-generation Asian Americans, there’s also a broad sense of the sacrifice that family members have made to come to the US in the first place. “Many of us had immigrant parents, and their focus was on surviving and making a life for themselves and their families,” says Jan Kang, 59, a tech executive, who spoke about how her father took a second job in the emergency room to pay for her college tuition. “I felt like my parents sacrificed a lot,” says Kang. In addition to grouping people of Asian descent under one racial category, the label expanded in the 1980s to include populations across the Pacific Ocean. The term AAPI, which includes Pacific Islanders, took off prominently among academics and was used in the 1990 census as government officials weighed how to count the group, who had previously been categorized in individual boxes like “Hawaiian,” “Guamanian,” and “Samoan.” “Pacific Islanders were too small of a group in the mind of key decision-makers to report separately,” says UCLA research professor Paul Ong, who added that the presence of Asian Americans in Hawaii may have been one of the reasons the two were initially put together. Scholars also began using the term to refer to experiences with colonialism that both Asian countries and Pacific Islanders had had. The idea was to “combine forces, given we were less than 3 percent of the US population in those days,” says Umemoto, who helped form a coalition of Asian American and Pacific Islander student groups along the West Coast. But many Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders argued this grouping erased their specific and current struggles. Although some Pacific Islanders are immigrants, many identify as Indigenous. Pacific Islanders as a group include Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Tokelauan, Tahitian, Tongan, Guamanian, Chamorro, Mariana Islander, Saipanese, Palauan, Yapese, Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Kosraean, Marshallese, I-Kiribati, Fijian, Papua New Guinean, Solomon Islander, and Ni-Vanuatu people. “Our race is deeply shaped by continued colonization and militarization, and they aren’t necessarily key issues for the Asian American community,” says Samuelu. ”For many Pacific Islanders, America happened without our consent.” The AAPI category also painted over inequities that existed, making it seem as though Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders were overrepresented at higher education institutions like other Asian Americans when the opposite was the case. When looking at degree attainment broken out by ethnicity, 62 percent of AAPI adults 24 and older have completed an associate’s degree or higher, compared to 28 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific islanders of the same age. In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget — which helps determine the categories used by the census — officially disaggregated the group in its data collection practices, though the label is still used by the media, academics, advocacy organizations, and some government institutions. During the pandemic, for instance, Pacific Islanders have pushed back against states’ decisions to group them together with Asian Americans, a move that’s made it tough to discern when Pacific Islanders have had much higher rates of coronavirus cases and fatalities. “Pacific Islanders always ask, ‘Are you just using us in name, or do you cover us in a meaningful fashion?’” says Ong. Sela Panapasa, a researcher at the University of Michigan who identifies as a Pacific Islander of Rotuman, Tongan, and Tuvalu descent, says that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders have long been invisible — something that lumping them into a larger category only exacerbated. “And who wants to be invisible, as a PI myself?” she says. It’s increasingly apparent that sweeping labels have serious problems. When it comes to the term “Asian American,” there’s a continual risk that it’s masking the differences within communities and fueling the myth that Asian Americans are a monolithic group. For some, there’s also the sense that East Asians, including groups that were part of some of the earlier waves of Asian immigrants such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans, are viewed as more synonymous with the term Asian than others. “It erases way too many people,” says Elim. “That’s bullshit. We’re not all the same.” Asian Americans comprise roughly 50 ethnic groups, who speak upward of 100 languages including Indian Americans, Chinese Americans, Taiwanese Americans, Filipino Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Pakistani Americans, Cambodian Americans, Hmong Americans, Thai Americans, Laotian Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, Burmese Americans, Nepalese Americans, Indonesian Americans, Sri Lankan Americans, Malaysian Americans, Bhutanese Americans, and Mongolian Americans — and that’s just some of the diversity that exists. There are also enormous generational, religious, class, and ideological differences among these groups, as well as huge economic disparities. According to a report from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, the income gaps among different Asian American ethnic groups are the widest of any racial group, and they are still growing. While Indian Americans have the highest median income of $100,000, for example, Burmese Americans have the lowest, at $36,000. Similarly, there are significant disparities among Asian Americans in educational attainment and health care outcomes: 94 percent of Japanese and Taiwanese Americans have graduated high school, compared to less than 66 percent of Laotian and Hmong Americans. And 22 percent of Nepalese Americans don’t have health insurance compared to 6 percent of Japanese Americans. “I think one of the biggest indicators is what did communities come to the US with. There is a big difference in the social, political, and literal capital that someone from China may have come from and refugees from Cambodia and Laos,” says Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. When policymakers simply group all Asian Americans together, none of these inequities are visible, meaning help often doesn’t get to the groups that need it most. “There has long been a problem of lumping all of the groups together, which makes Asian Americans look well-off by some measures when averaged out as a sociopolitical group,” says Umemoto. “But we’re a bifurcated community, with wide differences in well-being within and across ethnic groups.” The rise of the “model minority” stereotype, too, only added to the perception that all Asian Americans are broadly successful, camouflaging the struggles and diversity of many community members. And whether it’s representation in community organizations or the way the media talks about Asian Americans, many people don’t think the term is representative of the actual breadth of the Asian diaspora as a whole, either. “Something I’ve encountered a lot growing up is the erasure of South Asians as Asian. From a young age, folks would tell me, ‘Well, you’re Indian, that’s different from being Asian!’” says M. There’s a unique South Asian experience with “rising racism and Islamophobia” that should be acknowledged, M. says, referring to the surge in hate crimes and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of 9/11. “Bigotry toward our Muslim brothers and sisters translates to bigotry toward anyone brown.” For many, identifying based on their ethnicity also speaks more directly to their family ties and cultural heritage, compared to a more abstract marker like “Asian American.” “My felt identity, the one that I carry around in my body, is that ... I’m a third-generation Japanese American,” says University of Colorado ethnic studies professor Daryl Maeda. “There are vanishingly few people who would say they’re Asian American as a felt identity. I think it’s a political identity rather than a cultural one or a familial one.” This is further complicated by the fact that Asian American is an identity that’s often externally imposed because of how people are racialized in the US. When people of Asian descent have been targeted in America — both in recent attacks related to the coronavirus and historically — such racism is often directed at people of many Asian ethnicities. “We are all put in this same label even though for thousands of years we’ve fought wars against each other,” says Shinwoo Kim, 26. There’s a major need to recognize individual ethnic groups, and many advocates say this begins with data. Data disaggregation as a concept sounds complex, but in practice, it’s very straightforward: In addition to gathering data about Asian Americans as a large group, the government can also gather data by ethnic group and direct other major institutions to do the same. By doing so, policymakers would be able to better measure many of these disparities and appropriately target their responses. In the 2020 census, there is some disaggregation, though it’s not enough: The survey ultimately enables people to identify as Asian American and as other ethnic categories including Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, and “other.” Notably, a lot of groups are left out, including some who face the highest rates of poverty and unemployment among the Asian American diaspora, such as Cambodian, Hmong, and Bhutanese Americans. People of these backgrounds are still able to write in how they identify, which the census will report out as well. “Our ideal solution is that all 50-plus communities have checkboxes,” says Dinh, of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. The push for more disaggregation has extended to states, too. In Rhode Island, the All Students Count Act became law in 2017, requiring public schools to break out data on Asian American students by ethnicity — though activists are still fighting to make sure it’s fully implemented. In California, too, a 2016 law required the state’s public health department to disaggregate data, with the goal of providing better insurance coverage to groups that don’t have it, and to better understand how illnesses affect various groups differently. Disaggregated health data has played a role in revealing how diabetes disproportionately affects Filipino Americans and South Asian Americans, for instance. For Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, data disaggregation has been critical during the coronavirus pandemic as well. “In the aggregate, it looks like AAPI has the lowest rates of infection, but when you pull out PI, you see we’re twice as, four times as, six times as likely to get the infection,” says Samuelu. In the end, such disaggregation speaks to a larger issue about being seen. “As a young person who identifies as biracial — Khmer and Black — I always feel left out, particularly when filling out school forms, job applications, and internship opportunities,” Deijah Prak Preaster, an ARISE Youth Leader, said in a 2020 report. “I am always forced to check off the ‘other’ box for the question on ethnicity. The feeling of not being counted or seen hurts; it makes me feel my identity does not matter.” Currently, the #StopAsianHate movement has also been an inflection point for some Asian Americans to talk about their identity more openly and weigh such questions. “I think it’s an opportunity to talk about the ways we’re leveraged against each other, the way that East Asians have been used as a wedge and this shining example,” says Elim. “None of these communities are monolithic, and we perpetuate a lot of violence toward each other.” That effort is integral to attempts to strengthen Asian American solidarity, experts tell Vox. “I identify as Tamil, I identify as South Asian, I identify as Indian American, I identify as Asian American. It’s not an either/or for me,” says Ramakrishnan. “People are not just one thing,” echoes Espiritu. “I do identify as Asian American — it is a political identity — but I also identify as a Vietnamese refugee.” There are a lot of experiences that Asian Americans have in common — including a fight to be visible in American society and a focus on combating the systems reinforced by white supremacy. But achieving true unity may only be possible if people within it are willing to acknowledge not only similarities but differences in need. The label only works, Suong says, “if Asian Americans can look inward and say, ‘Look, let’s join together and support those who are most marginalized.’ If Asian America really took care of who’s vulnerable in Asian America, we’d have really strong solidarity.” Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

212,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/88nnq4/these-gun-sanctuary-states-want-to-destroy-bidens-gun-control-plans,"Texas is poised to become the 11th “Second Amendment Sanctuary” state in the U.S., joining a mushrooming movement of red states thumbing their noses at the prospect of Biden-backed gun control by declaring themselves legal safe havens for gun owners. Before President Joe Biden had even moved into the White House, anti-government extremists, militias, and right-wing politicians alike were stoking fears of a looming gun-grabbing campaign. Throughout his campaign, Biden repeatedly vowed to be an effective leader on gun control, and has called for the reinstatement of the assault weapons ban—the holy grail for gun control groups. Last month, on the heels of several mass shootings, he announced that he’d directed the Department of Justice to issue new guidance designed to curb untraceable ghost guns, and called on Congress to pass legislation to improve the background check system. Even though Biden’s actions have so far fallen short of his lofty campaign-trail promises, they set off alarm bells throughout red-state America. “Biden is threatening our 2nd Amendment rights,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote on Twitter. “He just announced a new liberal power grab to take away our guns. We will NOT allow this in TX. It’s time to get legislation making TX a 2nd Amendment Sanctuary State passed and to my desk for signing.” Texas’ “Second Amendment Sanctuary State Act” passed the House last week along party lines. If enacted, it would authorize withholding of state funds from any localities that try to assist with the enforcement of federal gun laws—including background checks, licensing programs, “red flag laws” and buy-back programs to get people to turn in their weapons. The bill also encourages Texans to file complaints with the state attorney general if they find evidence that their local governments are assisting with the enforcement of federal gun laws. The bill has a companion bill pending in the Senate that’s similar but doesn’t address some of the more specific gun laws like the House bill does. If it becomes law, it would make Texas the most extreme gun sanctuary state, because it appears tailored to block specific gun laws that have widespread public support—and are core to Biden’s agenda. In the month of April alone, six states—Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and West Virginia—became so-called gun sanctuaries. But the specifics of the bills range widely, from political grandstanding, to having the potential to trigger a nasty constitutional showdown. Nebraska and North Dakota passed “proclamations” which, ultimately, appear little more than symbolic gestures designed to give their governors an opportunity to flex their pro-gun credentials. The Montana law seems tailored to preempt a possible assault weapon ban, because it bars state and local law enforcement from enforcing any federal ban on ammunition or guns. Arizona’s new law prohibits localities from enforcing federal gun laws that are inconsistent with state gun laws. At least seven more states, including Texas, have meanwhile introduced legislation proposing Second Amendment sanctuary protections. Four states—Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, and Wyoming—passed gun protection laws during the Obama administration (Kansas wound up in a drawn-out legal battle over its law, which said local officials who enforced federal gun laws could be convicted of crimes). Symbolic or not, Giffords director of litigation Hannah Shearer says these laws will create confusion on a local level. “Either way, making it a state policy to not enforce federal gun laws is going to compromise public safety and leave state and local officials confused about what they are allowed to do to help with the enforcement of federal gun laws,” Shearer said. The surge in energy behind this movement comes from the confluence of anti-government rhetoric now dominating mainstream GOP politics, and strategizing around the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court, says Robert Spitzer, professor of political science at SUNY Cortland and author of “The Politics of Gun Control.” “It dovetails with the broader antagonism toward government that was fed during the Trump years and culminated with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol,” said Spitzer. “Even though just a handful of them carried guns, it was still a part of that larger movement that is still very much connected to guns.” In addition to the ideological, anti-government undercurrent driving this movement, there’s a longer game in play. “We have a Supreme Court that seems ever more receptive to expanding gun rights and knocking down gun laws,” said Spitzer. “That fuels the idea that gun laws are somehow against the Constitution, or the Second Amendment, which is not true.” The Second Amendment Sanctuary movement started in counties that were largely in conflict with Democratic-run state legislatures over guns. It began after the mass shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 but caught fire on a grassroots level during the Trump years, in the wake of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. The Parkland shooting created renewed impetus behind certain gun control measures, like “red flag laws,” which gave courts or cops an avenue to temporarily confiscate guns from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others. After Parkland, swaths of conservative counties in blue states began passing local ordinances giving their sheriffs the authority to block state gun laws they didn’t like. The movement co-opted language from the immigration sanctuary movement, wherein states or cities said they wouldn’t do the bidding of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration agenda and declared themselves sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. Hundreds of counties across at least 40 states now have some form of gun sanctuary status. The movement also borrowed language from the anti-government movement, which, together with a set of so-called “Constitutional Sheriffs,” have been firmly behind the notion of Second Amendment sanctuaries from the get-go. Now, with Trump gone and President Joe Biden in the White House, the dynamic of the Second Amendment Sanctuary movement has ramped up. Biden promised to usher in a new era of gun control for the U.S. Since he took office in January, and after several mass shootings, he’s directed the DOJ to issue new guidance designed to curb the proliferation of untraceable “ghost guns.” He’s also continued to call for the reinstatement of a federal law banning assault weapons like the AR-15. But while Biden’s actions so far have irked the gun world, his administration has not yet taken on the gun sanctuary movement, and it’s unclear whether it will in the future. “Just passing a resolution that sits as a symbolic thumbing the state’s nose at the federal government’s gun laws—they [the Biden administration] would probably be advised to leave it alone,” Spitzer said. “But if it has any material consequence, and it depends on what the consequence is, it might involve sending in federal law enforcement authorities. Perhaps in an extreme case, it could involve withholding of federal highway money, for example, if states don’t fall into line.” Spitzer noted that in 1984 Congress threatened to cut highway funding to states that weren’t enforcing the National Minimum Age Drinking Act, which raised the national driving age to 21. And Trump repeatedly threatened to withhold funding from states that had declared themselves immigration sanctuaries, including COVID-19 aid. Robert J. Cottrol, professor of law at George Washington University’s Law School, agreed it’s too early to know whether these state sanctuary laws put the U.S. on track for a constitutional crisis. As of now, Cottrol says, it appears that the sanctuary states aren’t overreaching. “You can’t forcibly deputize state and local police, and force them to enforce federal law as such. We saw that again with the immigration issue,” said Cottrol. “We potentially might see that again with the Second Amendment or gun issue, and the Biden administration.” “It’s quite one thing if state authorities are saying they won’t enforce a federal law and another if they’re saying they will actively resist and act against a federal law,” Cottrol added. The state-level sanctuary movement does offer even more of an obstacle to Biden’s gun agenda, though—in particular reinstating the assault weapon ban, which was law in the U.S. between 1994 and 2004. Not only is it unclear that the ban would muster enough support even among Democrats, but there are approximately 20 million assault rifles in circulation in the U.S. population. That, together with a slew of states declining to enforce such a ban, would make it very difficult to enforce.

        Clarissa-Jan Lim Last updated on May 6, 2021, at 8:22 p.m. ET Posted on May 5, 2021, at 3:03 p.m. ET Chui Fong Eng, an 85-year-old woman who was stabbed in the arm and chest Two older Asian American women waiting at a San Francisco bus stop on Tuesday afternoon were approached by a man with a knife and stabbed — the latest in a string of violent attacks on Asian Americans across the US. Police later arrested a suspect, a 55-year-old San Francisco resident. A spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the incident has not been ruled a hate crime but cautioned that the investigation is ongoing. One of the women stabbed is 85 and the other is in her sixties. They were taken to a hospital and were in stable condition as of Tuesday night, according to Matt Haney, a San Francisco district supervisor who said he was in touch with their families. Patricia Lee, a witness who was working at a nearby flower stand when the incident happened, told ABC7 that she saw the man stab one of the women. ""Her back was turned and all I see was the feathers coming out of her jacket, so I'm very sure that she got sliced,"" Lee said. On Thursday, the suspect, identified as Patrick Thompson, was charged with two counts each of premeditated attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and elder abuse. In announcing the charges, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office described the stabbings as ""a brutal attack"" and reiterated that investigators were still trying to determine if there was evidence to support hate crime charges. According to the district attorney's office, Thompson was last arrested in April 2020 for a missed court appearance. During court proceedings for separate cases in 2017, a judge found Thompson incompetent to stand trial and sent him to a state psychiatric hospital. He was released from custody in 2018 to participate in a mental health diversion program, which he complied with for nearly two years before the court granted a request for him to exit the program, the office said. ""Attacks on our [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community and especially on our elderly residents are horrifying, not just to the victims who suffer physical injury but to the entire AAPI community that has been living in fear,"" District Attorney Chesa Boudin said. ""We will hold those who commit these acts of violence and hate accountable."" The grandson of the 85-year-old woman, Drew Eng, identified her to BuzzFeed News as Chui Fong Eng. He declined to comment further, but in a GoFundMe raising money for medical expenses, Drew's sister Victoria said their grandmother was waiting at the bus stop to go home when she was ""stabbed with a long knife in her right arm and [that] entered into her chest."" ""These Asian hate crimes need to stop. Our hearts go out to all those who have been injured, killed, or affected by this wave of racist crimes toward the Asian community,"" Victoria said. ""San Francisco is my home and my Grandma’s home. We need to feel safe where we live and not in constant fear."" Haney, the district supervisor, called the attack part of a ""pattern."" ""This is happening to Asian people in our community specifically,"" he told ABC7. In recent months, there has been a slate of unprovoked and racist attacks against Asian people in several cities, sparking fear among Asian American communities. In March, six Asian women were killed in a mass shooting targeting spas in the Atlanta area, leading to an outpouring of grief and anger. Research from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino found that anti-Asian attacks in large US cities and counties increased by 164% in the first three months of 2021 compared to the same time last year. Another report from March also found an uptick of hate incidents against Asian Americans, though there is wide consensus that these numbers are undercounted because such incidents often go unreported. The stabbing in San Francisco is one of at least four attacks on Asian people in several cities this week alone. On Sunday, a man attacked two Asian women in their sixties as they were closing a Baltimore liquor store for the night. Graphic security footage shows him striking them in the head with the cinderblock as they try to fight him off. A GoFundMe created by the family identified the women as sisters, one of whom had 25 stitches on her head and black eyes as a result of the attack. ""Their physical wounds will heal eventually, but the trauma from this attack will require more time,"" the family said. In another case in San Francisco this week, an Asian man walking his toddler in a stroller was shoved to the ground by a stranger and beaten outside a grocery store. In New York City on Sunday, two Asian women were accosted by someone who yelled at them to remove their masks before hitting one on the head with a hammer.

215,https://nypost.com/2021/05/05/as-pandemic-ebbs-an-old-fear-is-new-again-mass-shootings/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Living By Associated Press Submit May 5, 2021 | 4:17pm				| Updated May 5, 2021 | 4:17pm PORTLAND, Ore.  — Brianne Smith was overjoyed to get an e-mail telling her to schedule a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Hours later, her relief was replaced by dread: a phone alert — another mass public shooting. Before the pandemic, she would scan for the nearest exit in public places and routinely practiced active shooter drills at the company where she works. But after a year at home in the pandemic, those anxieties had faded. Until now. “I haven’t been living in fear with COVID because I’m able to make educated decisions to keep myself safe,” says Smith, 21, who lives in St. Louis, Missouri. “But there’s no way I can make an educated decision about what to do to avoid a mass shooting. I’ve been at home for a year and I’m not as practiced at coping with that fear as I used to be.” After a year of pandemic lockdowns, public mass shootings are back. For many, the fear of contracting an invisible virus is suddenly compounded by the forgotten yet more familiar fear of getting caught in a random act of violence. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks mass killings — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — showed just two public mass shootings in 2020. Since Jan. 1, there have been at least 11. Yet while mass shootings dropped out of the headlines, the guns never went away. Instead, even as the U.S. inches toward a post-pandemic future, guns and gun violence feel more embedded in the American psyche than ever before. The fear and isolation of the past year have worked their way into every aspect of the U.S. conversation on firearms, from gun ownership to inner-city violence to the erosion of faith in common institutions meant to keep us safe. More gun owners, and different More than 21 million people completed a background check to buy a gun last year, shattering all previous records, and a survey found that 40% identified as new gun owners — many of whom belong to demographics not normally associated with firearms, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm industry trade association. Purchases of guns by Black Americans increased 58% over 2019 and sales to Hispanics went up 46%, the group says. Gun advocates tie this increase to pandemic anxiety and a loss of faith in the ability of police officers and government institutions at all levels to keep the public safe amid what at first was a little-understood, invisible menace. The eruption of sustained racial injustice protests after the police killing of George Floyd and calls to reduce police funding also contributed to more interest in firearms. One of those buyers was Charles Blain, a 31-year-old Black man in Houston who purchased a Glock 43 handgun and a shotgun for the first time last year. Blain, who describes himself as a conservative, says “pandemic-related unemployment crime” and repeated calls over the past year to release hundreds of jail inmates because of soaring COVID-19 infections pushed him to buy. “I was always gun-friendly, but never really felt the need to own one myself,” says Blain, who founded Urban Reform, which helps underserved communities get involved in policy decisions that impact them. The dramatic rise in firearms ownership represents a “tectonic shift in the conversation on guns,” says Mark Oliva, the foundation’s director of public affairs. “For these people, gun ownership and gun control was until now a rhetorical debate. It was something you could discuss at a cocktail hour, but they had no skin the game — and then they bought guns,” he says. “It’s hard to put today’s gun owner into a box,” Oliva added. Gun rights advocates feel good about what this could mean for gun policy, with a broader swath of society seeing themselves when they hear about gun control efforts. At the same time, gun-related homicides in midsized and big cities in America have skyrocketed during coronavirus, and criminologists believe the pandemic and the socioeconomic loss in many communities are factors driving that trend. A study by the Council on Criminal Justice tracked a 30% increase in homicides overall in a sample of 34 U.S. cities in 2020 as well as an 8% increase in gun assaults. “We’ve been trying to sound the alarm, but the No. 1 priority is COVID because nothing happens until COVID is fixed,” says Alex Piquero, a criminologist and professor at the University of Miami who conducted research for the Council on Criminal Justice’s COVID-19 commission. “This is the long-term symptom of the disease and … the long-term mental health effects of this are going to be staggering.” Portland, Oregon, a city of just over 650,000 people, is a stark example. Last year, there were more homicides than in any of the previous 26 years. This year, the city had tallied more than 340 shootings by late April — an average of about three a day — and was on track to blow past last year’s homicide record. The shootings are mostly impacting the city’s historically Black neighborhoods and lower-income areas where coronavirus has taken a heavy toll. In one instance, a Black pastor involved in a coalition to address the violence had to hurry off a Zoom meeting about the crisis because gunfire erupted nearby. In March, a 14-year-old boy was seriously wounded by gunfire while he stood with friends near a soccer field. “It’s the way that we all feel as people who have careers and homes and jobs and how emotionally unstable we’ve felt over this past year. Now imagine all that in people who are in hopeless situations,” says Sam Thompson, a Black resident who started a neighborhood group last summer to try to find solutions. More politics than ever When it comes to the gun control debate, Americans seem “more entrenched than ever,” and those divisions are playing out in state legislatures around the nation, says David Kopel, a law professor at the University of Denver and research director at the Independence Institute, a Libertarian think tank in Colorado that favors gun rights. After a year of isolation, loss and stress, the nation is akin to a patient in an acute mental health crisis — and there is a growing chasm of opinion on whether guns are part of the remedy, or a symptom of the disease. In conservative America, mask mandates and economic shutdowns have been lumped together with gun control legislation as examples of vast government overreach. Liberal legislatures, meanwhile, have moved to lessen gun access and tighten rules to prevent more mass shootings as a more heavily armed nation opens up. “When you’re getting told, ‘Look, the cops just can’t be there because they’ve all got COVID’ or, depending on the state, you may not be able to buy a gun because the licensing departments are getting overwhelmed — all those things came into play,” Kopel says. “You now have state (gun) laws that are directly pandemic-related.” In North Carolina, for example, lawmakers are considering a bill to remove a century-old requirement for a local sheriff’s permit to buy a pistol, a policy that came under scrutiny when one sheriff briefly stopped handling the paperwork because of COVID-19. In other conservative states, lawmakers have passed or are debating pandemic-inspired laws that do everything from strengthen a ban on using the government’s emergency powers to confiscate firearms to allowing gun owners to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. In Oregon, armed protesters angry that the state Capitol was closed to the public due to COVID-19 tried to storm the building late last year in a foreshadowing of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In response, Democrats are using their supermajority to advance a bill that would mandate safe storage for firearms and make it illegal to bring a gun into the state Capitol. In Colorado, a gun storage bill was recently signed into law and in Massachusetts, lawmakers are considering a ban on the manufacture of assault weapons in that state — a bill introduced after the recent spate of mass shootings. If recent months are any indication, for years to come the debate about guns will hold the echoes of our shared pandemic trauma and the seismic shifts it brought to our notions of safety, freedom and well-being. Yet in one area, some see the potential to reduce the polarization around guns: the increasing focus of public health in the national conversation. The idea that gun violence is a public health threat — just like the coronavirus and the pandemic it caused — could transform the way Americans talk about guns. “How can we learn to live with the guns, whereas right now we’re dying with them?” says David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University. “The public health approach in a one-sentence description is, ‘Let’s make it really easy to be healthy and really difficult to get sick and injured.’ We have to agree we have a big problem and it’s a societal problem. Then, there are so many things we can talk about.” Read Next 60 years after first American in space, tourists are linin... Share Selection This story has been shared 88,168 times.

RGR
, a leading gun manufacturer, reported a 50% spike in quarterly sales and more than doubled its profit, continuing its frenetic sales surge during the coronavirus pandemic. Sturm, Ruger, reported $183.60 million in net firearms sales for the quarter ended April 3, compared to $122.76 million in the year-ago quarter. The gunmaker also reported quarterly net income of $38.19 million, compared to $15.33 million in the year-ago quarter. “I could not be more proud of how well our folks rose to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and capitalized on the opportunities presented by the historic surge in demand during the past year,” said Chief Executive Officer Christopher J. Killoy, in a prepared statement. The company, in its 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, identified several reasons for the rise in demand, including the coronavirus pandemic, civil unrest, and the call from some politicians “for a reduction in funding and limitations on law enforcement activities.” This perception of lawlessness and anarchy has prompted many Americans to buy guns for self-protection. Sturm, Ruger, which is headquartered in Southport, Conn., said demand was also being driven by “concern about possible legislation that could curtail or limit gun ownership rights by both state and Federal governments.” The quarter was marked by accelerated gun sales industrywide during the administration of President Joseph Biden, a Democrat who plans to increase gun control measures, particularly versus assault weapons like the AR-556 produced by Sturm, Ruger. The specter of more restrictive gun control from the Biden administration has prompted many Americans to buy guns. “Stronger than expected revenue was driven by the continued surge in U.S. consumer demand for firearms,” said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry for Aegis Capital, in a Sturm, Ruger report for investors. “In the face of such strong demand and sharply increased order backlog compared to a year ago, the company has made significant strides in quickly increasing its production capacity to better meet such demand.” Sturm, Ruger, in its 10-Q filing, said that it was debt-free and “well-positioned to manage through this global crisis,” referring to the coronavirus pandemic. The company said it was providing cash incentives for employees to get vaccinated, and has provided extra paid time off while encouraging remote working when possible. Sturm, Ruger makes a variety of guns, including military-style rifles that gun control advocates and federal regulators call assault weapons, though the industry prefers to call them modern sporting rifles. Sturm, Ruger makes semiautomatic versions of these guns for civilian consumers, including the AR-556 pistol that was allegedly used by a gunman to kill 10 people at a Boulder, Colorado grocery store in March. This was just days after another gunman allegedly killed eight people, including six of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area. President Biden has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to assault weapons and high capacity magazines, which have been used in multiple mass shootings. “Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having a hundred rounds in a weapon,” said Biden, in his speech before Congress on April 28. “What do you think deer are wearing, Kevlar vests?” At a White House press conference in April, President Biden announced that was implementing executive orders restricting arm stabilizers like the one allegedly used with the AR-556 in the Colorado mass shooting, and to require background checks for ghost guns.

Richardson/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images) Biden also reiterated his long-standing plans to crack down on assault weapons. At the Rose Garden press conference, he also talked about bringing back the assault weapon ban that expired in 2004. This is a bit different from the detailed gun control plan he unveiled during the presidential campaign, which called for a ban on assault weapon sales to civilian consumers. Under the campaign plan, existing owners would have to register their assault weapons under the National Firearms Act, requiring a months-long background check process and a $200 tax, or sell them to the government as part of a nationwide gun buyback program. Either way, Biden has his sites set on assault weapons, which is helping to fuel gun sales for the short term, though this is based on the fear that the guns would eventually become unavailable. Assault weapons are also produced by Smith & Wesson, Sig Sauer, Daniel Defense, Springfield Armory, Diamond Back, Noveske, and many other gun makers including Franklin Armory, which recently bought the Bushmaster brand from Remington as part of its bankruptcy filing process. Gun sales have soared since the coronavirus pandemic swept through America in March 2020, flattening the economy and putting tens of millions of people out of work. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, background checks for gun purchases and other firearms-related actions totaled 15.96 million in the first four months of 2021. That’s a 26% increase from the same period in 2020, which was a record year for FBI background checks. Americans have been buying guns and ammunition amid outbreaks of civil unrest, including the Capitol riots of Jan. 6, reports of rising crime in New York, Chicago and other cities, and instances of police brutality versus Black Americans, including the conviction in April of ex-cop Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd. Americans are buying guns for self-protection, including the LCP line of compact semiautomatic pistols from Sturm, Ruger. These handguns are designed for concealed carry and are considered to be user-friendly for novice shooters. Compact handguns are also produced by Smith & Wesson, Glock, Taurus, Sig Sauer, and many others. The gun industry group the National Shooting Sports Foundation estimates that since the start of the pandemic, at least 8.4 million Americans have bought guns for the first time. This has fueled unprecedented demand for guns and ammunition, creating inventory shortages for guns and especially ammunition as manufacturers contend with supply chain disruptions and shortages of raw materials.

218,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/05/sole-survivor-from-orange-mass-shooting-leaves-hospital-mourns-deaths-of-her-children/,"Trending: The only survivor of a recent mass shooting in Orange was released from UCI Medical Center Wednesday, two bullets still lodged in her head, to heal at home and mourn the deaths of a son and daughter who were killed in the rampage. Blanca Ismeralda Tamayo is recovering from wounds sustained during the March 31 shooting at the real estate office where she worked, a killing spree that left four people dead. Among the victims: her 9-year-old son, Matthew Farias, and her 28-year-old daughter, Jenevieve Raygoza, herself a mother of two young children. After Tamayo exited the hospital, wearing a T-shirt in memory of Matthew, she clutched at her chest and wept when asked about the boy who reportedly died as she tried to shield him from the gunman. “He is an angel of God,” she said. In the days after the shooting, Tamayo’s survival also was very much in doubt. She spent days unconscious, her body functioning with the assistance of machines. Dr. Michael Lekawa, one of the UCI Health trauma surgeons who treated Tamayo, noted Wednesday that her wounds are difficult to survive. “This is a great outcome,” Lekawa said. “I think we can only expect to see more and more improvements as time goes on. I think she’s going to do very well.” “I think we will continue to see improvements for months,” he added. “When you’ve had this kind of injury, you really don’t know how you’re going to end up in the long term until you get six months to a year out.” Tamayo left the hospital wearing a protective helmet and bearing a scar on the right side of her face. She spoke little, mostly to thank medical staff, and avoided talking about the shooting that changed her life. Sometime after 5 p.m. on the afternoon of March 31, a gunman arrived at Unified Homes real estate office in Orange armed with a Glock semi-automatic handgun, ammunition, pepper spray and handcuffs, and opened fire. In addition to 9-year-old Matthew, those killed were the company’s owner, Luis Tovar, 50, as well as Raygoza, his daughter with Tamayo, and another employee at the office: Leticia Solis Guzman, 58, known as Letty. Tamayo, a Santa Ana resident, also worked at the real estate firm that specializes in mobile homes. That day, she had brought Matthew to the office. The man charged with the shootings is Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, 44, the husband or ex-husband of a former employee at the real estate firm. Court proceedings have been in limbo, though, as the suspect’s attorneys say Gonzalez — who was shot in the head by a police officer during a gun battle — has been unable to communicate with them. On Wednesday, Assistant Public Defender Ken Morrison told Orange County Superior Court Judge Cheri Pham that “As of today, he remains the same as he has for some time.” Authorities have not released additional details about the investigation, and have not discussed any suspected motive. Orange police, at the request of the Orange County District Attorney’s office, have decided against publicly releasing body camera footage and 911 calls related to the shooting. District Attorney Todd Spitzer asked that evidence be kept out of the public eye due to ongoing investigations into the killings and the officer involved shooting. On Wednesday, exactly five weeks since the shooting, Tamayo’s family focused on her recovery. Her sole surviving son, Louis Tovar – who lost his father, sister and little brother in the shooting – called it “a long five weeks.” “My mother gives me a lot of strength. And I know she’s going to need a lot of help the next coming months and years,” the Anaheim resident said. “If she can get through it, I have to get through it as well, for her and for my kids. I have no choice. I have to stay strong.” Tovar’s two young children were at the hospital Wednesday to welcome their grandmother with flowers. Family members said it marked the first time since the shooting that she had seen any of her four grandchildren. Matthew’s father, Rafael Farias, who Tamayo lives with, said “it’s a miracle she’s alive.” He added that he planned to do what he can to support her, but noted that Tamayo is uninsured and faces months of therapy and another surgery next month. The family has set up a GoFundMe account to help with her medical care. As Tamayo and Tovar addressed questions Wednesday outside of the hospital, Farias stood off to the side. He wore a small button emblazoned with Matthew’s face and the words: “In loving memory of our sweet boy.” Meanwhile, Tovar shared that he was gratified that his mother was leaving the hospital. “I’m happy to have her back on Mother’s Day, finally. I’m just happy to have her back.” But when asked what this Mother’s Day would be like for her, Tamayo only cried. Staff writer Sean Emery contributed to this report.

If the current trend continues, this could be the bloodiest summer in decades. CNN wants us to think white supremacists and their cursed AR-15s are shooting up our restaurants, playgrounds, and nightclubs. Let’s grab a shovel and dig up the facts. The U.S. saw a nearly 50% mega-jump in mass shootings last year over previous years: 2017: 347 shootings 2018: 336 shootings 2019: 417 shootings 2020: 610  shootings 2021 looks to dwarf 2020. March of 2020 spawned 25 mass shootings whereas in March of this year we had a whopping 45. If the lefty media is correct, “angry Trump-lovin’ white men” have been busy beavers. WHAT IS A MASS SHOOTING For this article I’m using the same definition used by the Gun Violence Archive: four or more people shot, not including the shooter, in a fluid situation. This can include drive-by shootings, gunfights between gangs, or two or more shooters redecorating a bar. WHO SHOT WHOM The race-obsessed liberal press has long pushed the belief that white guys in pickup trucks are cloaking themselves in Trump flags and mowing down former workmates with illegally purchased Terminator street-sweepers with optional bazookas. This wasn’t the case in March 2021 (nor in January or February for that matter), but you wouldn’t know it because the media has two serious serious rules when it comes to reporting mass shootings: if the person pumping lead is white or Muslim, run with it. If the gunman is black, you must hold back. We had 45 mass shootings in March. Sixty-six people were killed and 175 were injured. The deadliest shooting was in Boulder, Colo., where a Muslim male killed 10 and injured one. The shooting with the most victims was in Chicago, where two died and 13 were wounded. Illinois scattered mad brass with six mass shootings; Texans shot their way into 2nd place with five. California and Pennsylvania tied with four each. Whereas most of the shootings took place in larger cities (Chicago had five, Philly had three, Washington, D.C., Houston and Philly had two each), small towns had some perforations as well. Four out of Chamita, New Mexico’s, 870 residents took a bullet in a meth deal gone bad. It’s impossible to learn the identity of every shooter. Some will never be caught, much less ID’d in the news. Many of the shootings had more than one shooter. In Gresham, Ore., two shooters of different races worked together in multi-cultural harmony to blaze up a motel. The most popular venue to spread lead in March was at “pop-up” parties, which are illegal bashes that “pop up” in a place normally used for something else. Auto repair garage by day, illegal party venue/shooting range by night. There were two pop-up shootings in Chicago, one in Brooklyn and one in Philly. Of the 45 mass shootings, I was only able to positively ascertain the sex and race of the blazers in 20 shootings. Twelve of the shootings were committed by black gunmen and one by a black gunwoman. Five shootings were committed by Hispanic males. The shooting we heard the most about was the one white, male mass shooting in March. A man we won’t name wounded one person and killed 10 others in a “massage” spa in Acworth, Ga. Eight of the dead were Korean female sex workers, as well as one Hispanic male and one white male. The left bombarded us with the “angry white supremacist” narrative, even though the shooter stated that his crimes were sex, not race-related, and gently pointed out that he killed two people who weren’t Asian. CNN couldn’t accept that and doubled down on their big bad white supremacist theory. LIKELY SHOOTERS For some of the shootings, I have listed the “likely” race of the shooter. This is based largely on demographic city information and the race of known victims. Example: If eight people were shot in a neighborhood that is 93% black, all identified victims are black (and no MAGA hats are recovered), it would strongly suggest the shooter is black. Also, if a white guy shot eight black people, Don Lemon would be unable to contain his glee and you’d hear about it—again and again and again,… FINAL SHOOTING STATS 30.5 black or likely black shootings (67.7%) 7.5 Hispanic or likely Hispanic shootings (16.6%) 2 white or likely white shootings (4.4%) 1 Muslim (2.2%) 4  too little info to make a call (8.8%) (Reminder: one shooting had two shooters, one black and one Hispanic) Mass shootings in March don’t fit the liberal narrative, but Rachel Maddow is still pushing it, hoping for it to be true. Soon. Hopefully next month Rach. (Sources: Gun Violence Archive, Legacy.com, and HeyJackass. Demographic information on neighborhoods comes from multiple sources.)

220,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/national-day-prayer-inspires-pleas-unity-justice-77524153,"U.S. soldiers were fighting in Korea when President Harry Truman signed a congressional resolution calling for an annual National Day of Prayer U.S. soldiers were fighting in Korea when President Harry S. Truman signed a congressional resolution calling for an annual National Day of Prayer. The purpose was for people to gather in houses of worship to pray for world peace, according to an Associated Press report from April 17, 1952. Since 1988 the event has taken place on the first Thursday in May, diligently observed by some churches, ignored by others. The 70th edition this week comes after a year wracked by a devastating pandemic, political polarization and turmoil related to racial injustice. President Joe Biden, in a         proclamation  declaring Thursday to be the National Day of Prayer, said prayers could help America overcome these adversities. “As we continue to confront the crises and challenges of our time — from a deadly pandemic, to the loss of lives and livelihoods in its wake, to a reckoning on racial justice, to the existential threat of climate change — Americans of faith can call upon the power of prayer to provide hope and uplift us for the work ahead,"" he said. Several faith leaders spoke to the AP about lessons learned from the recent challenges and about their prayers for the days ahead. The Rev. Jacqui Lewis, whose Middle Collegiate Church in New York City was gutted by fire Dec. 5, said she’ll share a prayer for the nation and the world with her multicultural congregation that goes beyond denominations and religion, what she called “a prayer to love, for love.” She’s inviting people to pray for an end to the pandemic as well as the rebuilding of her historic church in lower Manhattan. Lewis called it “a powerful symbol that the nation would pray on the same day at the same time.” Yet she said that despite the day's nonpartisan nature, “it hasn’t felt free of partisan politics in the last few years."" Citing the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol as a low point, Lewis said, “My prayer is that we can bounce from that place to a place where the nation’s children belong to all of us ... where policing and safe communities are issues that belong to all of us. That disrupting racism belongs to all of us. An economy in which everyone can eat and be well and safe and have housing.” In Brazoria, Texas, about 50 miles southwest of Houston, John Elkins said he and most of his congregation at Sovereign Grace Fellowship pray daily, which colors his view of the National Day of Prayer. “It’s when the rest of the nation gets on board with what we’re already doing,” the Southern Baptist pastor said. “We get excited. But we know that on Friday, much of the nation isn’t going to be praying.” As for his own prayers, Elkins said a central aspiration is that people “begin to interact with each other with a love for humanity.” “What we saw in the last year was a lack of people looking at their neighbors as human and a lot more of looking at their neighbors as though they were in competition or they were the enemy,” he said. “We have seen the divisions manifest and multiply — people grabbing hold of things that were not true, or that they wish were true, and clinging to those things.” Political divisiveness also was on the mind of Bishop Paul Egensteiner, who oversees 190 churches in the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. “We need to pray for unity and the ability to come together around those things that matter,” he said. “After the year we’ve been through, praying for more commitment to that would be a worthy effort.” Egensteiner lamented that even the pandemic and vaccinations are potential fodder for political differences and called for people to rediscover that “what binds us together is stronger and more important than what drives us apart.” Also in his thoughts: the vital, often-overlooked duties performed by front-line workers: from hospital employees to people delivering groceries. “We realize how much we need them,"" Egensteiner said. ""We need to show them our appreciation and care.” The Rev. David Fleming of Our Savior Lutheran Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said much of his prayers and ministry for the past year have focused on older, homebound parishioners, and on fellow pastors nationwide. The executive director for spiritual care with Doxology, a denomination-wide program providing spiritual care and counseling for clergy, Fleming said that during the pandemic about 280 pastors participated in socially distanced in-person retreats and dozens more received counseling by telephone. “The pastors have done an incredible job — they’ve been available 24/7,” Fleming said. “The biggest problem: They work super-hard and they get wiped out.” “You can’t work that hard week after week after week,” he added. “At some point you’ve got to take some rest.” The interfaith group Religions for Peace USA has organized a national, virtual service reflecting on racism, as the country grapples with questions of racial injustice. It’s “looking at the original sin of our country, which is racism,” executive director Tarunjit Singh Butalia said, pointing to last month’s mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse where a former employee killed eight people including four members of Indianapolis' Sikh community. As a Sikh, Butalia said he hopes the Day of Prayer can also follow in his faith’s view of “chardi kala,” which the Sikh Coalition defines as “resilience and boundless optimism, even in the face of adversity.” “The National Day of Prayer is symbolic,"" Butalia said, ""but it represents a higher commitment for all of us.” Zahid Bukhari, who will deliver the closing prayer for the interfaith service, said people need divine guidance more than ever amid the global coronavirus crisis. The Day of Prayer also offers a chance to reflect on other issues such as “why the systemic racism, discrimination, poverty, hunger, inequality, hate and police brutality still exist in our societies,” said Bukhari, the executive director of the ICNA Council for Social Justice, a Muslim advocacy group. He noted with delight that year it falls during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, worship, charity and contemplation. “It is a wonderful coincidence,” Bukhari said. “Ramadan is the month for reconnecting with God and sharing the blessings of God with other human beings.” ——— Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S. The AP is solely responsible for this content. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-06 00:04:46,National Day of Prayer inspires pleas for unity and justice,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

227,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/06/sole-survivor-from-orange-mass-shooting-leaves-hospital-mourns-deaths-of-her-children/,"Trending: The only survivor of a recent mass shooting in Orange was released from UCI Medical Center Wednesday, two bullets still lodged in her head, to heal at home and mourn the deaths of a son and daughter who were killed in the rampage. Blanca Ismeralda Tamayo is recovering from wounds sustained during the March 31 shooting at the real estate office where she worked, a killing spree that left four people dead. Among the victims: her 9-year-old son, Matthew Farias, and her 28-year-old daughter, Jenevieve Raygoza, herself a mother of two young children. After Tamayo exited the hospital, wearing a T-shirt in memory of Matthew, she clutched at her chest and wept when asked about the boy who reportedly died as she tried to shield him from the gunman. “He is an angel of God,” she said. In the days after the shooting, Tamayo’s survival also was very much in doubt. She spent days unconscious, her body functioning with the assistance of machines. Dr. Michael Lekawa, one of the UCI Health trauma surgeons who treated Tamayo, noted Wednesday that her wounds are difficult to survive. “This is a great outcome,” Lekawa said. “I think we can only expect to see more and more improvements as time goes on. I think she’s going to do very well.” “I think we will continue to see improvements for months,” he added. “When you’ve had this kind of injury, you really don’t know how you’re going to end up in the long term until you get six months to a year out.” Tamayo left the hospital wearing a protective helmet and bearing a scar on the right side of her face. She spoke little, mostly to thank medical staff, and avoided talking about the shooting that changed her life. Sometime after 5 p.m. on the afternoon of March 31, a gunman arrived at Unified Homes real estate office in Orange armed with a Glock semi-automatic handgun, ammunition, pepper spray and handcuffs, and opened fire. In addition to 9-year-old Matthew, those killed were the company’s owner, Luis Tovar, 50, as well as Raygoza, his daughter with Tamayo, and another employee at the office: Leticia Solis Guzman, 58, known as Letty. Tamayo, a Santa Ana resident, also worked at the real estate firm that specializes in mobile homes. That day, she had brought Matthew to the office. The man charged with the shootings is Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, 44, the husband or ex-husband of a former employee at the real estate firm. Court proceedings have been in limbo, though, as the suspect’s attorneys say Gonzalez — who was shot in the head by a police officer during a gun battle — has been unable to communicate with them. On Wednesday, Assistant Public Defender Ken Morrison told Orange County Superior Court Judge Cheri Pham that “As of today, he remains the same as he has for some time.” Authorities have not released additional details about the investigation, and have not discussed any suspected motive. Orange police, at the request of the Orange County District Attorney’s office, have decided against publicly releasing body camera footage and 911 calls related to the shooting. District Attorney Todd Spitzer asked that evidence be kept out of the public eye due to ongoing investigations into the killings and the officer involved shooting. On Wednesday, exactly five weeks since the shooting, Tamayo’s family focused on her recovery. Her sole surviving son, Louis Tovar – who lost his father, sister and little brother in the shooting – called it “a long five weeks.” “My mother gives me a lot of strength. And I know she’s going to need a lot of help the next coming months and years,” the Anaheim resident said. “If she can get through it, I have to get through it as well, for her and for my kids. I have no choice. I have to stay strong.” Tovar’s two young children were at the hospital Wednesday to welcome their grandmother with flowers. Family members said it marked the first time since the shooting that she had seen any of her four grandchildren. Matthew’s father, Rafael Farias, who Tamayo lives with, said “it’s a miracle she’s alive.” He added that he planned to do what he can to support her, but noted that Tamayo is uninsured and faces months of therapy and another surgery next month. The family has set up a GoFundMe account to help with her medical care. As Tamayo and Tovar addressed questions Wednesday outside of the hospital, Farias stood off to the side. He wore a small button emblazoned with Matthew’s face and the words: “In loving memory of our sweet boy.” Meanwhile, Tovar shared that he was gratified that his mother was leaving the hospital. “I’m happy to have her back on Mother’s Day, finally. I’m just happy to have her back.” But when asked what this Mother’s Day would be like for her, Tamayo only cried. Staff writer Sean Emery contributed to this report.

My head has never been on a pike. It’s difficult these days to be an unabashed fan of the United States Constitution, what with it being under assault by so many who swore to uphold it. Welcome to Joe Biden’s America, and say goodbye to every freedom you held dear. I really wish I were being over the top about this, but I read and stuff. This asterisked occupier administration continually exhibits a disdain for all of the freedom parts of the Constitution. They like the part where they can tax you to death but they hate almost everything else. Because they’re full-on fascists, they harbor an extraordinary amount of animosity for the 2nd Amendment. Totalitarians fear a citizenry that can fight back, so they have a relentless focus on making sure that doesn’t happen. Grandpa Gropes began his highly questionable occupation of the Oval Office with a host of promises to the left-of-left fringe that is now the Democratic Party. The puppet president has been clear from the beginning that he wants to take away the right of American citizens to defend themselves. Anti-gun Democrats have always faced two problems: the 2nd Amendment and the fact that most Democrats in flyover country are gun owners. Their legislative efforts to thwart the right of the people to defend themselves fail miserably because the people have an annoying penchant for wanting to defend themselves. Being the ever-inventive totalitarian control freaks they are, the Democrats are forever seeking new ways to take away your gun rights. The new frontier for the next-gen Soviets is going after the ammunition market. Bryan took a look yesterday at the ammo shortage in America. The frightening governmental overreach during the Wuhan Chinese Bat Flu pandemic has created a boom market for firearms. I’ve almost lost count of how many people I know who bought their first gun in the last year. Market forces would naturally make ammo supply a problem. As Bryan notes in his post, it’s getting kind of expensive out there. As a resident of the freest gun state in America, I never had a problem getting ammo. I got mine at my local Ace Hardware. A couple of months ago, they ran out completely. I had to make my first foray into the online ammo market and my wallet immediately began to ache. Our sister site Bearing Arms has been covering the backdoor push to assault the 2nd Amendment via ammo control. Thankfully, as my Bearing Arms colleague Tom Knighton wrote, it’s not going to be that easy. It doesn’t mean they won’t stop trying though. The anti-2A people will go after ammo, magazines, and anything else having to do with owning or firing a gun. I wouldn’t be surprised if they went for a holster ban one day. Two things are certain for gun owners: they’re coming after us and they’re going to keep being creative about ways to do it.

number of politically motivated criminal cases in 2020, Interior Minister Horst
Seehofer said on Tuesday. The number of such crimes has increased by 8.5%
in the past year -- to just under 45,000, he said at a news conference in
Berlin. That is a new high, said Seehofer, calling the latest figures
""very worrying."" Tellingly, according to Far Right Extremism
in Europe report of January 2021, Europe faces a growing threat of far-right
terrorism. But the movements are not confined by borders or seaboards, instead,
""the modern far-right is currently undergoing a broader and more
fundamental shift"" the report says, ""the emergence of a transnational
and post-organizational threat."" Building on recent trends internationally,
and following in the footsteps of the hyper-polarization of politics in the
United States, far right-terrorism continues to pose a threat in Europe,
according to the State of Hate report. More than
100 pages report pointed out that 2020 saw the European far-right become
extremely animated in response to the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that
took place across the continent and existing racial nationalist activists and
organizations, already preoccupied with the concept of race, have used the
Black Lives Matter protests to push their existing political platform to a
wider audience. Some
elements of the far-right that have traditionally distanced themselves from
open racial politics, promoting instead 'cultural nationalism', have become
more willing and open to explicitly racial politics in response to Black Lives
Matter protests. Whether this shift is permanent will remain to be seen but in
the short-to-medium term we have seen cultural nationalism cede ground to
racial nationalism within parts of the European far-right. The report cited far-right events, such as
the mass shooting in Hanau, Germany, at two Shisha bars that claimed nine
lives, to the re-election victory of far-right leader Andrzej Duda in Poland
taking place in 2020. A large number of arrests and activity online related to
terrorism and violence existed as well in the past year, the report says, which
surveyed more than 11,000 people across eight European countries, with networks
of individuals perpetuating acts of violence spreading internationally. An international far-right Under the
title of ""an international far-right"" the Report said: ""While it
remains important to explore trends in traditional far right organisations such
as political parties, the modern far-right is currently undergoing a broader
and more fundamental shift; namely the emergence of a transnational and
post-organisational threat. The European far-right scene today is a mixture of
formalised far-right political parties, such as the Sweden Democrats, Vox in
Spain, Lega in Italy and the AfD in
Germany, and a series of looser, transnational far-right movements comprised of
a disparate array of individuals collectively but not formally collaborating. ""In the age
of the internet we have seen the emergence of disparate movements such as the
anti-Muslim 'counter-jihad' movement and the international alt-right. While all
these groupings have formal organisations within them, they are often
post-organisational. Thousands of individuals, all over the world, offer
micro-donations of time and sometimes money to collaborate towards common
political goals, completely outside traditional organisational structures. ""Now, from
the comfort and safety of their own homes, far-right activists can engage in
politics by watching YouTube videos, visiting far right websites, networking on
forums, speaking on voice chat services like Discord and trying to convert
'normies' on mainstream social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. The
fact that this can all be done anonymously greatly lowers the social cost of
activism. ""These new
movements are best understood as a many-headed hydra. If one prominent activist
or leader falls from grace, it is no longer a fatal hammer blow; others will
simply emerge and the besmirched are discarded. Of fundamental importance is
that these movements are genuinely transnational. While activists will
generally be primarily preoccupied with local or national issues, they
invariably contextualise them continentally or even globally. ""Often
activists from all over the world come together for short periods to
collaborate on certain issues and these loose networks act as synapses passing
information around the globe. An Islamophobe in one country outraged by the
serving of halal chicken in their local fast-food restaurant can post on social
media and the story will spread through the network. If picked up by a
'supersharer' (an especially influential activist with a large social media
following) that local story will be picked up by likeminded Islamophobes all
over the world and act as more 'evidence' and further convince them of the
threat of 'Islamification'. ""If we are
to truly understand the contemporary far right, we must therefore change our
thinking. We live in a shrinking world: be it in our own community, our own
country, continent or globe, we are interconnected like never before. ""The tools
at our disposal to build a better, fairer, more united and collaborative world
are also in the hands of those who are using them to sow division and hatred
around the world. If we want to understand the dangers posed by the politics of
hatred and division we can no longer just look at our street, our community or
even our country, we must think beyond political parties, formal organizations
and even national borders."" Next Page  1   |  2 (Note: You can view every article as one long page if you sign up as an Advocate Member, or higher).  Rate It |

          / CBS News Washington — The House will take up a bill aimed at addressing hate crimes against Asian Americans later this month, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced on Thursday. The Senate passed the legislation by an overwhelming and bipartisan majority last month. The legislation would supplement the federal government's efforts to address the recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic, establish a point person at the Justice Department who would quickly review hate crime incidents and provide more guidance to state and local entities to make it easier to report hate crimes. The bill would also expand public education campaigns designed to increase awareness and outreach to victims. The proposal comes amid a dramatic rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. The organization Stop AAPI Hate said Thursday that it had received a total of 6,603 reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and March 31, 2021. The data showed that 64.8% of all hate incidents reported came from Asian American women. The House vote, set for the week of May 17, also comes after a mass shooting in March that killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, in the Atlanta area. The bill, which was approved by a vote of 94 to 1 in the Senate, garnered support from Republicans after a round of negotiations last month. The Senate-passed legislation includes language that stripped tying anti-Asian hate crimes to COVID-19, but still makes explicit that it refers to the AAPI community. The bill also includes language from the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, which would allow the attorney general to issue grants to state and local governments to assist them with reporting hate crimes. Hoyer said the House will also take up a resolution introduced by Congressional Asian Pacific Heritage Caucus Chair Judy Chu condemning the Georgia shootings. The House also plans to vote this month on bills for mental health grants, protecting against predatory lending, and providing STEM fellowships for underserved communities. Hoyer said that the House may consider a supplemental appropriation bill ""to address enhanced security needs for the Capitol complex"" and establish a commission to investigate the attack at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, if the legislation is ready.

233,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/05/06/boulder-police-officer-cleared-king-soopers-shooting/,"Trending: The Boulder police officer who shot the King Soopers mass-shooting suspect in the leg during the attack was cleared of any wrongdoing Thursday by Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty. Officer Richard Steidell was among the second group of officers to go into the Boulder grocery store during the mass shooting on March 22, entering through the front doors at about 2:38 p.m., about eight minutes after the attack started, according to Dougherty’s decision letter. Steidell and the officers with him were fired upon within about 20 seconds of entering the store, according to the letter, and the rounds “passed directly over the heads” of Stiedell and two other officers. One officer was struck by shattering glass. Steidell dove to the ground and fired at shooting suspect Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, who police say was holding a long gun. Alissa moved out of the officer’s line of sight, and then back into it about 90 seconds later, raising the long gun and pointing it down an aisle at the officers, according to the letter. Steidell fired again, then retreated out of the store. The officer fired a total of eight times, striking Alissa once in the leg. Alissa was taken into custody about an hour after the attack began. He did not shoot his gun again after being shot in the leg, Dougherty said in the decision letter. “Officer Steidell’s shots were the last ones fired by anyone inside King Soopers on March 22,” Dougherty wrote. Steidell was placed on leave pending the district attorney’s investigation. Dougherty found that the officer was justified in using deadly force. “There is absolutely no question that Officer Steidell was justified in firing his weapon at Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa,” he wrote. Ten people were killed in the attack, including a Boulder police officer. Those killed in the attack were: Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Teri Leiker, 51; Officer Eric Talley, 51; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65.

234,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/doctor-lawyer-insurrectionist-the-radicalization-of-simone-gold/," Stephanie MencimerMay 6, 2021 When rioters broke into the US Capitol on January 6, chants of “Fuck the police!” “USA!” or “Treason!” echoed in the marble halls. When Dr. Simone Gold got inside the rotunda, she stepped over a velvet rope and announced to anyone who would listen, “I am a Stanford-educated attorney!” Thus she distinguished herself among the motley crew of Proud Boys, MAGA types, and the QAnon shaman who paraded through the Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an event that left five people dead. Not only is Gold a Stanford-educated lawyer, she’s also a board-certified emergency room physician. Neither qualification prevented the FBI from coming to her Beverly Hills house on January 18 and arresting her. Nor did it make a federal grand jury think twice in early February before indicting her on five criminal counts, including entering a restricted building and obstructing an official proceeding. The arrest marked the end of one chapter in her Icarian trajectory into right-wing fame. Before April 2020, Gold had been just another over-achieving Beverly Hills doctor. But with the arrival of the pandemic, she donned her white lab coat to protest lockdowns and promote President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID treatment, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. It seems that’s all it took to find an enthusiastic audience among the MAGA faithful, putting her on a glide path to a certain kind of right-wing stardom. Conservatives who love to bash educated, liberal elites as out of touch quickly embraced Gold and gleefully touted her impressive credentials to support their attacks on public health measures designed to combat the pandemic. She sailed into their well-funded ecosystem, snagging speaking gigs, appearances on cable talk shows, and robust opportunities to fundraise. Simone Gold, with John Strand (left) uses a bullhorn to address protesters in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Within days of her first media hit, she had teamed up with tea party groups working with the Trump reelection campaign to demand that governors reopen the economy. Fox News put her on national TV to publicly denounce lockdowns and mask mandates as overblown responses to a disease she insisted wasn’t fatal to most people. In July, her new right-wing friends ushered her to meetings with members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence. The sudden fame seems to have propelled her right up the steps and into the Capitol on January 6. Her arrest highlights the role of conservative media in fomenting an insurrection, but Gold’s personal experience also illustrates what experts on extremism have long known: Education is no defense against radicalization. “If you think of who is susceptible of extremist ideology, people tend to think it’s people who don’t have much education,” says Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas political science professor who has studied extremism and radicalization. “That’s not the case at all. It tends to be more middle class and upper class. Those who have spent more time educating themselves tend to think they know better than other people.” In fact, much like the tea partiers of the Obama era, the Capitol insurrectionists were by and large an aging, middle-class mob. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago have dug into the demographic profiles of hundreds of people charged with crimes related to the Capitol incursion. They’ve found that about 30 percent of the arrested rioters are white-collar professionals like Gold. Only about 13 percent were affiliated with traditional far-right militias or extremist groups like the Proud Boys, and only 7 percent were unemployed. Even so, Gold still stands out from that well-heeled crowd, and not just because she’s a woman. (Women make up only about 15 percent of the Capitol defendants.) Of the more than 420 defendants the Chicago researchers studied, she is one of only two lawyers and the only doctor. That’s why it’s hard not to look at Gold’s CV and wonder: How does someone go from medical school to Stanford Law School to an FBI wanted poster? Gold’s resume doesn’t scream budding far-right revolutionary as much as it reflects unusual precocity and ambition. Raised in a wealthy section of Long Island, New York, Gold, 55, likes to say that she trained as a physician at her father’s knee. Reuben Tizes, her father, was a doctor, a medical school professor, and even served as the Orange County, New York, health commissioner in the early 1970s. Her mother, Carol Tizes, was an elementary school teacher. After graduating from the City College of New York at 19, she claims she was the youngest person in her graduating class at the Chicago Medical School in 1989. She obtained a California medical license in 1990 but then enrolled in Stanford Law School, graduating in 1993. “That was my idea of rebellion,” she told a religious broadcaster in August, explaining that her father had wanted all his children to be doctors. (They are.) Her legal prowess didn’t stand out much in Palo Alto, however. I reached out to a host of her Stanford Law classmates, but none of those who responded could recall much about Gold aside from her red hair. Stanford Law School class photo The intervening decades between law school and her indictment were unconventional only in the ambition of her professional endeavors. In January 1997, she was admitted to the New York bar and then completed a residency in emergency medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. That same year, according to her LinkedIn profile, she served as a congressional fellow in DC and wrote speeches for the late Vermont senator James Jeffords, who famously left the Republican Party to become an Independent in 2001. (Susan Boardman Russ, who served as Jeffords’ chief of staff for 25 years before retiring in 2004, does not remember Gold.) Over the past three decades, Gold has practiced emergency medicine at various hospitals in the LA area, but the lure of Washington seems to have endured. According to her LinkedIn page, in 2009, she worked in DC as an assistant to Michael Oren, then Israel’s ambassador to the US, who credited her in print for stories she helped him research for the Wall Street Journal and New Republic. Oren told Mother Jones that he had no memory of her working for him, nor did anyone on his staff. In Los Angeles, Gold married businessman Larry Gold and had two children. Active in the Los Angeles Jewish community, she and her husband once provided a glowing testimonial for a local mohel for the bris he performed for their son. A 2003 Jewish Journal article featured Gold and her then two-year-old son in a story about “Shalom Time” at a local bookstore. She and her husband donated thousands of dollars to their children’s private, conservative Jewish day school in Beverly Hills, where Gold volunteered on the PTA, managing the shabbat swap one year. But by 2010, Gold had filed for divorce. Los Angeles County court records suggest that her relationship with her ex-husband was somewhat contentious. In 2017, a judge ordered them to attend mediation over child custody and visitation issues. (Larry Gold declined to comment for this story other than to say that he was “shocked” to learn about his ex-wife’s participation in the events at the Capitol.) In her October 2020 book I Do Not Consent: My Fight Against Medical Cancel Culture Gold writes, “I have always worked with the poor and underserved,” treating ER patients in places like Inglewood, California, which she describes as a “low-income, gang-ridden majority-minority city that provided the setting for the tough 1991 drama Boyz N the Hood.” She does not, however, include any mention of her services as a pricey “concierge physician,” which she advertised on her now-defunct personal website: “As a C-Suite Physician, Dr. Gold works the same way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO…all with an eye toward fixing her client’s exact problem.” Gold charged $5,000 for an initial appointment and between $25,000 and $50,000 for ongoing consultations. The concierge medical practice is just one of several business enterprises she attempted to launch over the years—including MedicaLife, a short-lived lifestyle magazine for doctors that launched in 2006 and folded in 2008. (“Confessions of a Hospital Fundraiser,” teased one cover mockup.) In 2017, Gold started a company called Gold Healthcare Solutions that advertises assistance to hospitals facing government audits. Until recently, the company website listed as CEO the venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who’s married to the actress Sela Ward and who ran in the Mississippi Democratic primary for the US Senate in 2018. When I asked Sherman about his role at the company, he replied in an email: “I have ZERO relationship with Dr. Simone Gold’s company. I work in the medical device world and at one time she approached me with an idea she had that I vetted with some of my contacts. I was not able to achieve the kind of interest she wanted so we stopped talking about the project.” His name and photo were subsequently removed from the company website. Lots of people flame out in business, get divorced, and don’t end up storming the Capitol. But Haider-Markel says that those who do become radicalized are searching for broader meaning in their lives or a sense of identity. “Oftentimes there is a precipitating event. They lose a partner. They have a financial crisis,” he says. “They develop some grievance around that and connect that to a broader social movement.” If Gold was looking for a mid-life reboot, the heady mix of the pandemic, President Trump, and right-wing media provided the perfect catalyst. The moment that “changed my life completely,” she told a California KGET TV reporter in January, took place in April 2020. She had been treating COVID patients in Los Angeles emergency rooms with President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID cure, hydroxychloroquine, just a few weeks after the president had announced that the FDA would be fast-tracking emergency use authorization for the drug for COVID treatment. Trump called it “a game changer,” despite warnings from the FDA that the anti-malaria drug may cause heart rhythm problems in some people. Gold was enthusiastic about the drug’s treatment possibilities. In her book, she describes how, after extensive research, she had used hydroxychloroquine to cure a woman suffering from mild COVID. “I had expected to get kudos,” she writes. “Instead I was met with hostility.” The hospital medical director challenged her independence and dressed her down for prescribing a drug that wasn’t indicated for outpatients. Gold argued she had science to back her up, and cited the drug’s long safety profile. Unpersuaded, the medical director threatened to fire her if she ever prescribed the drug to an outpatient again. For most of her life, Gold doesn’t seem to have been politically active. She donated $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) in 2019, but before that, the only other federal candidate to whom she gave money was a Democrat—California Rep. Raul Ruiz—in 2011. “I have never considered myself a political person. I’ve supported both parties at various times in my life,” she says in her book. “I’d fall in the middle of any partisan test. I don’t believe in the right-left distinction…That’s the trouble with being in the middle of the road. Sometimes you get run over.” But after the hospital threatened to fire her over her prescribing practices, Gold picked a lane. On April 14, she called Dennis Prager’s radio show. Prager has been broadcasting in LA since 1982, but he has become an important though underappreciated part of the modern right-wing infrastructure thanks to his online Prager University. Popular with young people and the alt-right, Prager U publishes five-minute tutorials on everything from climate change to economics. The videos are designed to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” (A sampling: “The Dangers of Islam” and “Just Say Merry Christmas.”) Identifying herself as an ER doctor, Gold described her success at treating patients with hydroxychloroquine and voiced dismay that medicine was becoming so politicized that a perfectly safe drug could not be dispensed by doctors without controversy. “The science has taken a backseat to the hatred of the president,” Prager commiserated. A week later, Gold made a series of Twitter videos, a platform that she had rarely before used, to share her experience “practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.” Standing in her white lab coat in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—a hospital she didn’t work at—Gold panned the camera over the quiet grounds. “It’s really quite empty. The emergency department volume is down,” she says. “The patient census is down.” Gold wasn’t entirely wrong about the hospital census but her causality was off. Hospitals all over the country, including in California at that time, were relatively empty because elective surgeries were canceled and fear of the virus kept people out of the ER. Doctors and nurses would soon be laid off. In her book she describes how her own hospital hours were cut by 30 percent. She doesn’t say how much this may have hurt her bottom line, but in June, her medical practice received more than $150,000 in federal bailout loans, suggesting the lockdowns caused a personal budget deficit large enough to turn many a doctor into an activist. Listen to the latest episode of the Mother Jones Podcast: Subscribe using Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or your favorite podcast app.
None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown and some people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from a QAnon enthusiast, the video spawned the hashtag #filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did.
Even in such a climate, Gold’s white coat stood out, and she managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member: Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriots super-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020.
Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so much so that she would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even though she’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic, she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lockdowns and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committee secretary of the Council for National Policy, a secretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings.
Gold was just the sort of surrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her and said, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and we started emailing and talking, and as things have developed and she watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to Yahoo News. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letter she’d written to Trump, calling the lockdowns a “mass casualty event,” which she’d been urging other doctors to sign. More than 400 had.
With lightning speed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriots hosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry and Breitbart News, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who had signed Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a woman she’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip and shoulder while trying to color her own hair because she couldn’t go to a salon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Gold said.
The call sent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately with some of the major stars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on her show to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingraham said sympathetically, conflating some cherished conservative points of fury.
“Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?”
It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W. Kruglanski is a co-author of the book The Three Pillars of Radicalization. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feel significant, a narrative to follow, and a network that supports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’s splash into right-wing media, he says, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This is sort of an overnight stardom. She has the narrative, and she now has the network that supports her.”
Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors” summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-day summit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on the steps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” and spent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claims suggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, no surprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes that some gynecological problems are caused by having sex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,” she said. “Nobody needs to get sick.”
President Trump and his son Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down for spreading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day.

Simone Gold’s summer media splash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager.

Gold has claimed that the California hospital she worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, and says she hasn’t practiced medicine since. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that, she appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show, one of the most watched prime-time cable news shows, with more than 3 million regular viewers.
On the show, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?” he asked.
Gold agreed and then seized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxychloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country is supposed to work, and physicians should be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’s scary.”
In a sign of how far down the far-right rabbit hole she’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people had said since the video aired, she had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L. Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want to say that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election.

By early fall, it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The virus spiked across the country and researchers declared hydroxychloroquine useless for treating COVID. Even Trump didn’t take it when he got sick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Gold seems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the air since July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website, spokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right fever swamp.
For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or public speeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talk show luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop the steal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radio show hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federal standoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’t submit to Biblical law.
The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.
But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lockdowns and were vaccine skeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, the second-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at least six different appearances on the network founded by televangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off.
In mid-August, when she headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made a surprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you’re gonna make a stand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s televangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for being so generous,” and talked about the small donations from viewers she’d received. “It really adds up,” she said gratefully. “It gave me some breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”
“I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you’re gonna make a stand. It’s going to take money to do that.”
Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, which she pivoted to as hydroxychloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared at a religious revival event in Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracle service,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-right site InfoWars and has called the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religious services in violation of a stay at home order. Gold took the stage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-long speech, where she decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. She said it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, which she dubbed “pure racism.”
“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,” she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’re signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system.”

For most of 2020, the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able to separate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lockdowns and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on the subject in public other than to suggest that “Orange Man bad” and not science drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy.
Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as polls showed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop the steal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degree suggests she is smart enough to know a big lie when she sees one, but “stop the steal” was where the action was, not to mention the speaking gigs and fundraising ops she now relied on for her livelihood since her medical career cratered. Once she started down the MAGA path, there was no turning back.
When Trump supporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Gold shouted from the Supreme Court steps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” to seize power by scaring people with a disease that she said causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”
The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person was stabbed.
That didn’t stop Gold from coming back to DC to speak with many of the same people at the January 5 “stop the steal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter” shirt, Gold said to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is the same reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.”
Kruglanski isn’t surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”
The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the “Wild Protest” organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them.
She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lockdowns over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”
Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist the siren call of an interview with the Washington Post. In a January 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”

“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told the Post that she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted.
Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L. Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold.

So why did she do it? It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’s start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in an interview with KGET. Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”
“Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it.”
Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one’s career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It’s this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”
It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a midlife crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people don’t react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who’ve spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out?

Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in latte liberals—just listen to Fox’s Tucker Carlson repeatedly mock MSNBC host Joy Reid for having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money.
Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold’s—think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected.
Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz’s “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the United States. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters, two-thirds of the defendants had a college education.
Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”
“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me.
When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”

Gold’s initial regret about her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their podcast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hosts Diamond and Silk that she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America’s Frontline Doctors.
Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in the conference lineup, where Gold’s fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God’s template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”
The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L. Lin Wood.
In her speech, Gold announced that her America’s Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can be seen in videos not far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where she implored people to “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”
Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America’s Frontline Doctors website featured a popup box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for them, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstand such aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of free speech.”
As of May 5, she’d raked in $392,000.

Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from a QAnon enthusiast, the video spawned the hashtag #filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even in such a climate, Gold’s white coat stood out, and she managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member: Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriots super-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so much so that she would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even though she’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic, she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lockdowns and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared at a religious revival event in Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracle service,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-right site InfoWars and has called the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religious services in violation of a stay at home order. Gold took the stage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-long speech, where she decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. She said it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, which she dubbed “pure racism.” “They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,” she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’re signing up to be in a pharmacovigilance tracking system.” For most of 2020, the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able to separate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lockdowns and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on the subject in public other than to suggest that “Orange Man bad” and not science drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as polls showed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop the steal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degree suggests she is smart enough to know a big lie when she sees one, but “stop the steal” was where the action was, not to mention the speaking gigs and fundraising ops she now relied on for her livelihood since her medical career cratered. Once she started down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trump supporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Gold shouted from the Supreme Court steps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” to seize power by scaring people with a disease that she said causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!” The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, the Daily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person was stabbed. That didn’t stop Gold from coming back to DC to speak with many of the same people at the January 5 “stop the steal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter” shirt, Gold said to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is the same reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.” Kruglanski isn’t surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.” The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the “Wild Protest” organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lockdowns over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.” Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist the siren call of an interview with the Washington Post. In a January 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.” Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internet sleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos like these online. “Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told the Post that she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L. Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why did she do it? It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’s start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in an interview with KGET. Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.” Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one’s career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It’s this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.” It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a midlife crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people don’t react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who’ve spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out? Simone Gold poses as a hostage for a video she made framing her as victim of government persecution. With co-defendant John Strand (left) and former professional boxer and current Nevada cannabis lawyer Joey Gilbert, a member of the “legal eagle dream team” at Gold’s America’s Frontline Doctors. Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in latte liberals—just listen to Fox’s Tucker Carlson repeatedly mock MSNBC host Joy Reid for having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money. Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold’s—think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected. Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz’s “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the United States. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters, two-thirds of the defendants had a college education. Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.” “You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me. When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.” Gold’s initial regret about her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their podcast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hosts Diamond and Silk that she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America’s Frontline Doctors. Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in the conference lineup, where Gold’s fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God’s template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?” The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L. Lin Wood. In her speech, Gold announced that her America’s Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can be seen in videos not far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where she implored people to “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.” Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America’s Frontline Doctors website featured a popup box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for them, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstand such aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of free speech.” As of May 5, she’d raked in $392,000.

235,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/funeral-fallen-watauga-deputies-remembered-heroes-77544545,"Sgt. Chris Ward and K-9 Deputy Logan Fox were killed during a routine welfare check last week RALEIGH, N.C. -- The sheriff was already running late to the office when a woman pleaded for him to stop. She wanted to pay her respects to the families of Sgt. Chris Ward and K-9 Deputy Logan Fox, but didn't have much to offer. Less than a week ago in Boone, North Carolina, two deputies had been         killed in the line of duty while performing what was supposed to be a routine welfare check. They were met with gunfire and killed after entering the home. “‘It isn’t much, but I would like for them to have it,'” the woman told Watauga County Sheriff Len Hagaman on Tuesday. She handed the sheriff a crumpled-up dollar bill, three quarters and a nickel, proudly noting it was her money. He seriously considered not taking it, realizing she was the one who needed it more. Then it hit him. “Her gift’s worth is not measured by the tactile touch of paper nor that of coin,"" Hagaman said. ""It was, after all, her gift — a gift that cannot be identified by ink and paper, nor that of forged metal. Its worth transcends any worth that we could ever ascribe. It is, however, the quiet and simple gift of hope, faith and love. These are the three attributes of our two fallen brothers.” The deputies may have saved lives, Hagaman said in an         interview last week. The gunman who killed his mother, stepfather and the two deputies owned a lot weapons, which may have been intended for a mass shooting, Hagaman said. The gunman is also suspected of taking his own life during the 13-hour standoff with police. “Had (the shooter) gotten out of the house, the neighborhood would have been in extreme danger,” Hagaman said in the interview. “He did not say anything about targeting law enforcement, just humanity in general.” On Thursday, members of the Boone community and beyond attended the funeral memorializing Ward and Fox. Dozens of family members, law enforcement officials and complete strangers gathered at Appalachian State University’s Holmes Convocation Center to mourn the deputies, with hundreds more watching a livestream of the event from their homes. Overwhelmed by the mix of sadness for their loss but gratitude for the support they've received since their sons died on April 28, the deputies' fathers walked on stage and choked up, but had a clear message. “America, don’t wait for when this happens to show our law enforcement we care,” said Rev. David Ward, Chris' father. Family members remember Ward as a loving son, husband and father of two daughters. He cherished hunting, fishing and being outdoors. The Watauga High School alum started his career at the Beech Mountain Police Department in 2013 and joined the Watauga County Sheriff’s Department in 2018. Fox planned to spend the rest of his life with his high school sweetheart, whom he had been with for seven years. He was long dedicated to serving others, winning the Community Service and Impact Award from his hometown of Beech Mountain at the age of 14. The Ashe County Sheriff's Office recruited him in 2017 and promoted him to K-9 deputy. He then moved to the Watauga County Sheriff’s Office in 2019 to continue his passion. The Rev. Franklin Graham, a Christian evangelical leader and president of Samaritan’s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, sought to console the families during the service. “I’m asked from time to time, ‘Why? Why does God allow pain? Suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people? Why?’” Graham said. “I don’t know. I can’t answer that question. But I do know this: I know that God loves us. I know that for sure. The Bible tells us right here, God’s word. ... I don’t understand it all, but I do believe it all.” Hagaman, the county sheriff, vowed to be there for the families well beyond Thursday. “There’s a brotherhood that is there for each and every one of us,"" he said. “Your heart hurts. You have a void that cannot be filled easily, but I want you to know that we love you, we’re here for you after this ceremony and months and weeks ahead. Thank you for allowing us to have these two brave men protect the citizens of Watauga County.” At 36 and 25, Chris Ward and Logan Fox died as they lived each day since taking their oath to serve the community they so loved: “Heroes,” the fathers declared. ——— Follow Anderson on Twitter at         https://twitter.com/BryanRAnderson. ——— Anderson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

236,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/report-details-police-wounding-suspect-mass-shooting-77544864,"Authorities say a man charged with killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket surrendered after being shot by a police officer who waited for him to come into view down a store aisle DENVER -- A man charged with killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket surrendered after being shot by a police officer who waited for him to come into view down a store aisle, according new information about the shooting released Thursday. The details were contained in a district attorney's report that found Boulder officer Richard Steidell was justified in shooting Ahmad Alissa and said his shots stopped the attack. “Officer Steidell's shots were the last ones fired by anyone inside the King Soopers on March 22,"" District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in the report. Alissa is accused of killing nine shoppers and workers inside and outside the store as well as Officer Eric Talley, one of the first three police officers who entered the store. He also was charged with attempted first-degree murder after authorities said shots were fired at 19 other people, including 11 law enforcement officers. Alissa's defense team has suggested he suffers from mental illness. But they have not offered any other details about his condition. According to the new report, Steidell was part of the second wave of police officers who entered the store after Talley was killed near the cash registers. About 20 seconds later, shots were fired over their heads, with one bullet passing between the heads of two officers. Steidell dove to the ground and fired his handgun at a man he saw holding a long gun down an aisle. The gunman withdrew from view. Steidell remained on the ground, still and pointing his gun down the aisle. When the gunman came back into view about 90 seconds later and raised his weapon, Steidell fired at him, the report states. It was later determined that one of his eight shots — the only ones fired by police during the ordeal — hit Alissa in the right thigh. Steidell, a Coast Guard veteran who has been with Boulder police since 2019, was placed on paid leave while the district attorney's office and outside law enforcement agencies conducted a standard investigation of his decision to shoot at Alissa. The 31-year-old Steidell, who was awarded pistol sharpshooter and rifle marksmanship ribbons in the military, will return to duty Friday now that the district attorney has found his actions were justified, police spokesperson Dionne Waugh said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-06 19:18:15,Report details police wounding of suspect in mass shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

From the first hours of Thursday, it felt like Groundhog Day -- at 7:00 am an Army trainee carrying a rifle hijacked a bus full of elementary school students near Fort Jackson, South Carolina for reasons unknown, before letting them go unharmed. Arrested a short time later, the 23-year-old man was charged with 19 counts of kidnapping, carjacking and other crimes.

A man charged with killing 10 people at a Colorado supermarket surrendered after being shot by a police officer who waited for him to come into view down a store aisle, according to new information about the shooting released Thursday. The details were contained in a district attorney's report that found Boulder officer Richard Steidell was justified in shooting Ahmad Alissa and said his shots stopped the attack. ""Officer Steidell's shots were the last ones fired by anyone inside the King Soopers on March 22,"" District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in the report. Police work the scene outside of a King Soopers grocery store on March 22 where a mass shooting took place in Boulder, Colo. (AP) AHMAD ALISSA CHARGED WITH ANOTHER 43 COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, WEAPONS AND ASSAULT CHARGES Alissa is accused of killing nine shoppers and workers inside and outside the store as well as Officer Eric Talley, one of the first three police officers who entered the store. He also was charged with attempted first-degree murder after authorities said shots were fired at 19 other people, including 11 law enforcement officers. Alissa's defense team has suggested he suffers from mental illness. But they have not offered any other details about his condition. According to the new report, Steidell was part of the second wave of police officers who entered the store after Talley was killed near the cash registers. COLORADO SHOOTING WITNESS DESCRIBES RUSHING KING SOOPERS EMPLOYEES OUT THROUGH LOADING DOCK About 20 seconds later, shots were fired over their heads, with one bullet passing between the heads of two officers.

(AP) The gunman withdrew from view. Steidell remained on the ground, still and pointing his gun down the aisle. When the gunman came back into view about 90 seconds later and raised his weapon, Steidell fired at him, the report states. It was later determined that one of his eight shots — the only ones fired by police during the ordeal — hit Alissa in the right thigh.

Officer found justified to shoot suspect in Boulder grocery store mass shooting The police officer who shot and injured a mass shooting suspect at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store was justified in his actions and won't face criminal charges, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a new report. The suspect, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, was shot in the leg and taken into custody after the March 22 shooting that killed 10 at the King Soopers grocery store. Alissa allegedly started shooting in the grocery store parking lot before running inside and opening fire, according to prosecutors. The first officers arrived within minutes and went into the store, where Boulder police officer Eric Talley was shot and killed, according to prosecutors. Boulder officer Richard Steidell -- who shot and injured Alissa -- said when he arrived at the scene, he saw two victims dead outside, and when he and his fellow officers went inside the King Soopers, he saw Talley with devastating injuries, according to a report released Thursday by Dougherty. As Steidell approached Talley, he said he saw someone with a long gun pointed at the officers, the report said. At least two rounds were then fired at the officers, the report said. Steidell returned fire with one or two shots and ""then waited for the shooter to reemerge,"" the report said. When the suspect moved into Steidell’s view, the officer said he fired about five to 10 rounds, the report said. Investigators later determined Steidell fired eight shots, the report said. Steidell was ""entirely justified in using deadly physical force"" because he knew the suspect ""posed an immediate threat to himself, his fellow officers, and civilians still inside the store,"" Dougherty's report said. ""And, because Steidell fired down an empty shopping aisle and toward the back wall of the store, his use of force did not create a substantial risk of injury"" to people other than Alissa, the report added. Charges against Alissa include 10 counts of first-degree murder and numerous counts of attempted murder.

241,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/05/07/king-soopers-food-donation-boulder-table-mesa-store/,"Trending: A wide array of foods, and other items, on the shelves of the King Soopers Table Mesa store, where a gunman killed ten people in March, are being donated to a local food bank. King Soopers, owned by the Cincinnati-based Kroger supermarket chain, is donating contents of the store to Community Food Share, a local food bank that has been serving the Boulder and Broomfield communities since 1981. “For us, the only decision was to do something good with the store’s inventory,” said Jessica Trowbridge, of corporate affairs with King Soopers and City Market. “So in honor of the victims, their families and our associates we are making this donation to help sustain the Boulder community.” The mass shooting happened on March 22 and the grocery store, a massive crime scene, was linked off to the public with fences for two weeks. The location, which opened in 1972 and was a longtime gathering spot for the local community, was turned back over to Kroger on April 5. It remains closed to the public. King Soopers expects to fill 14 semi-trucks with foods and other goods, including toilet paper, cleaning products, and vitamins, over the next few weeks. “Anything we could donate, we are donating,” Trowbridge said. “It will be the single-largest donation ever to Community Food Shares. We know that this will never fill the loss, but our desire is that this donation truly honors the victims, their families and our associates.” King Soopers officials have not yet come to a decision on the future of the store, at 3600 Table Mesa Drive, Trowbridge said. Kim Da Silva, executive director of the non-profit Community Food Share, said the donation will serve the local community for months to come. “King Soopers has been our longtime partner in hunger relief and food rescue, and even amid tragedy, their commitment remains steadfast,” Da Silva said. “This monumental donation from the Table Mesa store is a gift that honors those who lost their lives through a legacy that will serve their community for months to come.”  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2021-05-07 08:00:41,King Soopers to donate foods from Boulder Table Mesa store to local food bank,,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking
242,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7ee4x/former-neo-nazi-terror-leader-turns-self-in-after-bond-revoked,"The former Michigan cell leader of the neo-Nazi terror group the Base, who was out on bond awaiting trial, turned himself in yesterday after violating the terms of his release and being ordered by a judge back to jail. In October 2020, Justen Watkins, 25, who was at one point overall leader of the Base, was arrested for a series of terrorism-related charges, including ones related to a botched death threat against an antifascist podcaster in 2019. But even though authorities knew he had access to firearms and was posting threateningly about mass murder on social media, Watkins posted bail in February and was required to stay away from other members of the Base as a condition. He didn’t, though, and—according to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office the man who posted his bail was another member of the Base. A local judge ordered Watkins to surrender and turn himself in. “Given the circumstances, the court's decision to revoke Mr. Watkins' bond was the correct course of action,” said Nessel in a statement. “We are pleased with the outcome.” While he was out on bond, Watkins was charged with possessing illegal steroids in February and, in early April, with breaking and entering into a garage on the property where he once held paramilitary training for the Base, alongside an accomplice. This is the person the Attorney General's office asserts paid his bond. Chat logs and other internal materials obtained by VICE News show that Watkins was a particularly violent and outspoken member of the Base who once bragged that if police came to his door to arrest him he would open fire with one of the many firearms he had access to. Watkins was also at the center of a wider conspiracy among hardcore accelerationist neo-Nazis—the type who worship an insurgency manual called Siege (penned in the the 1980s by a hardcore neo-Nazi author) and plan acts of terrorism to hasten the collapse of society—to build an all white, fortified compound in the Upper Penninsula of Michigan, where they could launch the so-called race war. “We are buying houses and land and fortifying them,” said Watkins under one of his many aliases on the encrypted chat app, Wire, in early 2020. “Land is cheap [...]  I’m setting up a community up there. Going to have houses set up to get guys moved in and situated.” The FBI has carried out a years-long nationwide crackdown against the Base since the fall of 2019, with nearly a dozen members total of the Base having been arrested in the U.S. for alleged crimes as wide-ranging as an assassination plot, ghost-gun making, plans for train derailments, and a mass shooting. Recently the Base, along with the Atomwaffen Division, a parallel group connected to five stateside murders and a slew of other crimes, were designated as official terrorist organizations by the Canadian government. Watkins is currently being held in the Washtenaw County Jail and is next set to appear in court later this month.

243,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/651281222/0/indystar/allnews~Red-Flag-judge-Send-cases-to-me-first-not-prosecutor/,"A judge is updating the process for red flag petitions in Marion County after prosecutor Ryan Mears' office was criticized for not submitting a red flag petition to the courts against the FedEx shooter following a police run-in in 2020. Superior Court Judge Amy Jones, who oversees red flag cases in Marion County, initiated the changes this week but they are not yet confirmed, court administrator Emily VanOsdol and IMPD Lt. Shane Foley told IndyStar. The judge will request that law enforcement officers submit red flag cases directly to her courtroom instead of through the prosecutor's office. After that, two judges will decide if there is enough probable cause that the person is dangerous to initiate a hearing over their gun rights. Foley said the new changes will make the red flag process more efficient. FedEx shooting: Marion County Prosecutor Mears criticized for not using red flag law The directive merely brings the process in Marion County in line with Indiana's red flag law, which requires law enforcement officers to file an affidavit with the court within 48 hours of taking a person's gun. IndyStar asked Foley if he could comment on why the criminal justice system in Marion County was not handling these cases according to the process laid out by the law's text. ""I'm not familiar enough with any of that to provide you a statement,"" Foley said. Michael Leffler, a spokesperson for the Marion County Prosecutor's Office, said the office hopes that the changes improve the red flag process. When asked why Marion County wasn't following the process described by the law, Leffler said his office follows the procedural process and expectations set by the courts. The law, which has been in place since 2005 and was updated in 2019, allows enforcement officers to seize a weapon from someone deemed a danger to themselves or others. If a court finds probable cause that they are dangerous, prosecutors then have to build a case against the person and try to convince the judge that they should lose both their firearms and their right to purchase a firearm. Courts have to make a ""good faith effort"" to hold a hearing 14 days after law enforcement brings the case to the attention of a judge. The changes come after the Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police and politicians from Indiana and other states slammed county prosecutors for not pursuing a red flag court proceeding against Brandon Scott Hole, the FedEx shooter, when police confiscated a shotgun from him in March 2020. IMPD intervened after Hole allegedly assaulted his mother and told her that he wanted to commit suicide by cop. In April, Hole shot and killed eight people at a FedEx Ground facility near the Indianapolis International Airport with two rifles he purchased in 2020. It marked the deadliest mass shooting in Indianapolis in 15 years. Red flag law: Expert says FedEx shooting example of 'devastating effect of a failure' If law enforcement filed a red flag petition in court against Hole that year and prosecutors successfully convinced a judge that he was a dangerous person, his information would have been added to a national FBI database preventing him from purchasing firearms in the future. Days after the shooting Mears shielded his office from critiques, telling reporters during a press conference that the law's loose requirement of a hearing within 14 days didn't give him enough time to prepare a case against Hole. Mears' chief of staff Peg McLeish also highlighted that these hearings can be continued in court, delaying any restrictions to their ability to purchase a firearm. Had the petition been submitted against Hole after the March 2020 incident there's no guarantee he would have been prevented from purchasing the two rifles he used to carry out the FedEx shooting.

244,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/colorado-gop-lawmaker-reprimanded-after-calling-colleague-buckwheat-n1266686," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News A Republican state lawmaker from Colorado who referred to a colleague as ""Buckwheat"" during a House session was reprimanded Thursday. State Rep. Richard Holtorf made the remark Wednesday during debate on economic stimulus legislation that would infuse $10 million into Colorado's arts and film industries and cultural organizations, and caused immediate uproar in the chamber. Buckwheat was the name of a stereotypical Black child character in the 1930s ""Our Gang"" and ""Little Rascals"" short films. The character was later repeatedly satirized by comedian Eddie Murphy on ""Saturday Night Live."" “I’m getting there. Don’t worry, Buckwheat. I’m getting there,” Holtorf told an unidentified legislator in the chamber while speaking from the podium Wednesday. ""I'm sorry?"" Democratic House Speaker pro tempore Adrienne Benavidez interrupted. “That’s an endearing term, by the way,” Holtorf continued before Benavidez hammered her gavel and called for order as some members began yelling at Holtorf. ""Why are you yelling at me?"" Holtorf asked before Benavidez called for a recess. Democratic state Rep. Leslie Herod, who is Black, confronted Holtorf, who is white, at the podium immediately after the remarks. “This is what I have to deal with Every. Damn. Day,” she tweeted afterwards. This is what I have to deal with Every. Damn. Day. #onwepress https://t.co/oXfwEPAxt4 Democratic state Rep. Tom Sullivan, one of the lawmakers yelling at Holtorf from the back of the chamber immediately after the Buckwheat comment, tweeted: ""Words matter. (FULL STOP) We MUST NOT accept the use of racist language."" Holtorf later returned to the podium and said, ""I apologize if I’ve offended anybody in any way. It is not my intent, ladies and gentlemen.” On Thursday, he went back to the podium to offer ""my sincerest apologies."" ""I see all of you as my brother and sisters, all created by God and equal. I cherish working with you each and every day,"" he said. State House Speaker Alec Garnett, a Democrat, spoke immediately after Holtorf Thursday to say that the lawmaker had been reprimanded and those he offended had been heard. He said that “discriminatory remarks, whether intentionally launched or carelessly said, have absolutely no place in this House.” He told lawmakers that he and Holtorf had spoken about what happened for an hour, and that “I’m thankful you agree to do your part to reset the decorum of this session.” That decorum was ""grossly breached"" by the use of a racial slur, Garnett said. “I’m sorry to say this is not the first time this session, but I’m speaking today to make sure it is the last."" In an email sent to NBC News on Friday, Holtorf wrote: ""I have already made all the comments that are needed in this matter. There is nothing more to comment about this issue."" In an interview Thursday with Colorado's FOX-31, Holtorf said he was not addressing a Black colleague when he made the remark while speaking on the House floor Wednesday, and added that he wished he'd chosen a difference word. “Where I’m from, that particular term is used for a younger person, a tyke, a kid, a youngster. You don’t use it in a way that is racial or discriminatory or insulting,” he said. Holtorf said the comment had been directed ""at a representative who’s Hispanic, like me, that’s a veteran and a good friend of mine. And I absolutely had in no way, no desire to insult anybody in the Black Caucus. Absolutely not. I wish I would’ve chosen a different word.” Holtorf made headlines earlier this year for insensitive remarks about Sullivan's son Alex, who was killed in a mass shooting in an Aurora movie theater in 2012. Sullivan had cited his son's death in remarks about the importance of the state's ""red flag"" gun laws, marking ""the 448th Friday since my son Alex was murdered in the Aurora theater massacre.” Holtorf spoke after Sullivan, and said, ""I have suffered loss in my life"" before pointing to his years of military service. “The most important lesson I learned — and I offer this to my fellow colleagues, particularly the one that just spoke — is that you have to let go,” he said. (CORRECTION, May 8, 2021 1:32 p.m. EDT) A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of the Colorado House Speaker pro tempore. She is Adrienne Benavidez, not Benevidez.

245,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/651316284/0/milwaukee/sports~A-multitude-of-experiences-has-taught-the-Brewers-Tyrone-Taylor-to-focus-on-the-here-and-now/,"It's been a weird, disjointed, yet productive start to the season thus far for Tyrone Taylor. He was in the starting lineup for the ninth time Friday as the Milwaukee Brewers opened a three-game series at Miami, once again filling in for the injured Christian Yelich in left field. Taylor has also started four times in left field and once in center. In 19 games, he was hitting .282 with three home runs — two of those coming off the bench as a pinch-hitter, including one Wednesday at Philadelphia — and eight runs batted in while also playing above-average defense. Taylor's opportunities have come in a disjointed manner, however, with injuries to Yelich and Lorenzo Cain opening the door. He opened the season at the alternate training site, was recalled on April 14 after Cain was injured, optioned back Sunday and recalled again Tuesday when Yelich went back on the IL after a one-game return against the Phillies didn't go as planned. All of it has been enough to get a young player's head spinning. ""It definitely gets the mind going a little bit,"" Taylor, 27, said. ""But at the end of the day I just remember to stay present and breathe and it is what it is. I’m just thankful to be here, playing baseball. ""I just try to be where my feet are."" Part of Taylor's perspective has come as a result of a long trek through the minor leagues that began in 2012, when he was drafted in the second round by the Brewers out of high school. He worked his way up the ladder, spending two-plus seasons at Class AA Biloxi, before finally breaking through with a big offensive year at Class AAA Colorado Springs in 2018. Taylor made his major-league debut in September 2019 and split his time in 2020 between the alternate training site and the Brewers (22 games) before again hopping on that carousel for the start of this season. ""There’s been some uncertainty, so I just try to stay as present as I can and just go out there and have fun and play baseball,"" said Taylor, who has 785 minor-league games over eight seasons on his ledger. ""I don’t add pressure to myself; it’s just baseball. I’ve been playing since I was a little kid, so I just go out there and enjoy myself and I’m thankful for the opportunities that I’ve been getting and I’m just going to continue to enjoy myself out there."" When asked how he's able to remain so even-keeled, Taylor said he adopted a different mindset after battling through a hamstring strain that cost him most of the 2017 season. The fact he'd spun his wheels for much of his time in Biloxi in 2015-16 also helped set the stage for a mental reset. Then, Taylor told reporters that some of his perseverance can also be credited to his losing a friend in the October 2017 mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Another Brewers farmhand, pitcher Bubba Derby, was at the concert with a few family members and caught in the midst of the shooting. Luckily, they escaped unharmed. ""I feel like at the end of the day each of us have a choice,"" Taylor said. ""I could have been reckless after that and been upset about it and carried it on, or I could choose to live with her in mind like she would want me to. That’s why I enjoy myself, that’s why I have this perspective on life and I’m just thankful to be here. ""I’m still learning to this day, constantly, every day. I practice mindfulness, meditation, do all that stuff. I’m still growing as a person, and I deal with it every day. ""It’s a process."" Jackie Bradley Jr. is tied with Billy McKinney for the team lead with 30 games played. And while the former Rawlings Gold Glove award winner has been as advertised defensively, the offense has been underwhelming as Bradley entered Friday with a .179 average, .584 OPS and a team-high 36 strikeouts. Bradley, who's playing in the National League for the first time after spending his career with the Boston Red Sox, has said in the past he's been a slow starter in previous seasons. Subscribe to our Milwaukee Brewers newsletter for updates on the team. But with Milwaukee's myriad injury problems and a sputtering offense, a surge with the bat from Bradley would be welcome. ""He's off to a little bit of a slow start,"" manager Craig Counsell said. ""The league is pitching him differently. He's a very good fastball hitter and he's seen a lot of off-speed stuff, so there's been a little adjustment period, without question. He's also historically just a streaky player. And so, we've got to be patient there. ""The defense does not go on a slump and it's been really, really good. But he has not kind of gotten on one of those streaks yet, that's for sure."" Bradley has hit three homers while batting in four different spots in the lineup, including one Tuesday at Philadelphia. Always on the hunt for multi-positional players, the Brewers on Friday brought one of the best in franchise history back into the fold by signing Hernán Pérez to a minor-league contract and assigning him to Class AAA Nashville. ""Versatility is a big strength with him and he can handle spots all over the diamond,"" farm director Tom Flanagan. Pérez, 30, spent his five most productive years in the major leagues with the Brewers, hitting .258 with 45 home runs and 175 runs batted in while stealing 67 bases over 572 games spanning 2015-19. He played every position but catcher along the way and developed into a clubhouse favorite and mentor for many of the team's younger Latino players. Milwaukee let Pérez walk after the 2019 season and he eventually latched on with the Chicago Cubs, playing three games for them in 2020 and 10 for the Washington Nationals this season before being designated for assignment earlier this week. Pérez was Washington's opening-day second baseman this season and even pitched twice but had just one hit in 19 at-bats over 10 games (.053). The Brewers already have several players on their 40-man roster with similar skill sets in Pablo Reyes, Daniel Robertson, Jace Peterson and Tim Lopes, but adding another familiar face in Pérez who can play multiple positions could prove helpful down the line. Two games into his first professional season, 2020 first-round pick Garrett Mitchell has been sidelined with what's believed to be a relatively minor injury. Mitchell suffered a strain to the popliteus — the small muscle behind the knee — in his left leg while beating out an infield hit on Tuesday night. He won't play for advanced Class A Wisconsin over the weekend and will be re-evaluated next week with no timetable for his return. The good news is that the injury isn't considered to be serious. Mitchell was off to a great start with the Timber Rattlers, collecting three hits, scoring three runs, walking twice and stealing two bases while also playing a terrific defensive center field.

Many parents believe their own child is incapable of violence, or trust that their own family values will be enough to protect their child from extremist and hateful beliefs. Both assumptions are sadly wrong. Helping all parents and caregivers recognize youth vulnerabilities to persuasive extremist rhetoric – particularly online – is key to preventing further tragedies. As we start to enter a post-pandemic era with more in-person gatherings, following a year in which children’s screen time soared, there’s no more important time to equip them with these preventative tools. There are already troubling signs of increasing youth violence and extremism, with over 180 mass shootings just this year. The good news is that equipping parents isn’t all that difficult. It doesn’t take much to enable front-line adults – parents, caregivers, teachers, coaches, mental health counselors and others who work with youth – to better recognize and respond to extremism. In fact, it only takes a few minutes for adults to be better equipped to recognize and act on signs of radicalization among youth they know. After we developed a guide to help parents better understand online radicalization, we studied what over 750 parents and caregivers learned from reading it. We found that after only seven minutes of reading, participants significantly improved their knowledge and understanding of extremism and youth radicalization in ways that make it more likely they would act appropriately. More than 80% of participants left the study reporting feeling “definitely” or “probably” prepared to talk with youth about online extremism and to intervene with youth they felt were in contact with extremist ideas. This should be welcome news for overburdened parents who are worried about what their kids encountered in unprecedented amounts of time online during the COVID-19 pandemic. It doesn’t take a lot of time to make a very real difference. Parents can build their competence – and their confidence – to intervene while they are drinking their morning coffee. Not everyone in our study learned the same amount. Women spent longer reading the guide and learned significantly more than men did, and left the study more willing to intervene on behalf of young people coming into contact with extremism. This speaks to the crucial role that mothers, grandmothers, aunts and other women mentors can play in combating extremist radicalization. There is strong precedent for mothers’ engagement: organizations run by mothers have worked to combat gun violence, Islamist extremism and drunk driving, among other problems. This evidence suggests the same type of engagement might benefit the fight against domestic violent extremism. Only as strong as our will: Indianapolis mass shooting proves that red flag laws work when they are actually used This isn’t to say that parents are completely clueless. Many parents sense that something is off in their child’s behavior, but they don’t know what exactly is wrong or what to do about it. Shortly before their 21-year old son was charged with killing eight people in massage parlors this spring, his parents kicked him out of the house. Weeks before the El Paso shooting, the shooter’s mother called the police with concerns about her son’s firearm. A year before her son allegedly killed eight people at an Fed Ex facility, an Indiana mother called police with concerns that her son might commit “suicide by cop.” None of these efforts by parents were able to stop the violent acts their sons would eventually commit. But our research suggests that an earlier intervention might help parents recognize warning signs or behavioral changes sooner, and know where to get further help. Parents can’t solve the problem of rising domestic violent extremism alone. It will take far more than individual or community preparedness and resilience to address the root causes that can lead young people down extremist pathways. We need strategies to address the producers of extremist propaganda, reduce the spread of conspiracy theories and disinformation, and tackle rising adult radicalization into a range of conspiracy, anti-government, white supremacist and male supremacist extremist movements. But in the face of what can seem like an overwhelming problem, parents are a key partner to early prevention. For parents worried about their children’s exposure to extremist ideas online, it turns out that answering just two questions positively can make all the difference. Would you talk to a child about extremism? And can you identify the propaganda tactics used by extremists, and the strategies used to combat them? Capitol riot: Trump's exit won't end the far-right violent terrorism threats he fueled We now know that these are learned skills – that parents can improve in ways that may help avert radicalization in their children. As extremist violence ticks up across the country, one thing is exceptionally clear: Families of violent actors have struggled to recognize and respond to early warning signs and know where to get the right kind of help. Getting that help to them as early as possible is a key step in combating extremist growth.

""Three people have been transported to area hospitals following a shooting at Aventura Mall on Saturday afternoon, according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. The shooting took place at around 4 p.m. at the mall located in the 19500 block of Biscayne Blvd,"" CBS Miami reported. Scenes of chaos were posted to Twitter:      Rep. Ted Lieu (R-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           According to a report from the Daily Beast's Roger Sollenberger, a Republican state senator running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives has been accused of stealing passages from an op-ed her opponent wrote for the Wall Street Journal and then using them in an email appeal for donations to her campaign. Sen. Jen Kiggan's (R) is making a run for the seat currently being held by Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA) and recently sent out an email in the hopes of bolstering her campaign against the incumbent lawmaker.

Officers arrived at a trailer to find six dead adults and a man with serious injuries who died later at a hospital,         the Colorado Springs Gazette reported.

268,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/may/10/vaccination-benefit-show-draws-302m-birthday/,"Birthday party shooter kills 6 people, self COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- A gunman opened fire at a birthday party in Colorado, slaying six adults before killing himself Sunday, police said. The shooting happened just after midnight Sunday in a mobile home park on the east side of Colorado Springs, police said. Officers arrived at a trailer to find six dead adults and a man with serious injuries who died later at a hospital, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. The suspected shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children. He walked inside and opened fire before shooting himself, police said. The birthday party was for one of the people killed, police said. Police on Sunday hadn't released the identities of the shooter or victims. Authorities say a motive wasn't immediately known. Children at the attack weren't hurt and were placed with relatives. ""My heart breaks for the families who have lost someone they love and for the children who have lost their parents,"" Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement. It was Colorado's worst mass shooting since a gunman killed 10 people at a Boulder supermarket March 22. Colorado Springs, population 465,000, is Colorado's second-biggest city after Denver. Vaccination benefit show draws $302M LOS ANGELES -- The Global Citizen fundraising concert advocating the importance of vaccine equity has pulled in $302 million, exceeding the goal for the organization's campaign. Global Citizen announced Saturday that the funds raised helped procure more than 26 million doses at the ""Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World."" The organization said money was garnered through several philanthropic and corporate commitments. President Joe Biden, Prince Harry and Jennifer Lopez were among the big names who took part in the event, which was recorded May 2 and aired Saturday. ABC, ABC News Live, CBS, YouTube and iHeartMedia radio stations will broadcast the concert staged at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Selena Gomez hosted the show, which was attended by several thousand fully-vaccinated concertgoers who cheered on performances by Eddie Vedder, Foo Fighters, J Balvin, H.E.R. and Lopez, who enjoyed a duet with her mom. Ben Affleck, Chrissy Teigen, Jimmy Kimmel, Sean Penn and David Letterman served as special guest speakers. Vax Live was one of the largest concert gatherings in Southern California since the coronavirus pandemic roiled the world more than a year ago. Organizers called the event the country's first large-scale music event for a covid-19-compliant audience. Media and production staff needed to show a negative covid-19 test before entering the stadium. 8 people shot, 1 dies in Phoenix hotel PHOENIX -- One man was killed and seven other people were wounded in a shooting inside a downtown Phoenix hotel after an argument early Sunday, police said. Officers responded to a call about a shooting at the Hyatt Regency Phoenix hotel around 12:30 a.m., Sunday. Police said a group of people between the ages of 18 and 22 who all were attending a function inside the hotel had an argument that escalated into shots being fired. ""We do believe this is an isolated incident and not a random act,"" police spokeswoman Sgt. Maggie Cox said, adding that detectives were still interviewing witnesses. ""There was definitely more than one shooter,"" she said. ""After the argument, different people within that group began shooting at each other."" It was unclear what kind of event was being held at the upscale hotel located near the city's convention center and close to the Arizona Diamondbacks' ballpark and Phoenix Suns' basketball arena. Cox said arriving officers evacuated the hotel staff from the building before doing a search to make sure there wasn't an active shooter. They located a man who was declared dead at the scene and then helped the wounded -- six men and one woman -- get treatment before they were taken to hospitals. Denver lawman injured, gunman sought DENVER -- An officer in Colorado was shot in the leg and police launched a search for the shooter. Officers responded late Saturday to a home in Denver on a report of a person on a porch who did not belong there, Division Chief Ron Thomas told reporters early Sunday. The shooter opened fire on officers at the scene and one officer was shot in the leg, Thomas said. The officer was taken to Denver Health Medical Center in critical condition. Police were not immediately sure whether the suspect was in custody. Thomas said officers made contact with multiple ""individuals of interest"" but the investigation was still ongoing. Authorities set up a perimeter in the area of the shooting in search of the suspect. Residents in the community northwest of downtown were encouraged to stay inside their homes. The search involving police dogs ended and the area reopened to the public Sunday morning, the Denver Post reported. -- Compiled by Democrat-Gazette staff from wire reports Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc.

269,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/10/there-were-at-least-9-mass-shootings-across-the-u-s-this-weekend/,"Trending: A gunman opened fire at a family birthday party in Colorado Springs, leaving six people dead and a community in mourning. “Words fall short to describe the tragedy that took place this morning,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement. “From the officers who responded to the shooting to the investigators still on scene, we are all left incredibly shaken.” The suspected shooter — believed to be a boyfriend of one of the victims — is also dead, according to Colorado Springs Police. The tragedy was one of at least nine mass shootings that occurred across the US over the weekend. At least 15 people were killed and 30 more injured in mass shootings since Friday night, according to CNN reporting and an analysis of data from Gun Violence Archive (GVA), local media and police reports. CNN defines a mass shooting as incident with four or more people killed or wounded by gunfire — excluding the shooter. From a townhome community and a neighborhood park, to a hotel and a nightclub, these are the mass shootings that shook communities across seven states. An overnight shooting at the Hyatt Regency Hotel left one man dead and at least seven others wounded, Phoenix Police Sgt. Margaret Cox said during a news conference Sunday morning. A group attending an event at the hotel got into an altercation that resulted in the gunfire, Cox said. All of the victims are believed to be between the ages of 18 and 22. Cox told reporters there was more than one shooter, but investigators are trying to find exactly how many and what types of guns were used. The shooting was an isolated incident and not a random act, she added. Three people are dead and another was injured during a shooting at a townhome Saturday morning just outside of Baltimore, authorities said. Police responded to a call for an active shooter and fire scene at a townhome community in the Woodlawn suburb, the Baltimore County Police Department said in a news release. Investigators say the suspect lit his residence on fire and forced his way into his neighbors’ home, where he then shot and stabbed them, according to the release. He shot two more neighbors as they came out of their home, including a 24-year-old who died, the release said. The suspect was confronted by responding officers who ordered him drop his handgun, according to the release. He was then shot by officers and taken into custody after refusing, the release said, and later died in the hospital. At least three people were killed and nine others injured in three separate shootings in California. In Los Angeles, one person died and five others were injured in a shooting late Sunday night. Three people with gunshot injuries were taken to hospitals in critical condition and a fifth person who suffered a non-life-threatening injury was also transported, according to a media alert from the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD). On Saturday, four people were injured in a shooting outside of a nightclub in Citrus Heights, police told CNN affiliate KCRA. Officers found several fights happening in the parking lot of the club and surrounding area, according to the affiliate. That same night, more than 400 miles away in Compton, police were in the area when they heard shots fired. Deputies found two men believed to be 15-20 years old dead at the scene, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Police were later alerted to two other people seeking treatment for gunshot wounds at a nearby hospital. Four people were injured in a shooting in Newark, New Jersey, on Sunday, according to a tweet from the police department. Two men and two women “were injured by gunfire,” according to the tweet. Police are asking anyone with information to call 1-877-NWK-TIPS to provide tips. Authorities in Milwaukee are investigating a shooting that injured four people on Saturday afternoon, a news release from the Milwaukee Police Department said. The victims, ages 23 to 45, all suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the release said. Two men have been arrested in connection with the shooting and charges will be forwarded to the prosecutor’s office in the coming days, according to the release. Two people are dead and three others injured after a shooting in a park in Kinloch, Missouri, on Friday night, St. Louis County Police said in a news release. “It was all peaceful and beautiful and next thing you know … gunfire just erupted,” Willoid Williams, who witnessed the shooting, told CNN affiliate KMOV. Williams said he was in the area for a “neighborhood celebration” when a truck pulled up and started shooting. “It’s just outrageous, it was crazy,” Williams said. Related Articles

271,https://nypost.com/2021/05/10/identities-of-colorado-springs-shooting-victims-released/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Yaron Steinbuch Submit May 10, 2021 | 8:12am				| Updated May 10, 2021 | 9:28am A woman who survived the shooting in Colorado that left six people and the gunman dead said the party where the massacre took place was to celebrate her birthday — as the victims of the shooting have been identified. Nuvia Marquez, 28, said the extended family were celebrating her birthday and those of her brother, Melvin Perez, who would have turned 31 this week, and their mother, Joana Cruz, who would have turned 54, the Gazette reported. “My mom had always liked celebrating them together,” said Marquez, who was at the party with her husband, Freddy Marquez. Those killed in the bloodbath were identified as Melvin Perez; Joana Cruz; Nuvia’s other brother, Jose Gutierrez, 21; Melvin’s wife, Mayra Perez, 32; and Mayra’s sister Sandra Ibarra and brother Jose Ibarra, according to the report. The shooter, described as the boyfriend of one of the victims, arrived at the birthday party shortly after midnight Sunday and opened fire before taking his own life, the Colorado Springs Police Department said. Police arrived to find six people dead plus a seventh who was seriously wounded and died after being taken to a hospital.“The children at the trailer were uninjured by the suspect and are now with relatives,” the statement said. Family, friends and children were celebrating inside a trailer at the Canterbury Manufactured Home Community, a mobile home park of largely Latino residents about 70 miles south of Denver. Freddy Marquez identified the suspected gunman as Sandra’s boyfriend, described him as “quiet” and “serious,” and said he always carried a gun. He had met the man only once and said “there was nothing out of the ordinary” about him. Freddy described his mother-in-law, Joana Cruz, as “loving” and “hard-working.”“She was always laughing,” he told the Gazette, adding that her sons were “just like their mom. They were all great people.” A fundraiser for funeral expenses had raised more than $7,500 by Monday morning. “Mayra was a great employee and a friend. I got to know many members of her family, including her husband, sister and mother-in-law. I cannot imagine the pain this loss must be and how their children will cope with this tragic and senseless loss,” one Facebook user posted on the site. A woman who lives near the mobile home park said she woke up to the sound of what she believes were gunshots and eventually heard crying outside. Two young kids were put in the back of a police car.“And on Mother’s Day,” the woman, who did not wish to be named, told the news outlet. In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis called the mass shooting a “terrible act of violence,” occurring as “many of us are spending the day celebrating the women in our lives who have made us the people we are today.” He added: “Families torn apart, and at a birthday party, no less.” Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers called the attack a “senseless act of violence.” “Today we find ourselves mourning the loss of lives and praying solemnly for those who were injured and those who lost family members,” Suthers said in a statement. “We think, too, of the emergency personnel who responded to a horrific scene and we keep them in our prayers today.” Police Chief Vince Niski said the officers who responded “are all left incredibly shaken.”“This is something you hope never happens in your own community, in the place that you call home,” he said, according to the Gazette.“My vow to this community and to the families who have lost someone today is that this department will do everything we can to find you the answers you deserve and be here for you with an unwavering support,” the chief added.

The shooting at a Colorado Springs, Colorado, mobile home park early Sunday is the 13th mass killing this year, according to database compiled by USA TODAY, Northeastern University and The Associated Press. Colorado Springs police responded to reports of shots fired shortly after midnight Sunday at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park and found six people dead. A seventh was taken to the hospital where he later died. ""The suspect, a boyfriend of one of the female victims, drove to the residence, walked inside and began shooting people at the party before taking his own life. This horrific act has resulted in the death of six adult victims,"" Colorado Springs Police Department said in a statement. The group was gathered inside the residence for a birthday party, and friends, family and children all inside, police said. No children were injured in the shooting, and all were with relatives Sunday. Police said on Twitter that they would release the victims' names in a Tuesday news conference. A mobile crime lab was parked early Monday outside the Colorado Springs home, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape as officers guarded the scene. By midafternoon the tape was gone; a sign stood in front of the home advertising “Grief Support, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,"" at the mobile home park office. A small crowd of mourners arrived to pay their respects, leaving bouquets of yellow roses and devotional candles on a small table they set up in front of the home. They silently gazed, then left without comment under a dark, gray sky and blustering winds. Someone closed a partially open window in the home from the outside. Freddy Marquez told the Denver Post he was at the party before the shooting with his wife and children, and the victims were all of the same extended family. The party was to celebrate his wife's and her brother's birthdays, but Marquez said his family left around 10 p.m. because his wife had to work the next day. 'Unspeakable acts': Gunman kills 6, then self, at birthday party in Colorado Springs, Colorado, police say “It was all family, so everything was fine,” he told the newspaper. When his wife woke up the next morning, she saw numerous missed calls. Marquez's wife's mother, two brothers and three extended family members died. “It’s just crazy; it’s not what we expected on Mother’s Day,” he told the Post. “I’m at a loss for words.” Neighbor Yenifer Reyes told the newspaper she thought the gunshots she heard were a thunderstorm but, ""then I started hearing sirens."" Gladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, tearfully recalled the home’s owner, whom she identified as Joana, as a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors, ask how they were doing, and brag about her children. “She was an incredibly pleasant woman, very beautiful, happy all the time,” Bustos told AP. “She loved to chat. And she was very proud of her family.” The gunfire that startled Bustos from her sleep early Sunday had forever changed what she described as a safe and welcoming neighborhood. “We’re all in shock,"" she said. “How can this happen here? This is all so painful, so devastating, so overwhelming.” Authorities have not yet released the identities of the victims, and police said they are still investigating a motive for the shooting. Marquez told the Denver Post he didn't know the suspected shooter well and the man was not at the party earlier. ""This is something you hope never happens in your own community, in the place that you call home. When these types of unspeakable acts happen, there is nothing that can be done to fully rebuild what was lost or replace those who are no longer with us,"" Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said on Twitter that the shooting was ""devastating, especially as many of us are spending the day celebrating the women in our lives who have made us the people we are today.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crime report data indicates about 1 in 5 homicide victims in the U.S. are killed by an intimate partner. Over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current of former male partner, the CDC says. The massacre is the second mass killing in Colorado this year, according to the USA TODAY, Northeastern University and The Associated Press database, which defines mass killing as those in which four or more people were killed, not including the assailant. Columbine, Aurora, Boulder: Colorado has the sixth-highest rate of public mass killings In March, 10 people were killed in Boulder when a gunman opened fire at a grocery store. The shooting occurred less than a week after rampage at Atlanta-area spas left eight people dead, mostly women of Asian descent. The shooting this weekend is the deadliest in the U.S. since a former employee at an Indianapolis FedEx facility killed eight people before dying by suicide. Three of the 13 mass killings this year have occurred in Indiana, said James Alan Fox, professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University. Seven of the 13 were in residential settings; an eighth was partially in a residence, he said.

COLORADO SPRINGS — A man walked into a birthday party in Colorado Springs early Sunday and opened fire, killing six people before ending his own life, police said, in what is now one of Colorado’s deadliest mass shootings. Freddy Marquez, who attended the party with his wife and children, but left before the shooting, said all of the victims were members of the same extended family, which had gathered to celebrate the birthdays of Marquez’s wife and her brother. The shooting happened just after midnight at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park in the 2800 block of Preakness Way, Colorado Springs police Lt. James Sokolik said in a news release. Investigators believe the shooter, who has not been publicly identified, was the boyfriend of a woman at the party. “He drove to the residence, walked inside and began shooting people at the party before taking his own life,” Sokolik said in the news release. None of the children at the party were hurt and they are now in the care of relatives, police said. Marquez said he and his wife and four of their children stayed at the party until about 10 p.m. Saturday, then left because his wife had to work early Sunday morning. The party was calm, a relaxed gathering of extended family, he said. The group shared two piñata-shaped cakes and watched a boxing match. “It was all family, so everything was fine,” he said Marquez and his wife went to bed without knowing anything was wrong, until his wife woke around 4 a.m. to get ready for work and saw all her missed calls. “It’s just crazy, it’s not what we expected on Mother’s Day,” Marquez said. “I’m at a loss for words.” Marquez said his wife lost her mother and two brothers in the shooting, as well as three other members of her extended family. The whole family was very close and often got together to celebrate special occasions, he said. “They were loving people,” Marquez said. “Caring, happy. They’d give you the shirt off their back.” Marquez said he did not know the suspected shooter very well, and noted that he had not been at the party earlier in the evening. Police responded to the shooting at 12:18 a.m. and arrived to find six bodies. Another man was alive but mortally injured. He died at a hospital. Neighbor Yenifer Reyes said she woke to the sound of many gunshots. “I thought it was a thunderstorm,” she said. “Then I started hearing sirens.” Marvin Romero also lives nearby. He was asleep when the shooting started and woke up to bangs that he thought might be a hammer on concrete. “I heard, ‘Boom, boom, boom,’” he said Sunday afternoon. Reyes said she watched police bring children out of the trailer and put them into at least one patrol car. “They were crying hysterically,” she said. The identities of the victims and the suspected shooter will be released by the El Paso County coroner following the notification of next of kin, police said. Colorado’s latest mass shooting comes just seven weeks after a gunman killed 10 people — including employees, shoppers and a police officer — at a King Soopers grocery store in Boulder. Colorado Springs police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement that the department was “incredibly shaken” by Sunday’s killings. “This is something you hope never happens in your own community, in the place that you call home,”  he said. “When these types of unspeakable acts happen, there is nothing that can be done to fully rebuild what was lost or replace those who are no longer with us.” Gov. Jared Polis released a statement offering his prayers and condolences to the victims, their families and anyone impacted by the killings. “The tragic shooting in Colorado Springs is devastating, especially as many of us are spending the day celebrating the women in our lives who have made us the people we are today,” he said. “Multiple lives were taken today by this terrible act of violence. Families torn apart, and at a birthday party no less.”  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Plus, how a woman who had multiple miscarriages found comfort in baking Last modified on Mon 10 May 2021 12.23 BST Good morning. More than a year after coronavirus hit the US, killing more than half a million Americans to date, the White House declared yesterday that the country was finally “turning the corner” on the pandemic. But with infections, hospital admissions and deaths dramatically lower, the Biden administration faces growing pressure to help countries that are still in the grip of Covid-19.  “We are turning the corner,” Jeffrey Zients, the White House Covid response coordinator, said. He also said the country was on track to meet Joe Biden’s goal of getting a minimum of 70% of Americans at least partially vaccinated by 4 July. “The light at the end of the tunnel is brighter and brighter,” he said. It comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) said the inequity in vaccine access was “grotesque” and a “moral outrage” as the pandemic continued to rage in India and across south Asia. How many Americans have been vaccinated so far? About 58% of adults have had at least one shot and about 113 million are fully vaccinated. In stark contrast, in some countries in Africa only 1% of the population has been vaccinated. But some people are reluctant to give up mask-wearing, writes Julia Carrie Wong. Israeli police stormed a sacred Jerusalem site that holds the Dome of the Rock after all-night clashes with Palestinian protesters. The violence came before a planned Jerusalem Day march today by hardline Israeli nationalists. About 180 people were injured overnight, according to the Palestine Red Crescent, and 50 were admitted to hospital after officers in riot gear clashed with demonstrators in East Jerusalem. Republican infighting is expected to come to a climax this week, encouraged by Donald Trump, as they prepare to remove Liz Cheney as the party’s number three leader in the chamber as punishment for her public criticism of the former president. It comes after the congresswoman from Wyoming spoke out against Trump for his role in inciting the 6 January Capitol insurrection and his claims that the election was stolen from him. She was one of 10 Republicans to vote in favor of his second impeachment. In a bad sign for Cheney, Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader who has previously defended her, said he was endorsing her rival Elise Stefanik. Despite his election loss, Trump has burrowed so far into the DNA of the Republican party that the two are now all but inseparable, writes our Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith. Colorado was today mourning the victims of yet another deadly shooting after a gunman opened fire at a birthday party, killing six adults before killing himself. Police said the shooting, in the early hours of Sunday, was in a mobile home park on the east side of Colorado Springs. The suspected shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party, which was attended by friends, family and children. It was the state’s worst mass shooting since a gunman killed 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder on 22 March. The Colorado governor, Jared Polis, said the latest shooting was “devastating”. The opioid crisis was “manufactured”, the maker of a damning documentary about its origins has claimed in an interview with the Guardian. Alex Gibney’s two-part HBO docuseries The Crime of the Century reframes the crisis, which killed nearly half a million Americans between 2000 and 2019, as a crime of fraudulent marketing and corporate greed. “The crisis was manufactured. It was not something that just happened,” he tells Adrian Horton. The Biden administration issued an emergency declaration yesterday to avoid fuel shortages after the US’s worst ever infrastructure cyber-attack shut down a vital pipeline supplying the east coast. The pipeline, run by Colonial Pipeline, carries gasoline and other fuel from Texas to the north-east and carries about 45% of fuel used on the east coast. The Myanmar poet Khet Thi has died in detention and his body returned with the organs removed, according to his family. His wife said they were both taken for interrogation on Saturday. Khet Thi, whose Facebook page stated he was 45, wrote the line: “They shoot in the head but they don’t know the revolution is in the heart.” Amid an unprecedented shortage of job applicants for restaurant jobs in the US, a survey by One Fair Wage of more than 2,800 workers, revealed that 53% were thinking about quitting. Of those, 76% said they wanted to leave because of low wages and tips, while 78% said they might stay if they were paid a “full, stable, liveable wage”. In this moving piece, Alexandra King describes finding comfort in baking after multiple miscarriages.

275,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/police-seek-motive-shooting-colorado-birthday-party-77601786,"Police in Colorado are investigating what led a gunman to open fire at a birthday party inside a trailer park home, killing six adults before he took his own life COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- A shooting at a birthday party inside a trailer park home in Colorado Springs that killed six people before the gunman took his own life stunned a state weary of gun violence just weeks after another Colorado mass shooting killed 10 people. Police on Monday were investigating what led the gunman, who they said was the boyfriend of one of the victims, to walk into the crowded party early Sunday and open fire. Six adults were killed at the home at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado's second-largest city, and a seventh died at a hospital, authorities said. The shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children, police said. Authorities didn't release the names of the victims, gunman or disclose a possible motive. Nor did they release any further details on what weapon or weapons were used. Officials were still in the process of identifying the victims, Sandy Wilson of the El Paso County Coroner’s Office said Monday. The attack follows a series of mass shootings across the U.S. this year, including one on March 22 at a crowded supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer. The gunman in that attack faces multiple charges including first-degree murder. He has yet to enter a plea pending a mental health evaluation requested by his public defenders. A mobile crime lab was parked early Monday outside the Colorado Springs home, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape as officers guarded the scene. By midafternoon the tape was gone; a sign stood in front of the home advertising “Grief Support, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,"" at the mobile home park office. A small crowd of mourners arrived to pay their respects, leaving bouquets of yellow roses and devotional candles on a small table they set up in front of the home. They silently gazed, then left without comment under a dark, gray sky and blustering winds. Someone closed a partially open window in the home from the outside. Gladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, tearfully recalled the home’s owner, whom she identified as Joana, as a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors, ask how they were doing, and brag about her children. “She was an incredibly pleasant woman, very beautiful, happy all the time,” Bustos said. “She loved to chat. And she was very proud of her family.” The gunfire that startled Bustos from her sleep early Sunday had forever changed what she described as a safe and welcoming neighborhood. “We’re all in shock,"" she said. “How can this happen here? This is all so painful, so devastating, so overwhelming.” Another neighbor, Yenifer Reyes,         told The Denver Post that she woke to the sound of gunfire and later saw police escorting children who were “crying hysterically” from the home. The children weren't hurt in the attack and have been placed with relatives, police said. The first fire crews to respond to the shooting were told to stay back because of possible gunfire — then given an all-clear to approach the home an agonizing eight minutes after the initial dispatch, according to a recording of a Colorado Springs dispatch call. As the magnitude of the shooting became clearer, the first on the scene requested more ambulances and engine crews. Sirens are heard in the background as responders at the scene request more help. “Engine 11, sounds like more shots are still being fired -- keep your distance,” a dispatcher says at one point. Twenty seconds later the engine crew responds: “Looking like we have multiple victims,” and asks for more ambulances. The dispatcher requests another engine to “2828 Preakness Way, possible multiple gunshot victims.” More than eight minutes in, the dispatcher says that “police on scene are advising that there are four victims and that you are clear to go in.” Soon thereafter, Engine 11 requests another ambulance; 13 minutes in the dispatcher says: “The sergeant on the scene is saying that medical is cleared to enter for all six patients. ... They’re saying we have six.” The attack         was the latest mass killing — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year. Before the Colorado Springs shooting, a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University showed there had been at least 11 mass shootings since Jan. 1, compared to just two public mass shootings in 2020. Colorado Springs saw a 2015 attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people, including a police officer, and injured eight others. Earlier that year, a man shot three people to death at random before dying in a shootout with police. In 2007, a man killed two people and wounded three at Colorado Springs' New Life Church before taking his own life. Earlier the same day, he'd killed two people and injured two at a Youth With a Mission Center in the Denver suburb of Arvada. Colorado also suffered the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that killed 13 people before the two student attackers took their own lives, and the 2012 massacre at the Aurora movie theater that killed 12 people and injured 70. After the Boulder shooting, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to create a state “Office of Gun Violence Prevention” to educate residents about gun safety and collect data on Colorado gun violence. Other bills advancing through the Democrat-led Legislature would tighten background checks, allow municipalities greater freedom to adopt their own gun control laws that are stricter than state law, and require a person facing a protection order related to alleged domestic violence to report what firearms they possess. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has signed into law this year legislation requiring safe firearms storage and the reporting of lost or stolen firearms. ——— Anderson and Slevin reported from Denver. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-10 10:59:16,Police seek motive in shooting at Colorado birthday party,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

We think too of the emergency personnel who responded to a horrific scene and we keep them in our prayers today. “We ask the public’s patience with the investigation and we seek the sensitivity of our media partners as CSPD completes a thorough investigation to provide answers to the families and friends impacted by this tragedy.” “Words fall short to describe the tragedy that took place this morning. As the chief of police, as a husband, as a father, as a grandfather, as a member of this community, my heart breaks for the families who have lost someone they love and for the children who have lost their parents. From the officers who responded to the shooting to the investigators still on scene, we are all left incredibly shaken. This is something you hope never happens in your own community, in the place that you call home. When these types of unspeakable acts happen, there is nothing that can be done to fully rebuild what was lost or replace those who are no longer with us. My vow to this community and to the families who have lost someone today, is that this department will do everything we can to find you the answers you deserve and be here for you with an unwavering support.” “It breaks my heart to learn there’s been another mass shooting, today in southeast Colorado Springs. “At a birthday party on Mother’s Day — a day and time when we should all be celebrating life and love — many people are now mourning the tragic loss of life. “My deepest condolences go out to the families, friends, and loved ones of the victims.” “El Paso County is devastated by the senseless act of violence carried out last night resulting in the death of innocent citizens at a birthday party. We offer our sincere prayers to the families of the victims, the first responders, and those in law enforcement who must investigate this tragic crime. We pray for peace and healing within our community. We stand ready to offer any support to our brothers and sisters in the City of Colorado Springs. “The shooting suspect, the boyfriend of a female victim, drove to a trailer where a birthday party was being held with friends, family and children in attendance. He walked inside and began shooting party attendees before taking his own life, police said.” “This is absolutely terrible. I grieve for the victims and with their families. I’m horrified that children witnessed this tragedy. My thoughts are with Colorado Springs and our whole state on this dark day.” “Absolutely heartbreaking.

In certain states or cities, I would have to think before going to a concert or attending some other kind of social event where groups of people gathered. Here is the death and injury rate in the last 36 hours. If I were Black or Asian I would have to have a compelling reason to come to the United States.  The article below lists mass shootings for one month, from the 16th of March to the 15th of April. How is this not seen as insane? It isn’t just the fact that there are more guns than people in America; it is also, and mostly, a national obsessive psychotic fascination focused on guns and the social violence they produce. When eight people died in a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility Thursday night, the news was compounded by a string of similar incidents that preceded it.Starting on March 16, when eight people were killed at three Atlanta-area spas, the US has had at least 45 mass shootings, according to CNN reporting and an analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), local media, and police reports.Analysis: A return to normal in America means a return to violenceThe US has seen at least 147 mass shootings in 2021, according to data from the GVA, a non-profit based in Washington.CNN considers an incident to be a mass shooting if four or more people are shot, wounded, or killed, excluding the gunman; so does the GVA.Here are the 45 incidents reported since March 16. Eight people were killed and several others wounded in a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx facility on Thursday night, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Genae Cook said.LIVE UPDATES At least six people were injured at an Escambia County apartment complex, as reported by CNN affiliate WEAR-TV. … The second amendment is a failed social experiment. It simply needs to be repealed. Perhaps an anger management system needs to be taught in the schools, starting with the very young. I even see a military style weapon with a large clip in the picture with a police officer holding it. Are they really needed? Why do the police need military style weapons? Are they going to be used to kill lots of innocent people if even by accident? Bullets bounce off of any hard surface and could kill innocent people easily. This copied from todays posting from the LA Times on Microsoft News site. “As of about noon Monday on the West Coast, the nation had endured at least 355 separate shooting incidents over the previous 72 hours in which 123 people died and 297 were wounded. The sick thing is that’s not unusual.” Unfortunately there are no gun control regulations that will stop or even slow this madness. Our society is breaking down, coming unglued whether the police or random individuals, many of whom not part of any organization, reaching for a gun driven by fear and rage.

Police on Monday were investigating what led the gunman, who they said was the boyfriend of one of the victims, to walk into the crowded party early Sunday and open fire. Six adults were killed at the home at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado’s second-largest city, and a seventh died at a hospital, authorities said. The shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children, police said. Authorities didn’t release the names of the victims, gunman or disclose a possible motive. Nor did they release any further details on what weapon or weapons were used. Officials were still in the process of identifying the victims, Sandy Wilson of the El Paso County Coroner’s Office said Monday. The attack follows a series of mass shootings across the U.S. this year, including one on March 22 at a crowded supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer. The gunman in that attack faces multiple charges including first-degree murder. He has yet to enter a plea pending a mental health evaluation requested by his public defenders. A mobile crime lab was parked early Monday outside the Colorado Springs home, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape as officers guarded the scene. By midafternoon the tape was gone; a sign stood in front of the home advertising “Grief Support, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,” at the mobile home park office. A small crowd of mourners arrived to pay their respects, leaving bouquets of yellow roses and devotional candles on a small table they set up in front of the home. They silently gazed, then left without comment under a dark, gray sky and blustering winds. Someone closed a partially open window in the home from the outside. Gladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, tearfully recalled the home’s owner, whom she identified as Joana, as a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors, ask how they were doing, and brag about her children. “She was an incredibly pleasant woman, very beautiful, happy all the time,” Bustos said. “She loved to chat. And she was very proud of her family.” The gunfire that startled Bustos from her sleep early Sunday had forever changed what she described as a safe and welcoming neighborhood. “We’re all in shock,” she said. “How can this happen here? This is all so painful, so devastating, so overwhelming.” Another neighbor, Yenifer Reyes, told The Denver Post that she woke to the sound of gunfire and later saw police escorting children who were “crying hysterically” from the home. The children weren’t hurt in the attack and have been placed with relatives, police said. The first fire crews to respond to the shooting were told to stay back because of possible gunfire — then given an all-clear to approach the home an agonizing eight minutes after the initial dispatch, according to a recording of a Colorado Springs dispatch call. As the magnitude of the shooting became clearer, the first on the scene requested more ambulances and engine crews. Sirens are heard in the background as responders at the scene request more help. “Engine 11, sounds like more shots are still being fired — keep your distance,” a dispatcher says at one point. Twenty seconds later the engine crew responds: “Looking like we have multiple victims,” and asks for more ambulances. The dispatcher requests another engine to “2828 Preakness Way, possible multiple gunshot victims.” More than eight minutes in, the dispatcher says that “police on scene are advising that there are four victims and that you are clear to go in.” Soon thereafter, Engine 11 requests another ambulance; 13 minutes in the dispatcher says: “The sergeant on the scene is saying that medical is cleared to enter for all six patients. … They’re saying we have six.” The attack was the latest mass killing — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year. Before the Colorado Springs shooting, a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University showed there had been at least 11 mass shootings since Jan. 1, compared to just two public mass shootings in 2020. Colorado Springs saw a 2015 attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people, including a police officer, and injured eight others. Earlier that year, a man shot three people to death at random before dying in a shootout with police. In 2007, a man killed two people and wounded three at Colorado Springs’ New Life Church before taking his own life. Earlier the same day, he’d killed two people and injured two at a Youth With a Mission Center in the Denver suburb of Arvada. Colorado also suffered the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that killed 13 people before the two student attackers took their own lives, and the 2012 massacre at the Aurora movie theater that killed 12 people and injured 70. After the Boulder shooting, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to create a state “Office of Gun Violence Prevention” to educate residents about gun safety and collect data on Colorado gun violence. Other bills advancing through the Democrat-led Legislature would tighten background checks, allow municipalities greater freedom to adopt their own gun control laws that are stricter than state law, and require a person facing a protection order related to alleged domestic violence to report what firearms they possess. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has signed into law this year legislation requiring safe firearms storage and the reporting of lost or stolen firearms. ___ Anderson and Slevin reported from Denver.

The Denver Police Department is holding Gallegos to explore attempted first-degree murder, possession of a weapon by a previous offender and first-degree criminal trespassing. An officer was shot in the leg Saturday night before 11 p.m. in the 4200 block of Alcott Street in Denver’s Sunnyside neighborhood. There was an hours-long manhunt that ensued into Sunday morning. Following emergency surgery, the officer was listed in stable condition Sunday afternoon, Denver police said. The officer and others were responding to a call about a person on a porch “that they did not belong at,” Division Chief Ron Thomas said at a 4 a.m. news conference Sunday. Officers were fired on as they approached the porch, Thomas said. However, it was unclear if officers made contact with the person before the shooting started. The suspect escaped during the aftermath of the shooting. Police shut down a several-block radius in Sunnyside and searched people’s yards with dogs. Several people were detained.

On Sunday, Mother’s Day, the NRA posted a photo of pint-sized gun influencer Autumn Fry with her mother, who appeared to be holding an AR-15, a favorite among the nation’s most notorious mass shootings. “Mama didn’t raise a victim” is splayed across the photo with the following caption: “Happy Mother’s Day to all NRA moms! On top of the millions of other jobs moms have, NRA moms fight for our right to self-defense, while also defending themselves, their families, and communities. We are forever grateful for these fierce women.” Meanwhile, on Mother’s Day alone, there were at least 79 shootings tracked by the Gun Violence Archive, resulting in dozens of injuries and deaths. One of the most grisly was a mass shooting at a birthday party in Colorado. From the New York Times, emphasis ours: The police said that a birthday party was being held for one of the victims in a home in the park and that “friends, family and children were gathered inside” when the shooting occurred. The gunman, who was not publicly identified, was “a boyfriend of one of the female victims,” the police said. He drove to the home, walked inside “and began shooting people at the party before taking his own life,” the police said. The NRA relies on the myth that gun ownership makes women safer, and this incident of apparent intimate partner violence is exactly what the NRA would use as a rationale for why women should be armed to the teeth. It’s only a matter of time before gun nuts lament that all of this could have been avoided if only the women were carrying handguns (even though armed civilians are rarely successful at stopping active shooters). But there’s little evidence indicating that women are less likely to be harmed if they have a gun. There is, however, evidence that women who own guns are at higher risk of injury or death. From The Trace: Every credible scientific study of women and guns in the last two decades strongly indicates that a firearm in a woman’s home is far more likely to be used against her or her family than to defend against an outside attacker. Increasing gun ownership by women would only heighten that risk. The bottom-line statistic that most broadly assesses the relationship between women and firearms was determined by research conducted by the Department of Preventive Medicine at the University of Tennessee. That study, from 1997, concluded that the presence of a firearm in a woman’s home triples the odds that she will be killed. Usually, the person using a gun against a woman — contrary to Ted Cruz’s assertions — is not a stranger, but someone she knows, frequently an intimate partner. As The Trace previously noted, an average of 554 American women are fatally shot by romantic partners every year. That works out to a domestic violence gun homicide with a female victim once every 16 hours. Knowing how to use a gun properly is a skill that, I’d argue, everyone should have, whether they own a firearm or not. In a country riddled with them, it doesn’t hurt to know how to use one safely. Still, the idea that victims of gun violence, as the NRA’s Instagram post suggests, were raised by ineffectual parents who were uninterested in teaching their children how to defend themselves is absurd. Whether you’re a highly trained civilian, or a small child indulging in rapid-fire rounds for Instagram likes, if the last few decades of gun violence and mass shootings in American have taught us anything, it’s that it’s alarmingly easy to become another statistic. I’m struck by the similarities between the spin put on gun violence and that put on rape culture. The right always leans on this bogeyman stranger intending to do harm to you and your family rather than the inconvenient truth that violence is more often perpetrated by the devils we know.",2021-05-10 11:35:00,"Hey NRA, Here's Approximately How Many Shootings Happened in the U.S. On Mother's Day",,6154,http://jezebel.com

When a man walked into a birthday party full of family and friends in Colorado Springs, Colorado, this weekend and opened fire, he killed seven people, including himself and his girlfriend, according to police. While the police investigation into the massacre is still ongoing, the shooting so far appears to be one more link in the chain between domestic violence and mass shootings. Mass shootings are often portrayed as acts of random violence, where a man—it’s usually a man—opens fire in a public space and kills several strangers. But study after study has uncovered a common thread between mass shootings: The men who commit them often have a history of domestic violence and tend to target a partner or family member. None of the children at the party, which took place at a mobile home park, were hurt. All of the victims were members of the same extended family, one partygoer who left early told the Denver Post. They’d spent the party watching a boxing match and eating cakes shaped like piñatas. The 911 call didn’t come until after midnight. The gunman’s name still hasn’t been released. “It’s just crazy, it’s not what we expected on Mother’s Day,” the partygoer, Freddy Marquez, said. “I’m at a loss for words.” In at least 54 percent of all mass shootings between 2008 and 2019, the gunman shot a current or former partner or family member, Everytown for Gun Safety found in a 2020 report. (Everytown defines mass shootings as incidents where four or more people are shot and killed, excluding the perpetrator, as does the Gun Violence Archive.) The gunman had a known history of domestic abuse in at least 61 mass shootings. Although no children were killed in the Colorado Springs shooting, they’re particularly at risk in domestic violence-linked mass shootings. Seventy-two percent of the 309 children killed in mass shootings over the last decade died in such a shooting, Everytown found. “This happens, and it happens with alarming regularity. We often don’t even hear about it because in this country now it’s so common,” said Liza Gold, president of American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, who has written about the link between guns, domestic violence, and mass shootings. “It’s only the most sensational ones that we hear about. There’s nothing very sensational about a guy who kills his wife or maims his wife. It’s very distressing.” Like mass shootings, domestic abuse in general is deeply gendered: Nearly half of all women murdered in the U.S. are killed by their intimate partners, according to a 2017 report by the Centers for Disease Control (which was, for almost a quarter-century, banned from researching gun violence). Beyond the threat of violence they already faced, the coronavirus pandemic has engendered a potentially lethal combo for American women. Over the last year, as people huddled indoors to wait out COVID, gun sales spiked. At the same time, staying indoors is dangerous for people trapped in abusive homes and relationships. In April 2020, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline increased by 15 percent over April of the previous year. “This happens, and it happens with alarming regularity. We often don’t even hear about it because in this country now it’s so common.” The presence of guns alone can make domestic violence more deadly. Firearms are already used in more than half of all domestic violence homicides, according to a 2020 study published in the Journal of Academy of Psychiatry and the Law. That same study found that, in domestic violence situations, guns were associated with a 70 percent increase in the chance that there would be more than one victim. In a nationwide survey of more than 200 people who work with survivors of gender-based violence, such as shelter employees, about half said that “abusers threatening to shoot survivors has become a bigger problem since the start of the pandemic.” “I am very concerned that we’re just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg about the fallout—fallout in terms of violence of all kinds—related to the pandemic,” Gold said. “People have lost their jobs. They’re unemployed. There are more guns around even now than there were a year ago. People have been under much, much more stress. And there are a lot of very angry people.” Federal law does block anyone with a final domestic violence restraining order from having firearms. (A final restraining order arises at the end of a domestic violence case, meaning that there could be a long stretch of time where a suspected abuser can still get guns—and women who have recently left their partners face a higher risk of being murdered.) As of January 2021, 19 states and Washington, D.C. have enacted laws that let people file petitions to get guns out of the hands of people who may be a serious risk to themselves or others. But without solid enforcement, domestic abusers can slip through the cracks. After a gunman shot and killed 26 people in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas in 2017—after tying his wife to the bed—it emerged that the Air Force had failed to report the man’s conviction for assaulting his previous wife and stepson, on six separate occasions. That failure led him to be able to purchase the guns that he used to commit the massacre. “The connection between domestic violence and gun violence is undeniable and made all the more deadly because of this country’s extraordinarily lax gun laws,” Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, told VICE News in an email. “From closing the dating partner and background check loopholes to enacting red flag laws, we need federal action to protect women and end this gun violence epidemic that kills 100 people every day and wounds hundreds more.” There’s been nearly 200 mass shootings so far in 2021, according to the Gun Violence Archive. There was one at massage businesses in Atlanta, another at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. Colorado has already seen a mass shooting this year; just two months ago, a gunman’s grocery story rampage left 10 people dead.

At least 15 people died and 30 were wounded in those nine events, as Republicans continue to oppose even the most modest gun law reforms. U! S! A! Sorry, what else can we possibly say at that news? The only one of the weekend’s minimum of nine mass shootings to make widespread headlines was at a birthday party in Colorado. Six people were killed in that one, and the suspected shooter—believed to be the boyfriend of one of his victims—also killed himself. While it’s common for your smaller, home-based mass shootings to involve intimate partner relationships, so much so that many of those shootings don’t get a lot of media coverage, the birthday party angle garnered this one some attention. In other mass shootings, three were killed and one injured in Woodlawn, Maryland, in a bizarre incident that involved a man shooting and stabbing his neighbors, setting fire to his own home, and ultimately being shot and killed by police. Two people were killed and three injured in St. Louis County, Missouri, when a truck pulled up and bullets started flying. In Compton, California, two people were killed and two injured, while one person was killed and five were injured in a Los Angeles shooting. One person was killed and at least seven were wounded in an altercation at a Phoenix hotel. Four people were injured in each of three mass shootings, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Newark, New Jersey; and Citrus Heights, California. Truly, mass shootings are a complex and varied tapestry in these United States. Republicans used to allow new gun laws to pass without being filibustered. That's no longer true in an age where Republicans filibuster everything. President Joe Biden has issued executive orders cracking down on “ghost guns” and stabilizing devices that “effectively [turn] a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act.” But most action to reduce the number of mass shootings—and other shootings, for that matter—would require Congress, and as long as Republicans have the power to block anything, they will block this.

(AP) — A gunman opened fire at a birthday party in Colorado, slaying six adults before killing himself Sunday, police said. The shooting happened just after midnight in a mobile home park on the east side of Colorado Springs, police said. Officers arrived at a trailer to find six dead adults and a man with serious injuries who died later at a hospital, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. The suspected shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children. He walked inside and opened fire before shooting himself, police said. The birthday party was for one of the people killed, police said. Police on Sunday hadn’t released the identities of the shooter or victims. Authorities say a motive wasn’t immediately known. Children at the attack weren’t hurt and were placed with relatives. “My heart breaks for the families who have lost someone they love and for the children who have lost their parents,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement. It was Colorado’s worst mass shooting since a gunman killed 10 people at a Boulder supermarket March 22. “The tragic shooting in Colorado Springs is devastating,” Gov. Jared Polis said Sunday, “especially as many of us are spending the day celebrating the women in our lives who have made us the people we are today.” Colorado Springs, population 465,000, is Colorado’s second-biggest city after Denver. In 2015, a man killed three people, including a police officer, and injured eight others in a shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs.

Former Parkland student Cameron Kasky called out the media for its sudden shift on gun reform efforts during the Biden presidency after ""aiding"" such efforts during the Trump presidency. Kasky, who was a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglass High School where a horrific mass shooting left 17 dead in 2018, has been an outspoken advocate for gun reform.

WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKER CALLS OUT BIDEN'S SPIN ON DISAPPOINTING JOBS REPORT ""Right now, this very moment is a very complicated time for gun violence prevention activists because with Biden in the White House, the media does not want to aid us in demanding stronger gun reforms because whatever Joe Biden does is suddenly the right thing to do, Kasky said. ""When Donald Trump was the president, calling for an assault weapons ban and saying that the measures that he was putting in place were not nearly enough was a very popular opinion. Now if you're calling for an assault weapons ban, suddenly you're just an angry leftist who will never be happy with anything."" ""So that's kinda the case across the board with activists in this time of the Biden era. Anything that their administration is willing to do is the popular thing and if you ask for even a little bit more... well, now we're the bad guys because we're 'complaining too much,' we 'aren't happy enough with all the great things President Biden is giving us.'

Jerilee Bennett  DENVER — A shooting at a birthday party inside a trailer park home in Colorado Springs that killed six people before the gunman took his own life stunned a state weary of gun violence just weeks after another Colorado mass shooting killed 10 people. Police on Monday were investigating what led the gunman, who they said was the boyfriend of one of the victims, to walk into the crowded party early Sunday and open fire. Six adults were killed at the home at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado’s second-largest city, and a seventh died at a hospital, authorities said. The shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children, police said. Authorities didn’t release the names of the victims, gunman or disclose a possible motive. Nor did they release any further details on what weapon or weapons were used. Officials were still in the process of identifying the victims, Sandy Wilson of the El Paso County Coroner’s Office said Monday. A mobile crime lab was parked Monday outside the home, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape as officers guarded the scene. “My heart breaks for the families who have lost someone they love and for the children who have lost their parents,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said in a statement. The attack follows a series of mass shootings across the U.S. this year, including one on March 22 at a crowded supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer. The gunman in that attack faces multiple charges including first-degree murder. He has yet to enter a plea pending a mental health evaluation requested by his public defenders. A neighbor, Yenifer Reyes, told The Denver Post that she woke to the sound of gunfire and later saw police escorting children who were “crying hysterically” from the home. The children weren’t hurt in the attack and have been placed with relatives, police said. The first fire crews to respond to the shooting were told to stay back because of possible gunfire — then given an all-clear to approach the home an agonizing eight minutes after the initial dispatch, according to a recording of a Colorado Springs dispatch call. As the magnitude of the shooting became clearer, the first on the scene requested more ambulances and engine crews. Sirens are heard in the background as responders at the scene request more help. “Engine 11, sounds like more shots are still being fired – keep your distance,” a dispatcher says at one point. Twenty seconds later the engine crew responds: “Looking like we have multiple victims,” and asks for more ambulances. The dispatcher requests another engine to “2828 Preakness Way, possible multiple gunshot victims.” More than eight minutes in, the dispatcher says that “police on scene are advising that there are four victims and that you are clear to go in.” Soon thereafter, Engine 11 requests another ambulance; 13 minutes in the dispatcher says: “The sergeant on the scene is saying that medical is cleared to enter for all six patients. ... They’re saying we have six.” The attack was the latest mass killing — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year. Before the Colorado Springs shooting, a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University showed there had been at least 11 mass shootings since Jan. 1, compared to just two public mass shootings in 2020. Colorado Springs saw a 2015 attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic that killed three people, including a police officer, and injured eight others. Earlier that year, a man shot three people to death at random before dying in a shootout with police. In 2007, a man killed two people and wounded three at Colorado Springs’ New Life Church before taking his own life. Earlier the same day, he’d killed two people and injured two at a Youth With a Mission Center in the Denver suburb of Arvada. Colorado also suffered the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that killed 13 people before the two student attackers took their own lives, and the 2012 massacre at the Aurora movie theater that killed 12 people and injured 70. After the Boulder shooting, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to create a state “Office of Gun Violence Prevention” to educate residents about gun safety and collect data on Colorado gun violence. Other bills advancing through the Democrat-led Legislature would tighten background checks and allow municipalities greater freedom to adopt their own gun control laws that are stricter than state law.

295,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/10/colorado-police-hunt-for-motive-in-deadly-party-shooting/,"Trending: By Thomas Piepert, James Anderson and Colleen Slevin | Associated Press COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — A shooting at a birthday party inside a trailer park home in Colorado Springs that killed six people before the gunman took his own life stunned a state weary of gun violence just weeks after another Colorado mass shooting killed 10 people. Police on Monday were investigating what led the gunman, who they said was the boyfriend of one of the victims, to walk into the crowded party early Sunday and open fire. Six adults were killed at the home at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado’s second-largest city, and a seventh died at a hospital, authorities said. The shooter was the boyfriend of a female victim at the party attended by friends, family and children, police said. Authorities didn’t release the names of the victims, gunman or disclose a possible motive. Nor did they release any further details on what weapon or weapons were used. Officials were still in the process of identifying the victims, Sandy Wilson of the El Paso County Coroner’s Office said Monday. The attack follows a series of mass shootings across the U.S. this year, including one on March 22 at a crowded supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer. The gunman in that attack faces multiple charges including first-degree murder. He has yet to enter a plea pending a mental health evaluation requested by his public defenders. A mobile crime lab was parked early Monday outside the Colorado Springs home, which was cordoned off by yellow police tape as officers guarded the scene. By midafternoon the tape was gone; a sign stood in front of the home advertising “Grief Support, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,” at the mobile home park office. A small crowd of mourners arrived to pay their respects, leaving bouquets of yellow roses and devotional candles on a small table they set up in front of the home. They silently gazed, then left without comment under a dark, gray sky and blustering winds. Someone closed a partially open window in the home from the outside. Gladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, tearfully recalled the home’s owner, whom she identified as Joana, as a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors, ask how they were doing, and brag about her children. “She was an incredibly pleasant woman, very beautiful, happy all the time,” Bustos said. “She loved to chat. And she was very proud of her family.” The gunfire that startled Bustos from her sleep early Sunday had forever changed what she described as a safe and welcoming neighborhood. “We’re all in shock,” she said. “How can this happen here? This is all so painful, so devastating, so overwhelming.” Another neighbor, Yenifer Reyes, told The Denver Post that she woke to the sound of gunfire and later saw police escorting children who were “crying hysterically” from the home. The children weren’t hurt in the attack and have been placed with relatives, police said. The first fire crews to respond to the shooting were told to stay back because of possible gunfire — then given an all-clear to approach the home an agonizing eight minutes after the initial dispatch, according to a recording of a Colorado Springs dispatch call. As the magnitude of the shooting became clearer, the first on the scene requested more ambulances and engine crews. Sirens are heard in the background as responders at the scene request more help. “Engine 11, sounds like more shots are still being fired — keep your distance,” a dispatcher says at one point. Twenty seconds later the engine crew responds: “Looking like we have multiple victims,” and asks for more ambulances. The dispatcher requests another engine to “2828 Preakness Way, possible multiple gunshot victims.” More than eight minutes in, the dispatcher says that “police on scene are advising that there are four victims and that you are clear to go in.” Soon thereafter, Engine 11 requests another ambulance; 13 minutes in the dispatcher says: “The sergeant on the scene is saying that medical is cleared to enter for all six patients. … They’re saying we have six.” The attack was the latest mass killing — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year.

299,https://www.alternet.org/2021/05/mass-shootings-in-us/,"If a mass shooting is defined as an event where four or more people are shot, not counting the shooter, well, there were at least nine of those in the United States over the past weekend. At least 15 people died and 30 were wounded in those nine events, as Republicans continue to oppose even the most modest gun law reforms. U! S! A! Sorry, what else can we possibly say at that news? The only one of the weekend's minimum of nine mass shootings to make widespread headlines was at a birthday party in Colorado. Six people were killed in that one, and the suspected shooter—believed to be the boyfriend of one of his victims—also killed himself. While it's common for your smaller, home-based mass shootings to involve intimate partner relationships, so much so that many of those shootings don't get a lot of media coverage, the birthday party angle garnered this one some attention. In other mass shootings, three were killed and one injured in Woodlawn, Maryland, in a bizarre incident that involved a man shooting and stabbing his neighbors, setting fire to his own home, and ultimately being shot and killed by police. Two people were killed and three injured in St. Louis County, Missouri, when a truck pulled up and bullets started flying. In Compton, California, two people were killed and two injured, while one person was killed and five were injured in a Los Angeles shooting. One person was killed and at least seven were wounded in an altercation at a Phoenix hotel. Four people were injured in each of three mass shootings, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Newark, New Jersey; and Citrus Heights, California. Truly, mass shootings are a complex and varied tapestry in these United States. Republicans used to allow new gun laws to pass without being filibustered. That's no longer true in an age where Republicans filibuster everything. President Joe Biden has issued executive orders cracking down on ""ghost guns"" and stabilizing devices that ""effectively [turn] a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act."" But most action to reduce the number of mass shootings—and other shootings, for that matter—would require Congress, and as long as Republicans have the power to block anything, they will block this.   So do we. The past year has been the most arduous of our lives. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to be catastrophic not only to our health - mental and physical - but also to the stability of millions of people.

But when paramedics stepped inside the mobile home at approximately 12:29 a.m., they realized they didn’t need more lifesaving help, according to recorded radio traffic. Six of the seven people shot were already dead. “I don’t think we’re going to need all these additional resources that are coming,” one firefighter said over the radio at about 12:36 a.m. Colorado Springs police released no new details about the attack Monday as they continued to investigate what might have motivated the shooter to walk into a family’s birthday party and kill his girlfriend, five family members and then himself. Investigators plan to hold a news conference on the case Tuesday afternoon. “We know there are still a lot of questions into what exactly happened, why it happened and all the details in between,” Colorado Springs police officials wrote in a tweet. “Our investigators, detectives and victim advocates are determinedly working to find those answers.” As the names of those killed became more widely known Monday, family and friends began to publicly mourn the victims. “Today I lost my mother… brothers… and my sister-in-law,” Esmeralda Gutierrez wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “I ask everyone to keep my family in (their) prayers today as we go through this difficult time.” A longtime family friend, Alisha Morales, on Monday identified those who died as husband and wife Melvin and Mayra Perez, and Melvin’s brother, Jose Gutierrez. The men’s mother, Joana Cruz, also was killed, as well as Mayra’s siblings, Sandra Ibarra and Jose Ibarra, Morales confirmed. She did not identify the shooter. None of the dead have been publicly identified by the El Paso County coroner. Morales’ plea on Facebook for donations to pay for six funerals raised more than $13,000 from nearly 200 people. Family members of the victims could not be reached for comment Monday, but friends and coworkers remembered the victims as kindhearted and positive people. Sandra Ibarra was a mother and an assertive, independent woman, said Estephany Perez, a friend who met Ibarra about six years ago when they both worked at Five Guys. Ibarra rarely discussed challenges in her life and was a positive person, Perez said. “I think Sandra really just wanted peace in her life,” Perez said. Perez also knew Jose Ibarra, Sandra’s brother, as they both attended Mitchell High School. Jose Ibarra was an outgoing person beloved by all in the school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, she said. Another of those slain, Mayra Perez, worked for Reynolds Roofing Systems, the company said in a statement. “Mayra was a great employee and a friend,” owner Todd Reynolds wrote on the Facebook fundraiser. He declined to comment further Monday, but in the statement, the company said Mayra Perez was a “dedicated mother and good person.” “It’s a tragic and unnecessary loss of life,” the statement said. Sunday’s attack was the second mass shooting in Colorado in two months, coming just weeks after a gunman killed 10 people in a Boulder grocery store — another attack where first responders prepared for an onslaught of wounded survivors that never came.

Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said Monday that the mass shooting over the weekend at a birthday party inside a mobile home appeared to be the result of domestic violence, a report said. The Colorado Springs Gazette reported that there are still many unknowns about the shooting that left seven dead, including the gunman who was believed to be the boyfriend of one of the female victims. The paper reported that Suthers told KKTV, its news partner, that it seems that the shooting was not a ""domestic terrorism incident."" ""It appears to be domestic violence…that there was a relationship here that the perpetrator was involved in, and unfortunately, we had a lot of bystanders who got killed,"" he said. Police say the suspect ""drove to the residence, walked inside and began shooting people at the party before taking his own life,"" adding that ""friends, family, and children were gathered inside the trailer to celebrate when the shooting occurred."" Suthers told KKTV that the only time that there were so many victims in a killing in the city occurred during an ax murder in 1911. Police say the names of the suspect and victims will be released after a coroner has confirmed their identities and cause of death. There were children at the birthday party who were not targeted.

304,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/neighbors-mourn-victims-colorado-shooting-killed-77615629,"Police say a man who fatally shot six people at a Colorado birthday party before killing himself was upset after not being invited to the weekend gathering thrown by his girlfriend’s family COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- A man who fatally shot six people at a Colorado birthday party before killing himself was upset after not being invited to the weekend gathering thrown by his girlfriend’s family, police said Tuesday, calling the shooting an act of domestic violence. The shooter, 28-year-old Teodoro Macias, had been in a relationship with one of the victims, 28-year-old Sandra Ibarra, for about a year and had a history of controlling and jealous behavior, Colorado Springs police Lt. Joe Frabbiele said at a news conference. Police said there were no reported incidents of domestic violence during the relationship and that the shooter didn't have a criminal history. No protective orders were in place. “At the core of this horrific act is domestic violence,” Police Chief Vince Niski said, adding that the gunman had “displayed power and control issues” in the relationship. About a week before the shooting, there was another family gathering where there “was some sort of conflict” between the family and Macias, Niski said. The other victims of the shooting early Sunday were Ibarra’s extended family. They were         identified as Melvin Perez, 30; Mayra Ibarra de Perez, 33; Joana Cruz, 52; Jose Gutierrez, 21; and Jose Ibarra, 26. Investigators don’t know yet how the shooter got the weapon, which Frabbiele described as a Smith & Wesson handgun. He said it was originally purchased by someone else in 2014 at a local gun store but was not reported stolen. The gunman had two 15-round magazines, one of which was empty, and police recovered 17 spent shells at the scene. The shooting occurred at a home in the Canterbury Mobile Home Park on the east side of Colorado’s second-largest city. Three children at the party, ages 2, 5 and 11, were not hurt. Two families were celebrating the birthdays of family members, and 10 people were inside the home when the gunman arrived “and shot all six victims in quick succession” before turning the gun on himself, Frabbiele said. The children inside were in “close proximity” to the shots fired, he said. Police received the first of three 911 calls from inside the home. Another was made by an adult who managed to escape. Three teenagers had left the party just before the shooting, Frabbiele said. They returned shortly after to discover what happened. Arriving officers found Jose Gutierrez gravely wounded inside; he told the officers the suspect was in the home, Frabbiele said. Gutierrez died later at a hospital. “One of the smaller children and some of the teenagers lost both parents,” Frabbiele said. Police say the families of the victims had requested privacy. “In Colorado, we’ve had domestic terrorism incidents where lots of people were killed, we’ve had random acts like going into a King Soopers or a movie theater, but let’s not forget about the lethality of domestic violence,” Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said. Suthers was referring to a March 22 attack on a King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people, including a police officer, and a 2012 shooting at a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora that killed 12 and injured 70. “What we have here is a situation where all these people were together and (we) apparently had the anger directed at the adults and his partner. And the tragic consequences are unfathomable. We’ve got children orphaned by this situation,” Suthers said. Gladis Bustos, who lives three homes away, had tearfully identified the home’s owner as Joana on Monday. Bustos called her a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors and brag about her children. Colorado Springs police say eight of 15 homicides this year, including Sunday's victims, were related to domestic violence. Last year, nine of 39 homicides were tied to domestic violence. The weekend attack follows a series of mass shootings — defined as four or more dead, not including the shooter — to plague the U.S. this year. Before the Colorado Springs shooting, a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University showed there had been at least 11 mass shootings since Jan. 1, compared with just two public mass shootings in 2020. After the Boulder shooting, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to create a state Office of Gun Violence Prevention to educate residents about gun safety and collect data on Colorado gun violence. Other bills advancing through the Democratic-led Legislature would tighten background checks, allow municipalities greater freedom to adopt gun control laws that are stricter than state law, and require a person facing a protection order related to domestic violence to report what firearms they possess. ——— Associated Press writers James Anderson and Patty Nieberg in Denver contributed to this report. ——— This story has been corrected to show that Colorado Springs police Lt. Joe Frabbiele's last name was misspelled and that one of the children at the party, as well as some teenagers, were orphaned, not that all of the children were orphaned. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-11 01:07:16,Neighbors mourn victims of Colorado shooting that killed 7,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

306,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/11/world/europe/russia-school-shooting.html,"Advertisement Supported by Within hours of the shooting in Kazan, a provincial capital, President Vladimir V. Putin said he had ordered a tightening of Russia’s already restrictive laws on civilian ownership of guns. By Andrew E. Kramer MOSCOW — Gunfire and explosions erupted at a school in central Russia on Tuesday, killing seven students and two school employees, according to witnesses and officials who blamed a teenager for the rare mass shooting in the country. Within hours, President Vladimir V. Putin said he had ordered a tightening of Russia’s already restrictive laws on civilian gun ownership, a move that is likely to be implemented in the country’s top-down political system. “The thing is that firearms, which are used as assault rifles and similar weapons in certain countries, are sometimes registered as hunting guns,” said the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov. “The Russian National Guard will urgently consider the issue.” In a scene of mayhem captured on cellphone videos, students jumped from windows and ran as shots rang out, and the police and ambulances raced to the school in Kazan, a provincial capital about 450 miles east of Moscow. Students and teachers in the school’s upper floors barricaded themselves in classrooms and waited for help, said Vyacheslav Yegoshin, a 15-year-old who witnessed the shooting from outside the building because he was late for school Tuesday. “It was scary, and everybody was crying,” Mr. Yegoshin said in a telephone interview. A regional governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, said seven students, one teacher and an employee of the school whose job he did not specify, had died and more than 20 people were wounded. The wounded ranged in age from 7 to 62. State media reported that two students had died from the fall after leaping from upper-floor windows. Mr. Minnikhanov said a 19-year-old suspect was in custody. Ria, a state news agency, published a video of a young man it said was the suspect, bound by his hands and feet to the bars of a cell while talking to an investigator. He appeared agitated and incoherent, saying he realized two months ago that “I hate everybody.” The video could not be independently confirmed. Russia has strict gun ownership laws. Applicants for a firearm’s license must pass psychological exams and own a smoothbore shotgun for a trial period before obtaining a rifle. Pistol ownership is more tightly controlled, largely limited to those, such as retiring military officers, who are given a pistol as an award for their service. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin ordered the head of the agency regulating gun ownership, the Russian National Guard, to draft new rules. The order asked for a “swift working out of new positions about the types of weapons that can be in civilian circulation, can be in the hands of the population,” Mr. Peskov said. A member of Russia’s Parliament, Aleksandr Khinshtein, said the attacker had obtained a gun license on April 28 for a semiautomatic shotgun. The Russian federal government sent a plane from Moscow with medics and psychologists to help treat children in the school, called Gymnasium No. 175, which accommodates grades one to 11. The health and education ministers also flew to Kazan. In interviews with Russian media, students described a harrowing ordeal. One recalled cowering behind desks while shots rang out in the corridor and somebody — presumably the shooter — knocked loudly on the locked door of a classroom. The students got a second scare when the police arrived and also knocked on the door. An officer convinced the students it was safe by sliding his badge under the door. Pictures posted on social media, described as scenes taken after the shooting, showed doors torn from their frames and debris littering the hallways. It was not clear whether the doors had been ripped out during the attack or during the security service operation against the shooter. In the most recent similar mass shooting — in 2018 at a college in Kerch, a town in Russian-occupied Crimea — 21 people were killed and 50 were wounded. Other less lethal incidents in schools and colleges have followed, including several attacks with air guns and an ax attack in Ulan-Ude, a city in Siberia, that wounded a teacher. In response, Nikolai Patrushev, the director of Russia’s National Security Council, in 2019 blamed unrestricted access to the internet for children, saying that it “destructively influences the consciousness and behavior of students” by exposing them to violent content. Mr. Putin did not immediately call for stricter gun laws after the earlier shootings. Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting.

With an announcement perhaps uncharacteristically low-key for the infamous shock shite, LiveLeak co-founder Hayden Hewitt stated that the online video platform had outlived its purpose and cited changes in the internet landscape as one of the reasons for closure. ""We felt LiveLeak had achieved all that it could and it was time for us to try something new and exciting,"" said Hayden Hewitt in a blog post. ""The world has changed a lot over these last few years, the Internet alongside it, and we as people."" LiveLeak's bread and butter was predominantly video content that was barred from streaming on other sites. More popular and increasingly-family-friendly platforms such as YouTube have rather rigid terms of service.The site was known for platforming footage of mass shootings, terrorist beheadings and general acts of violence. Perhaps most famously,  the site hosted footage of the Christchurch mass shooting, which resulted in New Zealand blocking access to the site in 2019. As reported byThe Verge , LiveLeak has been substituted by a different video site with the name ItemFix. The new website does not allow violent content. Defenders of LiveLeak's open display of violent content have highlighted the site's dedication to journalism and awareness of political strife across the globe. Born in an era of shock sites, LiveLeak became synonymous with upsetting videos and gore. But despite the creators' staunch ideals, the site did make some compromises in light of massive controversy.The site saw unprecedented amount of attention in 2014 after a video of the ISIS beheading of James Foley was uploaded to the site.  While the video did not show the details of the beheading, it did show the moments immediately following the execution. In response, the site publicly announced that they would no longer host videos produced by IS. While the content turned off many internet users, LiveLeak had a similar amount of traffic as sites such as The Onion and Jezebel, as reported by The Verge.  If you're checking in to see what's going on with LL please take a look at this link:https://t.co/qg1AbcEsIP It is currently unknown whether new sites will emerge to replace LiveLeak, or if its many users will instead flock to pre-existing platforms. Much of the site's content will presumably be accessable elsewhere on the internet, and much of LiveLeak's content that doesn't break ItemFix's terms of service will migrate to the new platform.   If you want to know what's happened to LiveLeak please check this link. Cheers.https://t.co/21gJaau7PB As a final farewell to LiveLeak's community, Hewitt spoke fondly of the visitors and uploaders that existed during the site's tenure.  “To the members, the uploaders, the casual visitors, the trolls and the occasionally demented people who have been with us. You have been our constant companions and although we probably didn’t get to communicate too often you’re appreciated more than you realize,” he wrote. “On a personal level you have fascinated and amused me with your content.

308,https://abcnews.go.com/International/dead-school-shooting-russia/story?id=77617468,"A gunman opened fire at a school in the Russian city of Kazan. At least 8 killed in Russian school shooting MOSCOW -- At least seven children and two adults have been killed and around 20 more injured in a mass shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan. A gunman attacked school no. 175 in the city, about 500 miles east of Moscow, on Tuesday morning while hundreds of children were in classes. Armed with a semi-automatic shotgun and explosives, the attacker forced his way into the building and made his way to classrooms and opened fire on eight graders there, according to police. Heavily armed police stormed the school and detained the alleged shooter, identified as a 19-year-old man. Videos from the scene showed terrified children trying to flee the school building, with some jumping out of high windows as the sound of gun shots rang out. Emergency services helped others to climb down ladders. Other videos showed children lying in grass near the school covered in blood. ""It's a great tragedy. We have lost seven children -- four boys, three girls. They died here on the third floor,"" Tatarstan's president, Rustam Minnikhanov, told reporters standing outside the school following the shooting. He said two female teachers at the school were also killed. The seven children killed were eighth graders. At least 21 people were hospitalized, 18 of them children, and six are in critical condition, according to regional health authorities. Most of the children are between the ages of 7 and 15. Children at the school described to Russian media how they locked themselves in their classrooms on the third floor after hearing explosions and gunfire. In several accounts, students said the gunman tried to break down the doors to get to them. ""He sort of started to smash the door,"" a pupil, identified as Adelya, told the Russian news site Media.Zona. ""Then the police came into the corridor. He ran and started shooting, and a bullet hit our door."" Authorities identified the attacker as Ilnaz Galyaviyev, a resident of Kazan and according to local media a former pupil at the school. There were early conflicting reports suggesting two gunmen were present at the attack, but local authorities have since said he acted alone. Russian media have found a channel on the Telegram messenger purportedly created by the alleged shooter a few days before the attack. In photos posted on the channel, a man poses in a long, dark coat and a mask with the word ""God"" written in Russian on it. In the posts, the alleged gunman refers to himself as a ""god"" and threatened mass killings in the near future. After police said they had detained the shooter, local media posted a video purporting to show Galyaviyev's interrogation by police. In the video, a young man, shirtless and tied by his arms and legs to a cage, screams at an officer that he has realised he ""is a god"" and that he ""hates everyone."" Galyaviyev until last month was a student at a college in Kazan but dropped out in April, the college told the Russian news site, RBC. He graduated from the school four years ago and had been studying programming at the college. Russian officials said that Galyaviyev obtained a gun license last month, using it to buy the semi-automatic shotgun used in the attack. Although in recent years there have been a series of deadly attacks at schools by students in Russia, mass school shootings of the sort seen in the United States are rare and this is already one of the most deadly. In 2018, an 18-year-old killed 20 people and injured dozens more before killing himself at a school in Kerch in Crimea. President Vladimir Putin expressed condolences to the victims on Monday and immediately ordered authorities to tighten up gun regulations. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had ordered the head of Russia's National Guard that oversees gun ownership to develop new rules for the type of weapons civilians are permitted to possess. Peskov said the change was needed to address to assault weapons sometimes being improperly classed as hunting rifles. Following Putin's order, Russia's National Guard quickly said it would develop new rules in coordination with other government bodies and the head of Russia's parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said it would meet next week to discuss measures for tougher controls, including ensuring stricter background checks. Volodin also said the parliament should discuss whether anonymity on the internet now ought to be restricted. Tatiana Moskalkova, Russia's human rights ombudswoman, called for the age for purchasing firearms to be raised from 18 to 21, except for those with military experience. Russia has fairly tough gun laws, requiring potential owners to take classes and pass a series of tests, including medical and psychological examinations, before they can receive a license to buy smoothbore guns, such as shotguns. To buy a rifle requires another five-year waiting period following that. After the 2018 Kerch school shooting, Putin also ordered the National Guard to tighten firearm rules. But since then, proposed plans -- including to have gun owners inform the guard of their location within three days if they travel with their weapons -- have stalled and little has changed, according to the Russian news sites Meduza and Kommersant. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-11 07:48:49,At least 8 dead in school shooting in Russia,"education and schools,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

But when paramedics stepped inside the mobile home at approximately 12:29 a.m., they realized they didn’t need more lifesaving help, according to recorded radio traffic. Six of the seven people shot were already dead. “I don’t think we’re going to need all these additional resources that are coming,” one firefighter said over the radio at about 12:36 a.m. Colorado Springs police released no new details about the attack Monday as they continued to investigate what might have motivated the shooter to walk into a family’s birthday party and kill his girlfriend, five family members and then himself. Investigators plan to hold a news conference on the case Tuesday afternoon. “We know there are still a lot of questions into what exactly happened, why it happened and all the details in between,” Colorado Springs police officials wrote in a tweet. “Our investigators, detectives and victim advocates are determinedly working to find those answers.” As the names of those killed became more widely known Monday, family and friends began to publicly mourn the victims. “Today I lost my mother… brothers… and my sister-in-law,” Esmeralda Gutierrez wrote on Facebook on Sunday. “I ask everyone to keep my family in (their) prayers today as we go through this difficult time.” A longtime family friend, Alisha Morales, on Monday identified those who died as husband and wife Melvin and Mayra Perez, and Melvin’s brother, Jose Gutierrez. The men’s mother, Joana Cruz, also was killed, as well as Mayra’s siblings, Sandra Ibarra and Jose Ibarra, Morales confirmed. She did not identify the shooter. None of the dead have been publicly identified by the El Paso County coroner. Morales’ plea on Facebook for donations to pay for six funerals raised more than $13,000 from nearly 200 people. Family members of the victims could not be reached for comment Monday, but friends and coworkers remembered the victims as kindhearted and positive people. Sandra Ibarra was a mother and an assertive, independent woman, said Estephany Perez, a friend who met Ibarra about six years ago when they both worked at Five Guys. Ibarra rarely discussed challenges in her life and was a positive person, Perez said. “I think Sandra really just wanted peace in her life,” Perez said. Perez also knew Jose Ibarra, Sandra’s brother, as they both attended Mitchell High School. Jose Ibarra was an outgoing person beloved by all in the school’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, she said. Another of those slain, Mayra Perez, worked for Reynolds Roofing Systems, the company said in a statement. Related Articles

""At the core of this horrendous act is domestic violence. The suspect who was in a relationship with one of the victims displayed power and control issues,"" Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said. ""When he wasn’t invited to a family gathering, the suspect responded by opening fire and killing six victims before taking his own life."" Seven adults and three children – 2, 5 and 11 – were present during the shooting, Lt. Joe Frabbiele said. The children were unharmed and ""were in close proximity to the shooting event"" and witnessed what happened ""to some degree,"" he said. ""We’ve got children orphaned by this situation,"" Niski said. The victims were identified as Sandra Ibarra-Perez, 28; Jose Ibarra, 26; Mayra Ibarra De Perez, 33; Melvin Perez, 30; Jose Gutierrez, 21; and Joana Cruz, 52. Mayra Ibarra De Perez and Melvin Perez were married and present with their children, police said. Mayra's siblings Sandra and Jose were also present. The party was at the home of Melvin’s mother, Joana Cruz, and stepfather. Joana’s son, Jose Gutierrez, was present. The shooter – Teodoro Macias, 28 – entered the home and shot all six victims ""in quick succession"" before shooting himself, Frabbiele said. Police received three 911 calls, including one from a neighbor, one from inside the residence capturing the sound of ""rapid gunfire"" and one from a family member who escaped the residence. 'Unspeakable acts': Gunman kills 6, then self, at birthday party in Colorado Springs, Colorado, police say Three teenagers – 16, 16 and 18 – had left the gathering at the time to get something at a neighbor's house, Frabbiele said. ""They returned to the residence to discover what happened prior to police arrival. They attempted to render aid and gave shelter to the younger children,"" Frabbiele said. Five victims and the gunman died on the scene, and a sixth victim – Jose Gutierrez – was taken to the hospital for ""advanced lifesaving efforts."" He died at the hospital, Frabbiele said. One young child and ""some"" teenagers lost both parents, Niski said. The children are now with relatives. Police found one firearm, a Smith and Wesson 9mm semi-automatic pistol, and two 15-round magazines, Frabbiele said. One magazine was empty, and one was still loaded. Officers found 17 shell casings, he said. The gun was purchased from a dealer in 2014 at a local gun store, but the shooter did not buy the firearm during that transaction, Frabbiele said. The gun had not been reported stolen, and police were still investigating how the gunman came to possess it, he said. The shooting is the 13th mass killing this year and the second mass killing in Colorado this year, according to a USA TODAY, Northeastern University and The Associated Press database, which defines a mass killing as those in which four or more people were killed, not including the assailant. In March, 10 people were killed in Boulder when a gunman opened fire at a King Soopers grocery store. Columbine, Aurora and now Boulder: Colorado has the sixth-highest rate of public mass killings Niski said the Colorado Springs killing was the most shooting victims the city has ever seen and the fourth-most in Colorado. The incident shines a light on the lethality of domestic violence, he said. ""In Colorado, we've had domestic terrorism incidents where lots of people were killed. We've had random acts like going into a King Soopers or a movie theater. But let's not forget about the lethality of domestic violence,"" Niski said. ""Twenty to 25% of the victims of homicides related to domestic violence are not the people involved in the relationship."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, crime report data indicates about 1 in 5 homicide victims in the U.S. are killed by an intimate partner. Over half of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former male partner, the CDC says. Sandra Ibarra-Perez and the gunman had been in a relationship for about a year, police said. ""The suspect had a history of controlling and jealous behavior toward the victim. This behavior in particular was most obvious with trying to isolate her from her family, making efforts to prevent her from attending family events. Colorado Springs police said they had no previously reported incidents of domestic violence incidents in the relationship, and the victim did not have an order of protection. The gunman does not have a criminal history, Frabbiele said. 'How can this happen here?' Police seek motive after gunman kills 6, then self, at Colorado birthday party A small crowd of mourners Monday left bouquets of yellow roses and devotional candles on a small table set up in front of the home. Freddy Marquez told the Denver Post he was at the party before the shooting with his wife and children, and the victims were all of the same extended family. The party was to celebrate his wife's and her brother's birthdays, but Marquez said his family left around 10 p.m. because his wife had to work the next day. When his wife woke up the next morning, she saw numerous missed calls. Marquez's wife's mother, two brothers and three extended family members died. ""It’s just crazy; it’s not what we expected on Mother’s Day,"" he told the Post. ""I’m at a loss for words."" Neighbor Gladis Bustos told The Associated Press the home's owner, Joana, was a warmhearted, hardworking person who always took the time to say hello to her neighbors. ""She was an incredibly pleasant woman, very beautiful, happy all the time,"" Bustos told the Associated Press. ""She loved to chat. And she was very proud of her family."" ""We’re all in shock,"" she added. ""How can this happen here? This is all so painful, so devastating, so overwhelming."" Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers asked for patience during the investigation. Gov. Jared Polis offered condolences in a Sunday statement. ""The tragic shooting in Colorado Springs is devastating... Multiple lives were taken today by this terrible act of violence,"" he said in the statement. ""Families torn apart, and at a birthday party no less.""

Snyder, whose Peabody Award-winning 2016 documentary “Newtown” took her to Sandy Hook, Connecticut where 27 elementary school students and teachers died in a 2012 mass shooting, hadn’t planned to revisit the heart-wrenching topic of gun violence. But while in Florida for a different project, she stumbled onto a large group of Parkland teenagers on the steps of the Capitol in Tallahassee to demand action on guns and realized she could tell a different part of the story. “Underlying everything was this story of collective trauma,” Snyder says. “And starting to understand what this does to community, however you define community.” For “Newtown,” the story had focused on “adult grief and the collective trauma of one town and an event that kind of rocked the world,” she said. “But this felt like a different moment. I was there when all of these kids arrived from Parkland traumatized, angry, and demanding that something change. “And I really started to think that’s the one thing I didn’t really get to talk about in ‘Newtown’ — this nation of kids who are really directly affected.” The narrative of “Us Kids” unfolds on parallel tracks. Much of it follows the March For Our Lives movement that Parkland teens started after the shooting, and which led to a huge rally in Washington D.C. and then a summerlong bus tour across the country and back to raise awareness and activism to confront an epidemic of gun violence. The bus tour includes some of the most familiar faces of the Parkland movement, including David Hogg, a frequent voice on national television, and X González, whose passionate speech three days after the shooting provided the title of the film (“Us kids seem to be the only ones to notice and … to call B.S.”). And then there’s Fuentes. Still recovering from physical and mental injuries, she’s seen mostly in Florida, hanging out with the younger brother of a friend who died next to her in class, sharing fears and feelings of PTSD, and memorably getting sick to her stomach from stress and nerves during a speech to nearly a million protestors in Washington. “Sam represents to me the face of a nation of traumatized youth,” Snyder says. “And it was so important for me to give her a voice. “I built trust and established relationships with all of these kids,” she says. “But Sam, in particular, was a very special journey of building a relationship. “I think it was in particular because she was shot and had a different level of trauma that I had wanted to be extremely respectful of not retraumatizing her, and more than anything, make sure that the film felt that it was healing more than harmful.” Fuentes says she was wary after several bad experiences with news crews in the aftermath of the shooting but quickly saw Snyder’s intent was something different. “I had had so many really bitter experiences I felt like my story was just a marketing tactic to collect more views,” she says. “Very exploitative and not purposeful. Like there was nothing to be accomplished by retelling my story. “And when Kim approached me, we had just a shared idea about what we wanted to do,” Fuentes says. “That was to inspire and create change among young people, and really all people who watched the film. “It was supposed to be a tool. One that sheds light on the reality of what it means to be a survivor of gun violence while also turning that trauma into, you know, power, essentially.” In scenes from the bus tour, which included an event in Huntington Beach to protest donations from the gun lobby to then-U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the Parkland teens are seen at work: Researching gun laws and political contributions as they ride from city to city. Inviting teen advocates from cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee to join the bus tour. Holding serious, respectful conversations with pro-gun protestors outside their events. Snyder says she was constantly awed by their ability to do so much after their recent trauma. “They’re going outside of the town hall, approaching these guys with AR-15s in patient, civil dialogue,” she says. “It was like they felt the same as kids throughout time who’ve stepped up to be young revolutionaries in a sense, or young patriots, because the times call on them to do that.” The contrast between these kids, and others like them everywhere, and the lives of teenagers in the ’70s when Snyder was in high school was stark, she says. “I would look at them and think, ‘What was I doing after my senior year?’” Snyder says. “And, you know, I was waitressing with friends at the beach, and just being a kid excited about college. “And I would watch them and I understood, truly, the sacrifices of these kids that were on a bus, exhausted, eating fast food,” she says. “They would play when they could. Find a soccer ball or whatever. But they were doing their homework, rolling through the country, because they felt that this was what was needed.” Fuentes moved six months ago, encouraged in part by her enduring friendship with Snyder, to New York City where she works as a receptionist while figuring out her next move. In the film, she says at one point that before the shooting she saw her life as a straight path: college, a career as a teacher, retirement. Now, the plans of that Sam are no more. “At one time I was somebody who just strived for regular, for ordinary,” Fuentes says. “And excuse my French, but after you’ve had your life devastated, and there’s a moment where you could lose it all, you just kind of gain this ‘(bleep)-it’ mentality. “So why don’t you just pursue the things that make you happy and make you feel more fulfilled in your life, because you don’t know when your life is just going to come to a screeching halt,” she says. Now, as she continues to work on her physical and mental scars, Fuentes says she’s embracing her creativity. She sees music and writing and “being passionate about expression” as part of her future. She says her activism will also continue in the hope that her story can inspire others, which she believes happened to at least some who saw the film at Sundance. “I was basically sharing the most vulnerable parts of myself and my journey, and hoping that was going to inspire those who were also in the room,” she says of “Us Kids” and the film festival. “I wasn’t just hoping that people would walk away and be sad and pitiful for me, I wanted them to be inspired and to walk out and hopefully do something about it.” Snyder says that in her months with the Parkland kids she came to see that their anger, their passion, their dedication to the cause was in many ways born of the unwillingness to let their peers’ deaths be forgotten or in vain. Fuentes said much the same. “When people see this film I want them to be shook, I want them to be angry and upset, but I also want them to be inspired to do something different,” Fuentes says. “We are these kids who were shoved into the spotlight and, like, just expected to do the best under the worst circumstances. “And a lot of people have the privilege to not be in that circumstance,” she says. “A lot of people have the privilege to just get up and do something without being affected by it in the first place. “Ultimately, the message here is that I never want a single person to be affected by gun violence ever again, and that starts with people who are well and healthy and able to rally take a stance,” Fuentes says. “I want them to connect the pieces and learn from us.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

315,https://abcnews.go.com/US/victims-colorado-springs-birthday-party-shooting-identified/story?id=77623414,"The gunman was the boyfriend of one of the victims, according to authorities. Police identify 6 victims in Colorado Springs mass shooting Investigators say the suspect who killed six adults, including his girlfriend, and took his own life in front of young children at a Colorado Springs birthday party over the weekend was fueled by jealousy after he was not invited to the family gathering. The Colorado Springs Police Department identified the victims of Sunday's shooting as Melvin Perez, 30, Mayra Ibarra de Perez, 33, Jose Gutierrez-Cruz, 21, Joana Cruz, 52, Sandra Ibarra-Perez, 28, and Jose Ibarra, 26. Melvin Perez and Mayra Ibarra de Perez were married, and Joana Cruz was Melvin Perez and Jose Gutierrez-Cruz's mother, according to investigators. Sandra Ibarra-Perez and Jose Ibarra were Mayra Ibarra de Perez's siblings, police said. Lt. Joe Frabbiele told reporters at a news conference Wednesday that the suspect, Teodoro Macias, 28, had been dating Sandra Ibarra-Perez for a year and there was tension between him and her family following a get-together the previous week. The suspect became angry when he was not invited to the birthday party this Saturday and drove up to the mobile home where the gathering took place early Sunday morning night and opened fire, Frabbiele said. ""At the core of this horrendous act is domestic violence,” Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski told reporters. The shooting unfolded at the Canterbury Mobile Home Park after police were called to the scene around 12:18 a.m. Frabbiele said gunshots were heard on the 911 call. There were 10 family members in total inside of the home when the incident happened, according to police. One adult was unharmed, as were three children -- aged 2, 5 and 11 -- who were inside the home when Macias allegedly opened fire, the police said. The children ran into a bedroom to seek cover while the adult ran out to call 911, according to police. ""The evidence supports the children were in close proximity to the event and to some degree witnessed what happened,"" Frabbiele said. Three teen family members who attended the party were outside of the mobile home picking up an item from a neighbor when shots rang out and immediately returned to help the victims, Frabbiele said. One of the younger children and two of the teens lost a parent in the incident, he said. Jose Gutierrez-Cruz was still alive when officers responded to the scene, but he succumbed to his injuries at the hospital, police said. Officers found a Smith and Wesson semi-automatic handgun underneath Macias's body, Frabbiele said. Frabbiele said the investigation is ongoing, but police were able to determine the suspect's alleged motive based on interviews with family members and phone communications between the suspect and Sandra Ibarra-Perez. There were no previous reported domestic violence incidents between the two, but family members said he had a ""history of controlling and jealous behavior,"" including trying to prevent her from attending family events, according to police. Frabbiele said officers are also investigating the origins behind the weapon used in the shooting. Records show that the handgun was purchased in 2014 at a local dealer by another person, according to Frabbiele. ""The serial number on that firearm is not reported stolen,"" he said. Police said victims counseling resource staffers are with the surviving members. Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers called for patience as investigators searched for clues behind the killings, and he offered his condolences to the family. ""He had anger directed at the adults and his partner, and the tragic consequences are awful,"" Suthers said.

Filed under: Gangs of London’s stunning 24-minute shootout brings perspective to gun violence Darren Edwards, the son of a crime boss hailing from an itinerant community named the Welsh Travellers, unwittingly killed Finn Wallace, the underworld kingpin who united London’s criminal organizations into a steady truce. Now the truce is in shambles, and Darren is the most wanted man in London. That’s all you need to know to enjoy the sixth episode of AMC’s crime drama Gangs of London, a distressingly good hour of action TV that unfolds as a heavily armed kill-squad lays siege to Darren’s country home. The episode’s 24-minute shootout immediately earns a spot in the action canon for its shocking, audaciously staged violence. The sequence is also difficult to recommend: It’s nearly half an hour of unabated gun violence in a year where American gun violence has returned to the forefront of many people’s minds. In the first four months of 2021, there have been over 147 mass shootings in the United States, a numbing cadence of suffering that’s difficult to comprehend. In the United States, gun violence is as common as inclement weather, and more or less expected in our fiction. Cinematic shootouts, be it in big-budget movies or cop procedurals, often feel matter-of-fact — that’s just how good guys and bad guys fight. Then there are shootouts like the sort in Gangs of London, which, in its excess, conveys the queasy tension between the thrill of action cinema and the horror of guns in an unforgettable way. The sixth hour of Gangs of London isn’t typical for the show. After setting the events of the series in motion in a two-part premiere, Darren disappears from the plot, which largely follows the lowly Wallace family footsoldier Elliot Finch (Sope Dirisu) as he rises through the underworld ranks. Most of the nine-episode first season alternates between crime drama and brutal action, usually culminating in a brawl between Elliot and some other enforcer. Guns are present, and there are some particularly violent shootouts, but the set pieces at the center are typically choreographed with hand-to-hand combat. Arresting fight scenes are a hallmark for show co-creator and director Gareth Evans, who’s most famous for writing and directing The Raid and its sequel. In keeping with The Raid duology, Evans’ Gangs of London fights are sublime, bracing sequences that encourage viewers to cheer and wince in equal measure. Elliot’s fights are gruesome works of art; if there’s a blade or hard edge present in a scene, it will likely find gory purchase in a man’s flesh. The combat is also breathtaking. Evans is among the most compelling action filmmakers working today, employing camerawork that is just as kinetic as the fighters on-screen without sacrificing clarity. Watching one of Evans’ fight scene means feeling, deep in your bones, the danger of the violence, and how frail even the most capable fighter can be. Applying this ethos to a gunfight is what makes episode 6 so satisfying to me, even as my distaste for guns grows. In this 24-minute confrontation, guns are a nightmare. The first 30 minutes of episode 6 concentrates on two things: Darren’s malaise as he hides and waits for a boat to whisk him away to safety, and his father Kinney (Mark Lewis Jones) making a slow, painful journey to Darren’s hideout, looking for his son after surviving an armed assault by the Wallace family. Unfortunately, by the time Kinney gets there, so has a team of Danish assassins led by Leif Hanson (Mads Koudal), hired to kill Darren by yet another party. The second half of the episode kicks into high gear as Kinney arrives at the safe house with the assassins literally right behind him. The quiet farmhouse erupts into chaos. The most remarkable thing about the gunfight is how it’s a mess. The assassins are using clean military tactics and high-powered weaponry, but instead of the precision often associated with this level of militarism, Evans provides wanton destruction. The camera largely prefers the farmhouse over the assailants, and the peril of the people inside. Splintered wood, shattered glass, and sawdust fill the frame. The targets, attempting to find shelter, are disoriented, panicking as they try to find safety in a space overtaken by sound and fury. The sheer number of bullets striking objects in the frame is terrifying. The stakes and peril are clear: Every second Darren and his guardians stay alive is a goddamn miracle. And for the most part, they don’t survive. Suddenly and violently, they fall, despite putting up a valiant fight. Throughout this fight, there’s a story being told. This is how far Kinney was willing to go to save his son’s life. This is the wrath Darren did not seem to understand was being held at bay for his ungrateful hide. When the power structure of the world is upset, violence envelopes everyone. Gangs of London is a nihilistic story about power, one that largely depicts people wielding it for its own sake. A running thread fueling the show’s violence comes from Finn Wallace’s son, Sean, not knowing the difference between having power and feeling powerful. He acts rashly in favor of the latter, not seeming to recognize how his father’s death has provided him with the former, and how his revenge-fueled actions jeopardize the power he’s built. The other criminal organizations, smelling blood in the water, take advantage of the power vacuum to try and reshuffle the hierarchy and accrue more power by taking it from others. Gunfights are cinematic because they’re also about power. A gun takes a life, and easily. Introduce one in a scene full of people, and a line is drawn that the audience immediately understands. In a well-told story, a gun crystallizes every character’s relationship with the others: We understand who that weapon is threatening or protecting, and why. But modern cinematic gunfights are also remarkably clean affairs. Call it the John Wick effect: In this franchise, our hero assassin demonstrates complete mastery of a space, working every angle with hot lead and clean precision. His gun fights aren’t quite balletic, but they are like dance — shots are framed to make sure we understand a space well enough that when John Wick dramatically points a gun, a man is going to drop dead. And into this ballroom, one dance partner after another enters, all to fall at John’s feet. I like John Wick movies precisely because of this approach. Guns are almost beside the point, like an extension of the assassin’s martial-arts-like moves. The dance is what matters, establishing a baseline of respect for his many opponents. When someone clears that bar long enough to survive a few seconds in his company, we know they are dangerous, and the action elevates in response. The glibness of these gunfights is balanced out by the fiction; where nearly every character is a member of a secret order of assassins with comically elaborate rules to navigate. (Dance can be comedy, too.) Most gunfights, however, are neither dance nor horror. From run-of-the mill procedurals like NCIS to more elevated fare like Better Call Saul, they’re just there. Like air. They mean almost nothing, a mere inconvenience to the main characters. The series regulars will be fine and everyone knows it, while countless unnamed foes drop dead. This is true of most fiction (it would be very upsetting if most stories did not have their protagonists survive to the end), but when combined with the workmanlike, relatively bloodless presentation that’s a feature of most shootouts, guns take on an almost casual air. And at this point, I would barely notice their required presence in action films and TV shows, were it not for the horror of real-life gun violence always lingering at the edge of my mind. These shootouts are often so thoughtless that they become a good time to look away and scroll down Twitter — and thus, be reminded of the real-world nightmares guns like these inflict. As domestic shootings come faster than we can process them, and with meaningful reform seemingly off the table, gun violence has been increasingly referred to as an epidemic. It’s an American public health crisis with no end in sight, and no public recourse other than to just get used to it. The apathy toward action doesn’t send me recoiling from cinematic gun fights, but I’m forced to question them more. On a giant screen with booming sound, I am troubled by how casually present guns are. I think about their diminishing returns in entertainment, and my heart sinks in disgust and horror as those same diminishing returns are felt in real life, with each shooting met with less outrage than the last. Watching the bloody mayhem of Gangs of London crystallized something for me: If people in charge of keeping us safe in the real world don’t take guns seriously, then at the very least, maybe I need to demand that art does. This is not a call for every show or film with a gun to be a ponderous and realistic drama — Gangs of London, for all of its bullet-ridden bodies, can be quite cartoonish — but like anything a filmmaker chooses to put on a screen, they should always serve a purpose. In Gangs of London, that purpose is a blunt one: it portrays these weapons as ugly, horrible things that reduce us from people to meat. “We agreed that every death should be a tragedy,” director Gareth Evans said in a recent New York Times interview about his show’s central shootout, noting that even during the episode’s brutal siege, relationships between characters on both sides are made clear, and every loss causes someone anguish. I appreciate the frank ugliness of this approach, and its place in the story being told. It’s effective in the way that I want to see characters on screen beat the impossible odds, and stay alive a little bit longer. To continue the story. To be with other people. I want everyone to survive the nightmare of a loaded gun.

317,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/11/new-charges-reveal-santa-clara-county-jail-guards-didnt-intervene-in-mass-gang-beating-of-informant/,"Trending: Explosive new charges reveal that close to three-dozen Santa Clara County jail inmates spent nearly six uninterrupted minutes viciously beating a man they suspected had informed on his fellow gang members, and at no point did correctional officers try to stop it. The Nov. 30 attack, in which alleged participants yelled as they punched, kicked and dragged the man — one even poured floor cleaner on his open cuts — showed no signs that they were trying to conceal their actions, prosecutors said. They added that the beating grew to involve 31 people who literally knocked the victim from wall to wall, at times in line of sight of a guard station. It only ended when the attackers were finished, not because of any intervention, and by the time jail staff responded, the injured man was on the floor, naked and bloodied with head lacerations and broken ribs. “What was brutal and so shocking was the length that it went on for. It’s really shocking to see it go on for so long, with so many people,” Assistant District Attorney Stacey Capps said in an interview. “It was a very coordinated attack for that many people to be involved with one victim.” Neither Capps nor her office would comment on the response by correctional deputies. But sources familiar with the investigation told this news organization that the sheriff’s office was initially resistant to fully cooperating with prosecutors, due in part to the potential culpability that jail deputies had in allowing the attack to carry on for as long as it did. Those sources said certain pieces of evidence were not shared with prosecutors until a search warrant was presented. Tuesday, there was no indication that any criminal charges will be filed for any conduct by jail staff. A statement from the sheriff’s office issued Tuesday said the attack occurred in an in an “Indirect Supervision” dorm, where deputies are stationed outside a housing unit and are “responsible for multi-tasking and conducting other non-supervision duties” out of the view of inmates. The Santa Clara County Correctional Peace Officers Association declined to comment on the charges or the circumstances of the attack. County Public Defender Molly O’Neal, whose office represents the majority of people held at the jails, attributed the instance to a culture that dehumanizes incarcerated people. “It is the responsibility of correctional deputies to keep the carceral facilities safe, and to protect everyone in them,” O’Neal said Tuesday. “The idea that almost six full minutes elapsed while 31 people beat up another inmate and guards did not intervene is unfathomable. This has to stop.” “If you devalue everyone who is locked up … then you necessarily create an environment where it is OK to look away as one of them is beaten, in this case nearly to within an inch of his life,” O’Neal added. “Didn’t we learn anything about non-intervention from Derek Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd?” The 40-year-old victim was hounded just minutes after he was booked at the Elmwood men’s jail in Milpitas the evening of Nov. 30, according to a news release from the district attorney’s office. He was placed into a dorm with 36 other men being held together because of their affiliations with Sureño gangs in the area. Prosecutors said that several people in the dorm had learned while reviewing discovery materials for their pending criminal cases that the victim — whose name was withheld by prosecutors for his safety since he’s still in custody — had cooperated with police. The attack, which lasted 5 minutes and 37 seconds, was largely captured on surveillance video, prosecutors said. Several men hustled the victim to a corner and beat him, tearing away his clothes and dragging him across the dorm. The district attorney’s office said it had no plans to publicly release the video, citing an ongoing investigation. This news organization filed a public-records request for the footage Tuesday. All 31 men identified as being part of the attack were charged with felony assault and participating in a criminal street gang. But beyond that,19 were additionally charged with inflicting great bodily injury, two were charged with witness intimidation and two others were charged with retaliating against a witness. Capps said it took several months to bring charges partly because of the time needed for investigators and forensic analysts to view the footage frame-by-frame to identify each attacker and assess their level of involvement in the beating. The attack is another black eye for the Santa Clara County jail system regarding its protection of people being held in its facilities in San Jose and Milpitas, which have been assailed over the years by inmates-rights lawyers and criminal-justice reform advocates over jail conditions, concerns that were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2015, Michael Tyree, a mentally ill man being held in the Main Jail, was beaten to death at the hands of three jail deputies who were later convicted of murder. That spurred the formation of a jail-reform commission and also bolstered a major lawsuit against the county that was settled with a federal consent decree to improve conditions in the county jails. A civilian oversight body for the sheriff’s office created by county supervisors in 2018 is still getting established, slowed in part by lengthy negotiations over records access between the sheriff’s office and OIR Group, the firm contracted to evaluate and audit the sheriff’s patrol and jail operations.

319,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/05/11/teodoro-macias-colorado-springs-shooting-suspect/,"Trending: COLORADO SPRINGS — The man suspected of fatally shooting his girlfriend and five members of her extended family in a Colorado Springs mobile home had a history of jealous, controlling behavior and opened fire at the family’s birthday party in part because he was upset he wasn’t invited to the celebration, police said Tuesday. Investigators believe Teodoro Macias, 28, walked into a mobile home in the 2800 block of Preakness Way shortly after midnight Sunday and shot his girlfriend, 28-year-old Sandra Ibarra-Perez, and the five others in quick succession and in a deliberate manner, Colorado Springs police Lt. Joe Frabbiele said at a news conference Tuesday. The suspect then killed himself, according to police. “At the core of this horrendous act is domestic violence,” Chief Vince Niski said. “The suspect… displayed power and control issues. When he wasn’t invited to a family gathering, the suspect responded by opening fire.” Those killed were identified as Melvin Perez, 30, his wife Mayra Ibarra De Perez, 33; Melvin’s brother, Jose Gutierrez, 21; and the men’s mother, Joana Cruz, 52. Also killed were Mayra’s siblings, Ibarra-Perez and Jose Ibarra, 26. The suspect and Ibarra-Perez had been dating for about a year, Frabbiele said. While there were no official reports of domestic violence by Macias, Frabbiele said family members told investigators he was jealous, controlling and tried to isolate Ibarra-Perez from her family. Macias and Ibarra-Perez’s family had a conflict a week prior to the shooting at a different gathering, Frabbiele said. The suspect lived in Colorado Springs and had no criminal record, Frabbiele said. Macias arrived at the Canterbury Park mobile home community by himself and entered the trailer, where seven adults and three children had gathered to celebrate birthdays. The suspect methodically shot six of the adults in quick succession, Frabbiele said. The three children — ages 2, 5 and 11 — were in the main room of the home and witnessed the shooting, but later hid in one of the bedrooms. They were not physically harmed. One of the adults escaped the trailer unharmed. Three teenagers who had been at the party left shortly before the shooting to get an item from a neighbor. They returned to the trailer just after the shooting and before police arrived, Frabbiele said. Police received three 911 calls about the shooting, including one from inside the house from which dispatchers could hear rapid gunfire. When police arrived, only one injured person remained alive, but he died shortly thereafter. The killings left at least three children orphans, police said. Police found 17 bullet casings in the mobile home and a semi-automatic pistol near the suspect, as well as two 15-round magazines. A local gun store sold the gun in 2014 to someone other than Macias, Frabbiele said. Police continue to investigate how and when the suspect obtained the gun, which was not reported stolen. A relative of the suspect, identified as Chana Garcia on Facebook, declined to comment Monday. “Our family is not ready to release a statement at this time,” she wrote in a message. “Please allow us some time to grieve.” The Mother’s Day mass shooting is one of the deadliest in state history and happened just seven weeks after a gunman killed 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder. It is the deadliest shooting in Colorado Springs history, Mayor John Suthers said. “In Colorado, we’ve had domestic terrorism incidents where lots of people were killed,” Suthers said. “We’ve had random acts like going into King Soopers or a movie theater. But let’s not forget about the lethality of domestic violence.” Nine of 39 people killed in homicides in the city last year died in connection to domestic violence, according to Colorado Springs police statistics. About a third of aggravated assaults in the city in the first three months of 2021 were related to domestic violence. Outside the victims’ mobile home Tuesday, a handful of neighbors and strangers visited a small memorial outside the trailer, despite the rain and sleet. They added flowers and balloons to the table outside, already filled with candles, teddy bears and photos of the dead. Jerry Torres made the sign of the cross as he approached the table and said a small prayer. He called 911 the night of the shooting after he heard gunshots from his home a few trailers away. He heard screaming at first, he said, then silence. “That’s when I knew they were all gone,” he said.

Michael Conroy/AP The National Rifle Association is not bankrupt, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. The decision is a major blow to the nation’s oldest gun rights organization who, on January 15, filed for bankruptcy in order to relocate to Texas from New York, where it was chartered in 1871. Not only did the NRA’s effort to switch its registration out of New York to avoid litigation fail, the bankruptcy case backfired by airing plenty of previously unknown dirty laundry of the organization’s internal operations—and its leader, Wayne LaPierre. According to judge Harlin Hale, the NRA’s bankruptcy filing was a bad-faith attempt for the NRA to avoid facing the massive civil lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James last year that is seeking to dissolve the organization in its entirety. “The Court finds, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the NRA’s bankruptcy petition was not filed in good faith but instead was filed as an effort to gain an unfair litigation advantage in the NYAG Enforcement Action and as an effort to avoid a regulatory scheme,” Hale wrote in a 37-page decision. The decision comes after a weeks-long hearing that saw the testimony of a number of current and former NRA staff that shed light on the organization’s corruption. At the center of the controversy is LaPierre, the organization’s notorious executive vice president, who allegedly has been using the organization to funnel exorbitant funds to himself and his allies, according to the New York lawsuit. Throughout the hearings, lawyers for the New York attorney general brought forth a number of witnesses to testify to the sweetheart deals, exorbitant personal purchases that LaPierre and other NRA leaders used the organization’s funds for, and other illegal financial improprieties. Craig Spray, the NRA’s recently dismissed chief financial officer, testified that he had refused to sign the NRA’s most recent tax form after he raised concerns about its accuracy. But even with the NRA’s flow of cash to its top leaders, the issue of the organization’s financial status has been somewhat of a mystery—so much so that the group’s bankruptcy filing was a surprise even to its board and those still currently working for the organization. John Frazer, the NRA’s general counsel, testified during the hearing that even he had no idea that the leadership was planning to file for bankruptcy. The move caused a major internal rift, with a contingent of members of the NRA’s board pushing for an independent examiner to review the group’s finances. On the last day of the bankruptcy trial, the NRA had submitted a formal plan of reorganization. Though it had only been approved during a special board meeting a day before it was submitted to the judge, the plan called for the addition of a compliance officer at the top of the organization to keep its leadership in check, which would still include LaPierre. LaPierre himself testified during the trial, during which he acknowledged that he should have disclosed some of the more extravagant purchases that he paid for with the NRA’s money, including the funds he used to seek refuge on a friend’s luxury yacht after he was criticized for comments he made in the wake of a mass shooting. But LaPierre nonetheless shifted the blame of the NRA’s woes to its former leadership, including former President Oliver North and lobbyist Chris Cox, as well as James, the New York attorney general, whose lawsuit to dissolve the organization he claims is “politically motivated.” One of the most surprising twists of the hearing came during its closing arguments, when a Justice Department official with the U.S. trustee’s office called for the judge to dismiss the NRA’s bankruptcy claims—a rare move that proved to be a huge setback for the organization. Now that the NRA can’t file for bankruptcy, it’ll have to contend with the New York attorney general in court again, though it’s unclear when that will happen.

321,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/651965644/0/phoenix/nation~Three-Fort-Campbell-soldiers-charged-after-guns-in-pipeline-traced-to-Chicago-mass-shooting/,"NASHVILLE – Federal agents arrested three Fort Campbell soldiers Tuesday in connection to an illegal gun pipeline to Chicago after guns found at a mass shooting scene in Illinois were traced to Tennessee purchases, the Nashville U.S. Attorney's office announced. Demarcus Adams, 21; Jarius Brunson, 22; and Brandon Miller, 22, all enlisted members of the U.S. Army stationed in Clarksville, Tenn., face multiple federal charges in the case. Guns traced to the trio have been connected to multiple shootings including a late March attack that left one person dead and seven other people wounded on Chicago’s Far Southwest Side. 'Eye-popping numbers': Chicago sues Indiana gun store tied to 850 firearms recovered from crime scenes All three soldiers were arrested Tuesday morning by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, Mary Jane Stewart, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, said. Each solider is charged with transferring a firearm to an out-of-state resident; making false statements during the purchase of a firearm; engaging in the business without a firearms license; wire fraud; money laundering; and conspiracy to commit Title 18 offenses, according to a criminal complaint. Investigation of the firearms began March 26 when Chicago police went to the mass shooting in the city's Wrightwood neighborhood, court documents show. According to Chicago police, at least two men opened fire at a party shortly after midnight. Multiple firearms were recovered from the shooting scene and five of the firearms were found to have been recently purchased from Federal Firearms Licensed dealers in Clarksville, court documents show. Further investigation, the complaint continues, identified Adams, Brunson and Miller as the majority purchasers of these firearms. A broader investigation into firearms transaction records determined that since September 2019, the three men had purchased 91 firearms from multiple federal firearms dealers in Clarksville; Oak Grove, Kentucky; Hopkinsville, Kentucky; Fort Campbell, Kentucky; and Paducah, Kentucky. The majority of the firearms, the complaint continues, were purchased over the last five months. After the firearms were purchased, Miller would provide them to people he was associated with in Chicago, investigators claim in the criminal complaint. On Friday, prosecutors say, a federal search warrant was executed at the Clarksville home of Miller and Adams. There, 49 empty firearms cases were discovered — many of them matched to firearms recovered by the Chicago Police Department at the scene of recent shootings and homicides, the complaint noted. All three soldiers are slated to appear before a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Nashville Monday afternoon. The government has asked that at least one, Miller, be detained pending trial, court documents show. Prosecutors claim Miller led the effort to transport the guns and noted he is currently facing court martial proceedings through the military base related to an alleged sexual assault. Miller ""faces significant civilian and military justice charges and has very few, if any, connections to the Middle District of Tennessee, the defendant would pose a significant flight risk if he were released,"" they argued in the motion to detail filed Tuesday.

          / CBS News Police in Colorado Springs on Tuesday identified the six victims of a shooting that took place at a birthday party on Sunday. Police also identified the suspected shooter, who took his own life. Police identified the victims as Joana Cruz, 53; Jose Gutierrez, 21; Jose Ibarra, 26; Sandra Ibarra, 28; Mayra Ibarra de Perez, 33; and Melvin Perez, 30. Police said the victims were members of two families related through the marriage of Melvin Perez and Mayra Ibarra de Perez. ""At the core of this horrendous act is domestic violence,"" said Colorado Springs Police Department Chief Vince Niski. ""When he wasn't invited to a family gathering, the suspect responded by opening fire and killing six victims before taking his own life."" Police said the suspected gunman, 28-year-old Teodoro Macias, had been dating Sandra Ibarra for about a year at the time of the shooting. Police said Macias had attended another family gathering a week before the shooting, during which there was some type of conflict. ""The suspect had a history of controlling and jealous behavior towards the victim,"" the head of the violent crimes section said at a press conference. ""This behavior in particular was most obvious in trying to isolate her from her family, making efforts to prevent her from attending family events."" Police indicated, however, that there were no previously reported instances of domestic violence between the two. According to police, the party was being held at the home of Melvin Perez's mother, Joana Cruz, and stepfather. Several other children of Joana Cruz, including Jose Gutierrez, were also in attendance. There were 10 family members present when Macias arrived, three of whom were children aged 2, 5 and 11. Police said Macias shot all six victims ""in quick succession"" and then killed himself a short time later. One of the adults was able to escape the residence unharmed to call 911 to report the shooting. None of the children were harmed, however, police said they were close to the shooting and witnessed it ""to some degree."" Three other children, two 16-year-olds and one 18-year-old, had left the home shortly before the shooting to borrow something from a neighbor. They returned to the residence before police had arrived, unaware that the shooting had occurred. When police arrived, one of the victims, Jose Gutierrez, was still alive. He told police the suspect was still in the residence, and police began a sweep to clear the home. After the home was cleared, a second sweep was conducted by medical personnel, but all other victims were found dead, along with the suspected shooter. Gutierrez was taken to the hospital, where he later died. Police said some of the children at the party lost both parents in the shooting. According to police, the gun that was used was purchased in 2014 by someone other than the suspected shooter. They are attempting to locate the owner to determine how the suspect was able to obtain the gun, which was never reported stolen or resold.

326,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/army-times/news/your-army/~3/-0jmp8ClmyU/,"Three soldiers at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were arrested Tuesday by ATF and CID special agents after they allegedly purchased dozens of guns to be used on the streets of Chicago, including pistols found at a mass shooting that left one person dead and several others wounded earlier this year. Demarcus Adams, 21; Jarius Brunson, 22; and Brandon Miller, 22, were each charged with transferring a firearm to an out-of-state resident; making false statements during the purchase of a firearm; engaging in the business without a firearms license; wire fraud; money laundering; and conspiracy to commit Title 18 offenses, according to a federal criminal complaint. All three are specialists assigned to the 101st Airborne Division. Glock and Taurus pistols recovered from the scene of a fatal March 26 shooting in Chicago’s Southwest Side were traced back to purchases made by the three soldiers from licensed dealers in the area around Clarksville, Tennessee, according to the complaint signed by an ATF agent. Firearm transaction records showed that since September 2019, the trio purchased 91 guns from multiple dealers in the area around Fort Campbell, including towns in Kentucky and Tennessee, the complaint stated. The majority of the guns were purchased in the last five months. After the firearms were secured, Miller would provide them to his associates in Chicago, the complaint added. ATF agents and Chicago police interviewed Adams at a Fort Campbell CID office April 28. Authorities learned that Adams lived off-post with Miller at a Clarksville home. An Army CID agent has been charged with murdering his wife using poison. Adams was read his Miranda rights before he told police that Miller would give him money or electronic funds through Cash App to purchase the firearms. Miller would then take the guns to Chicago and sell them on the street, Adams told police, according to the complaint.

Adams consented to a search of his phone, which revealed a series of text messages between Adams, Miller and Brunson discussing the sales of guns, what phone apps to use for payments and where to go for purchases. “Fat boy u better take out a lil loan they want a lot of guns,” Miller told Adams in one exchange on March 1. ATF agents executed a federal search warrant at Miller and Adams’ Clarksville home April 28 — the same day of the initial interview. The agents recovered 49 empty gun cases there, at least four of which were matched to firearms recovered by Chicago police at the scene of recent shootings and homicides, according to the complaint. A rare gunfight between U.S. paratroopers and pro-Syrian regime forces last summer is at the center of charges preferred in April against an 82nd Airborne Division soldier. ATF agents obtained a search warrant for Miller’s phone and saw a text exchange in which he and Brunson shared pictures of handguns and discussed prices. “Glock 33 .357 for 550 plus tax,” Brunson told Miller in April. “I’m fina Apple Pay u,” Miller responded later, using a slang term that means “about to do.” Miller would also text with a person who used a Chicago area code phone number. The person’s name was not listed in the complaint. Miller and the unidentified person discussed a trip to Chicago, gas prices and the “risk” involved in driving with guns and ammunition. “We gotta hold this shit together ima still play the back role g I ain’t never turning my back on gang,” Miller told the unidentified person April 7. “We gone win this *war* we losing the battle but this a marathon not a race.” On April 15, Miller texted the Chicago phone number a picture showing a stack of handgun cases with the caption, “Ain’t even half.” The stack was similar to the one ATF agents recovered during the April 28 search, the complaint stated. The three soldiers are expected to appear before a U.S. judge in Nashville late Tuesday. If convicted, the men face up to 20 years in prison. “I can confirm that the Soldiers involved in the case are assigned to Fort Campbell,” said 101st Airborne Division spokesperson Lt. Col. Kari McEwen. “We will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities in this investigation.” None of the three soldiers have deployed overseas. Brunson is a unit supply specialist, Adams is a signal support systems specialist and Miller is a fire control specialist, McEwen said. Attorneys for the accused trio were not yet publicly listed as of Tuesday evening.

Investigators believe Teodoro Macias, 28, walked into a mobile home in the 2800 block of Preakness Way shortly after midnight Sunday and shot his girlfriend, 28-year-old Sandra Ibarra-Perez, and the five others in quick succession and in a deliberate manner, Colorado Springs police Lt. Joe Frabbiele said at a news conference Tuesday. The suspect then killed himself, according to police. “At the core of this horrendous act is domestic violence,” Chief Vince Niski said. “The suspect… displayed power and control issues. When he wasn’t invited to a family gathering, the suspect responded by opening fire.” Those killed were identified as Melvin Perez, 30, his wife Mayra Ibarra De Perez, 33; Melvin’s brother, Jose Gutierrez, 21; and the men’s mother, Joana Cruz, 52. Also killed were Mayra’s siblings, Ibarra-Perez and Jose Ibarra, 26. The suspect and Ibarra-Perez had been dating for about a year, Frabbiele said. While there were no official reports of domestic violence by Macias, Frabbiele said family members told investigators he was jealous, controlling and tried to isolate Ibarra-Perez from her family. Macias and Ibarra-Perez’s family had a conflict a week prior to the shooting at a different gathering, Frabbiele said. The suspect lived in Colorado Springs and had no criminal record, Frabbiele said. Macias arrived at the Canterbury Park mobile home community by himself and entered the trailer, where seven adults and three children had gathered to celebrate birthdays. The suspect methodically shot six of the adults in quick succession, Frabbiele said. The three children — ages 2, 5 and 11 — were in the main room of the home and witnessed the shooting, but later hid in one of the bedrooms. They were not physically harmed. One of the adults escaped the trailer unharmed. Three teenagers who had been at the party left shortly before the shooting to get an item from a neighbor. They returned to the trailer just after the shooting and before police arrived, Frabbiele said. Police received three 911 calls about the shooting, including one from inside the house from which dispatchers could hear rapid gunfire. When police arrived, only one injured person remained alive, but he died shortly thereafter. The killings left at least three children orphans, police said. Police found 17 bullet casings in the mobile home and a semi-automatic pistol near the suspect, as well as two 15-round magazines. A local gun store sold the gun in 2014 to someone other than Macias, Frabbiele said. Police continue to investigate how and when the suspect obtained the gun, which was not reported stolen. A relative of the suspect, identified as Chana Garcia on Facebook, declined to comment Monday. “Our family is not ready to release a statement at this time,” she wrote in a message. “Please allow us some time to grieve.” The Mother’s Day mass shooting is one of the deadliest in state history and happened just seven weeks after a gunman killed 10 people at a grocery store in Boulder. It is the deadliest shooting in Colorado Springs history, Mayor John Suthers said. “In Colorado, we’ve had domestic terrorism incidents where lots of people were killed,” Suthers said. “We’ve had random acts like going into King Soopers or a movie theater. But let’s not forget about the lethality of domestic violence.” Nine of 39 people killed in homicides in the city last year died in connection to domestic violence, according to Colorado Springs police statistics. About a third of aggravated assaults in the city in the first three months of 2021 were related to domestic violence. Outside the victims’ mobile home Tuesday, a handful of neighbors and strangers visited a small memorial outside the trailer, despite the rain and sleet. They added flowers and balloons to the table outside, already filled with candles, teddy bears and photos of the dead. Jerry Torres made the sign of the cross as he approached the table and said a small prayer. He called 911 the night of the shooting after he heard gunshots from his home a few trailers away. He heard screaming at first, he said, then silence. “That’s when I knew they were all gone,” he said.

Three soldiers stationed at Fort Campbell – which straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky border – were arrested by federal agents early Tuesday in connection to the transfer of dozens of firearms to Chicago associates after guns recovered from the scene of a mass shooting in the city were linked back to an illegal firearms pipeline. Demarcus Adams, 21, Jarius Brunson, 22, and Brandon Miller, 22, were arrested by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division, acting U.S. Attorney Mary Jane Stewart for the Middle District of Tennessee announced. The three men – all enlisted members of the U.S. Army stationed at the Fort Campbell military installation in Clarksville, Tennessee – were each charged with transferring a firearm to an out-of-state resident; making false statements during the purchase of a firearm; engaging in the business without a firearms license; wire fraud; money laundering; and conspiracy to commit Title 18 offenses. PROSECUTORS RECOMMEND 17-YEAR SENTENCE FRO EX-ARMY GREEN BERET TURNED RUSSIAN SPY The Chicago Police Department responded to a mass shooting on March 26 that left multiple people wounded and one person dead. Multiple firearms were recovered from the scene, including at least five found to be recently purchased from Federal Firearms Licensed (FFL) dealers in the Clarksville area, according to the criminal complaint. Adams, Brunson and Miller were later identified as the majority purchasers of those firearms, prosecutors said. A broader investigation into firearms transaction records from the FFLs in the Clarksville region determined that since September 2019, the trio had purchased 91 firearms from multiple FFLs in Clarksville, and also from Kentucky's Oak Grove, Hopkinsville, Fort Campbell and Paducah. The majority of the firearms were purchased during the last five months, according to the criminal complaint, which also alleges that after the firearms were purchased, Miller would provide them to individuals he was associated with in Chicago.

5.12.2021 3:20 PM Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis has announced her office is pursuing the death penalty against Robert Aaron Long, the 21-year-old man accused of shooting and killing eight people on March 16 at three Atlanta-area massage parlors. While making the announcement Tuesday, Willis acknowledged that on the campaign trail (she was elected in November) she told voters she ""could not imagine a circumstance where [she] would seek [the death penalty]."" But she now says she believes Long deserves the ""ultimate penalty"": Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis says she will seek death penalty for the Atlanta spa shootings suspect, despite campaigning on her opposition to it: ""Unfortunately, a case has arisen in the first few months of my term that I believe warrants the ultimate penalty"" pic.twitter.com/edvxmvcf4F — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 11, 2021  This reversal is tied to Willis' decision to pursue the case against Long as a hate crime. Georgia passed a law in 2020 that allow prosecutors to seek enhanced penalties against those who target victims based on their perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability. Six of the eight victims of Long's shootings were Asian women, and media speculation around the time of the incident focused on whether race played a role in Long's targeting. After his arrest, Long blamed a sex addiction, and said he had previously sought help at an evangelical treatment center. He had also been a customer at two of the massage parlors. Once we start talking about hate crime enhancements, then we actually have no choice but to analyze why Long killed these people. Long clearly developed a twisted focus on sexual purity, and the targeting of these women seems based more on his attitude toward himself, not his attitude toward their ethnicity. This is not a justification, it's simply a necessary thing to talk about when we talk about hate crimes. As for Willis, it's hard not to listen to her justification and think that the only unimaginable ""circumstance"" here is the entirely imaginable and understandable public outrage over a mass shooting. Does the ethnicity of his victims, or the extent of public outrage, make Long any more deserving of execution than any other murderer? Willis is a member of the Democratic Party, and the platform her party adopted when Biden was nominated for president calls for completely abolishing the death penalty. Of course, the national platform is not the same as a state party's platform (Georgia's does not mention the death penalty), and not every Democratic elected official is obligated to agree with the national or state party platform. That said, Willis made no exception for hate crimes when she declared her opposition to the death penalty in 2020. When President Donald Trump's administration fired up the federal death chamber again in 2020, the very first man executed, Daniel Davis Lee, was a white supremacist who brutally killed an Arkansas family to seize their weapons and money to fund the formation of a white ethno-state up in the Pacific northwest. The murders wouldn't be considered a hate crime even today, because the victims were white and their deaths were the result of a robbery gone wrong. But his actions were still motivated by racism, and criminal justice reformers nevertheless criticized Trump and his administration for reinstating the federal death penalty and executing 13 people in the final months of his presidency. What makes Willis' decision different or better than those made by Trump and former Attorney General Bill Barr? When Willis makes a death penalty exception for a hate crime, what she's signaling is that she actually is a supporter of this form of punishment, and furthermore, she believes it should be applied in response not to the needs of justice, but to cultural and political pressures that result from a high-profile incident. That is actually the opposite of justice. NEXT: Epidemiologists Still Urge Dubious Levels of Caution, Even for the Vaccinated Scott Shackford is an associate editor at Reason.

He is going to hear worse things where he’s headed What some people don’t understand is that ANYONE (regardless of race or gender) who has worked retail or food service long enough has had to deal with assholes.* I think this might be the first case I’ve heard of where that misunderstanding led to someone probably going to prison for life. **and you deal with them up until the point where the job is no longer worth it, then you quit. That is, if you’re a normal human and not a psychopath thanks http://review-oto.com/the-clickbank-kit-oto/ Georgia passed a law in 2020 that allow prosecutors to seek enhanced penalties against those who target victims based on their perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability, or physical disability. I guess incidental is close enough for this anti-death penalty huckster. >>But she now says she believes Long deserves the “ultimate penalty”: I mean how often does a state-sanctioned opportunity to kill whitey come along? And?  We’re surprised politicians are doing politician stuff now? Unless the speaker is Sister Prejean, I’m expecting people who are anti-death penalty to have some wiggle room, depending on the offender.  (I lacked the stones to ask her, in the Q/A portion of a 2002-era talk the local Innocence Project was putting on, whether her mind would be changed if it were Osama bin Laden in the dock.  I doubt it would be, and in any event, talk is cheap.) I’ll bet dollars to doughnuts that she would be opposed to the death penalty for Osama bin Laden. Oh, I agree, and she would further get to take refuge in the knowledge that such a decision would never be up to her. It just came to mind as a regret I had, tied to this subject.  You don’t get many opportunities to speak truth to power;  let them actually be forced to censor you.  Instead of your fear censoring you before you begin. Besides; the head of the IP who put on the talk was a Yalie arrogant asshole.  It would’ve been a great opportunity to embarrass him.  God knows the prick deserved it. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but I would not expect that.  I mean, if you are going to bother having an opinion on the death penalty, how can you not consider that sometimes really bad people might do really bad things? It’s like gun control  Why would some new shooting incident change your views on the subject?  You really never considered the possibility that something like that could happen? I’m sure my expectations are too high. I mean, if you are going to bother having an opinion on the death penalty, how can you not consider that sometimes really bad people might do really bad things? I would add that ‘making taxpayers lock people in cages, potentially solitary, for 60 yrs. isn’t more humane’ to the consideration. I make a similar argument all the time. The argument against the death penalty is not that people don’t deserve it. Many more people deserve the death penalty than receive it. Many deserve much worse. As Clint Eastwood said in Unforgiven, “Deserve?  Deserve’s got nothing to do with it “ The first rule of Tautology Club is the first rule of Tautology Club. Just saying. I’ve got no issue with people who are opposed to the death penalty. I’m mostly opposed myself. But this special exception carve out for people they don’t like is just bullshit. Mostly opposed is also partly supportive. Look, I’m opposed to the death penalty for parking violations.  We all have some limits.  Fani Willis was either lying about her limits or is just very, very stupid. (I know: embrace the power of “and”.) another day, another politician hypocrite Perhaps in the future society will elect leaders who refuse to make absolutist claims that they will inevitably feel forced to go back on but who, understanding that exceptions make the rules, take that as an incentive to constantly evaluate how their actions fit with their ethic- -AHAHAHAHA I can’t do it anymore. I’d say that if you’re elected to office after promising not to do X, and then you change your mind and decide that X is in the public interest, you should simply resign and leave the job to someone who isn’t bound by an inconvenient campaign promise. In this case, the prosecutor should resign and let some other prosecutor seek the death penalty. I doubt very much her presence in the case is essential. And she can always run again the next time there’s an election, specify that this time she’s not making any promises, and then feel at liberty to seek the death penalty. Ha ha, I love spinning these imaginary scenarios. Maybe some organization can give awards to politicians who resign rather than violate ill-advised campaign promises. (I don’t know if a cash award would be legal, but maybe an award certificate in a nice frame?) Resign rather than violate *or keep* ill-advised promises. Again – not to give them money for their official decisions – God forbid! – but to give the other thing politicians crave – praise and pats on the back. Having trouble seeing the libertarian or other case for giving someone an award for having resigned as being inherently illegal. Paying someone to recuse themselves from a case? Absolutely illegal. Giving someone a job in the private sector to leave their regulatory position? Shady and maybe kinda illegal. Handing someone the potential to win a pile of cash for already having left the position? Seems like legitimate free speech to me, though I’m no anti-Campaign Finance Law expert. In Libertopia, then paying people to resign wouldn’t be necessary because public officials would only serve out of duty and would go back to private life as soon as they possibly could. Under the current (nonlibertarian) set-up, I’m not sure I’d endorse paying people money in connection with their activities as govt officials – even to persuade them to keep their word to the voters. But, as I tried and seemingly failed to highlight, this isn’t or wouldn’t be paying people in connections with their government activities, quite the opposite. Maybe I’m misconceptualizing it, but the politician would have to retire from office under no promise of winning the award just to qualify. Admittedly, haggling after payments have been disbursed has been considered quid pro quo in recent history, but I don’t see how, in broad sense of corruption, it’s any worse than honoring a former President with a Nobel Peace Prize 20 yrs. after his Presidency. Maybe if you’re giving out awards to people retiring from Congress to serve in another higher office but, presumably, your awarding committee would avoid such impropriety. But, considering we hand out Nobel Peace Prizes to Presidents in their first year, there’s a distinct possiblity it would be glad-handing farce. Exhibit A as to why pro-death penalty is a bipartisan issue.  You can print all the “but support is shrinking” articles you want (I’ve been reading them since the late 80s), but at some point, somewhere, almost everyone agrees that there is some limit down in the bowels of awful crime at which a death penalty can kick in. Then, I think, those people are not opposed to the death penalty. They’re opposed to the death penalty in *this* case or in *that* case – they don’t think the crime at hand is worth killing over. I, on the other hand, oppose the death penalty not because I think some crimes don’t deserve killing over (and I do think that some don’t), or because I think we wouldn’t be better off without this or that criminal, but because I simply don’t trust the state. I don’t trust the state to get the right guy all the time.  So I’m willing to support a 100% moratorium on the death penalty simply because, yes, even with OBL (or Manson, or Dalhmer, or . . . pick your heinous criminal of choice)` in the dock, I would rather a guilty person spend their lives in jail than a single innocent be executed. If I was innocent and convicted, I would rather be executed than spend 50 years in prison. Really?  I would rather preserve the possibility that justice might be done some day.  Hope is a powerful thing.  I think most people in that situation would still want to live. Too hard to distinguish one way or the other a priori. If revenge is some kind of moral no-no, I’d say false hope is as bad or worse. Dying is always an option.  I imagine it is particularly accessible in a prison yard. Then suicide. It says something nastier than merely reneging on a previously stated opposition to the death penalty.  It says that she values the lives of certain types of victims more and certain kinds of perpetrators less, apparently depending on their demographic classifications.  In other words, she is a bigot. And, in this particular case where the evidence strongly suggests that the hate crime is incidental or circumstantial, the best kind of bigot, a murderous one. She’s trying to execute the anti-Asian bigot who was frequenting Asians in massage parlors to bolster his alibi before he committed his crime. Arguably a lying, murderous bigot. Nothing say ‘I only support the death penalty in extremely limited circumstances’ like jumping on the first opportunity you get to execute a mentally ill person. Nice job! Trash media still pushing this anti asian BS. News flash for ya Scott; democratic politicians lie. Given that she replaced Paul Howard, who engaged in some dubious prosecutions to distract attention from the fact that he was a corrupt piece of shit, I have to wonder what she’s engaging in dubious prosecutions to distract attention from. There’s no way in hell this “hate crime” enhancement stands up to scrutiny and she’s dumber than a sack of hammers if she thinks it will. This is a pure political stunt, but for what purpose is she pulling it? To get people to think hate crime is a real thing. Yeah, not sure what else she’s doing. Not sure it could be worse than that. Its amazing how many politicians are aghast at the idea of the state killing people (whether by lethal injection or drone strike) until they’re the ones handed the power to sign  the death warrant. Yet one more reason to abolish the death penalty. And then there’s you. So one less?  Balance is maintained. Yet one more reason to abolish *some of* the death penalty. You conveniently forgot extrajudicial assassination via drone strike. Short answer-most anti-Asian crimes are committed by black people and she doesn’t want to contribute to the stereotype I think for a lot of people the death penalty is complicated.  While a certain segment enthusiastically supports and others categorically oppose it, others are on a spectrum.  Generally I’m not in favor of it for a mixture of ethical and pragmatic reasons.  It’s incredibly expensive and it’s application is racially and socially biased; you’re far better off being rich and guilty than poor and innocent.  I’m also not aware of any good philosophical framework that can legitimately justify the use of deadly force by The State as retribution outside of legitimate self defense. The only argument I can make for it is simply emotional.  It feels like no lesser punishment suffices for certain crimes that shock the conscience. When someone like McVeigh kills 168 people in cold blood including women and children, the human mind seeks retribution and it seems a shame that he can only die once.  Likewise, when those entrusted with protecting The People betray that oath and prey upon them like Chauvin did, death seems too mild for their crimes. That said I’m not a supporter of inventing new categories of ‘hate crimes.’  Clearly any murder is a hateful act and I see no cause to prioritize punishing one kind of hatred over another. The death penalty is wrong. Jailing unrepentant multiple murderers for life at taxpayer expense is wrong. So what should the standard BE for when the death penalty applies?  Most people don’t think every murder (or every intentional murder) should get the death penalty.   And the Supreme Court would not allow that. So what makes something capital murder, as opposed to go-to- prison-for -life murder? Until we can come up with some kind of neutral standard that applies in every murder case, then all death penalties will be some form of revenge. I dunno, back when SCOTUS restored the death penalty in the 1970s, they rejected one state’s law (Maryland, I think), that would have made it mandatory for all murders. But now perhaps the current court would allow it? “There is a system in place for applying the death penalty. I’m going to pretend to take the moral high road by pretending it doesn’t exist. I’m going to pretend to take the moral high road so that I can pretend that the death penalty is inextricably linked to revenge.” – Bored Lawyer So what should the standard BE for when jaywalking/shoplifting/B&E/assault/theft/rape charges apply? Most people don’t think every jaywalking/shoplifting/B&E/assault/theft/rape (or every intentional jaywalker/shoplifter/burglar/assailant/thief/rapist) should face criminal charges. And the Supreme Court would not allow that. So what makes something jaywalking/shoplifting/B&E/assault/theft/rape, as opposed to simply walking across the street? Until we can come up with some kind of neutral standard that applies in every jaywalking/shoplifting/B&E/assault/theft/rape case, then all penalties for jaywalking will be some form of revenge. I don’t think you even know what a ‘lawyer’ is. Most people don’t think every murder (or every intentional murder) should get the death penalty. I don’t know about “most people”, but I think that death should be the presumptive punishment for intentional, and premeditated murder. The defense (again, just my opinion) should be allowed to make a case for special circumstances, maybe because the the defendant was under some exceptional stress, or he believed the victim posed some unreasonable, but non-imminent, risk to his own life. non-imminent, risk to his own life Imminent threats to one’s own life shouldn’t take the death penalty off the table? 🙂 Hate motivated murders? Like one estranged spouse killing another? Like someone killing a cheating partners paramour? Like neighbor having a dispute? Like co-workers that can’t get along? Like a fired employee taking revenge? Most murders are hate motivated, yet not on of these will ever be charged as a hate crime. You see, murder is murder and comes with sever penalties. Yet the government picks and chooses certain crimes to pile on. It is totally political and has nothing to do with hate. Moreover, the progression or juxtaposition is crystal clear in this case. Reducing or eliminating the death penalty doesn’t make the law any more just or any less revenge motivated. This has been shown multiple times across multiple circuits and countries. The ideal may be letting one guilty man go free so that 100 innocent men never face conviction, but the reality is we’re letting one guilty man spend the rest of his life in solitary so that out of 100 innocent men, 10 can have their assets seized, 10 can be fined for goods that were stolen from them, 5 can serve 30 yrs. for being falsely accused, and 2 can be asphyxiated or shot to death in their home for no particular reason at all. Like “racism” and “phobia”, “hate” has a new meaning in the new world. It now means “politically unpopular”. Hate motivated murders? Like one estranged spouse killing another? Like someone killing a cheating partners paramour? Like neighbors having a dispute? Like co-workers that can’t get along? Like a fired employee taking revenge on a supervisor? Most murders are hate motivated, yet not on of the above will ever be charged as a hate crime. You see, murder is murder and comes with sever penalties. Yet the government picks and chooses certain crimes to pile on. It is totally political and has nothing to do with hate. Hate motivated murders? Like one estranged spouse killing another?

Yet the government picks and chooses certain crimes to pile on. It is totally political and has nothing to do with hate, except maybe the States hate for it’s citizens. It make no one safer in any way. Well said. You’re probably right that most murders are motivated by hate. Isn’t it ironic that hate sometimes results in a less-severe penalty? A “cold-blooded” killing, where there is clearly premeditation and planning, plus a dispassionate attempt to cover up the crime, is usually seen as much worse than when someone’s hate and anger makes them lose control. You’re probably right that most murders are motivated by hate. Could be, but I don’t think it’s completely obvious.  I think a lot are motivated by fear, indifference or self-interest.  And some are psychopaths who just don’t give a fuck. Those are just examples. My question is murder comes with sever penalties. Should the government pick and chose that some murders should get stiffer penalties based on the preconception of the state? Yes facts matter, but does is the state the one that decides intent? If you kill someone the same as you in every other manner than killing someone different than you, does that mean you should be punished harsher? Those are just examples.

Yes facts and circumstances matter, but should the state be the one that decides intent? If you kill someone like you in  the exact same manner and circumstances as you kill someone different than you, does that mean you should be punished harsher? She’s a politician. Enough said. Don’t know much about GA politics, but were she not to seek the death penalty in this case, the GOP would surely use her as a poster child for the donkey party being murderer cuddling pussies. Here in Virginia, most dems supported the death penalty too, until they figured out it was politically safe for them to be against it. The prosecutor was right in first place and should have stuck with that line.  This is hypocrisy and I hope it is called out by all death penalty critics. Agreed, but she is a politician who no doubt plans to run for statewide office, and most Georgians probably will hold it against her if she indeed practiced what she preached in this case. It made sense at first for her to say one thing while she was looking for money from rich liberal donors, but that was then. Thus, we reach the natural conclusion of the “hate crime” absurdity. No longer do our leaders wish to determine punishment based on who the perpetrators hate.  Now it’s our leaders hatred of certain perpetrators that influences punishment. If only we had been warned – a million times. Thus, we reach the natural conclusion of the “hate crime” absurdity. I think it also belies the anti-death penalty absurdity and, to a degree, the anti-police and anti-2A absurdity. People who despise the death penalty because it’s unjust and revenge-motivated would be a-OK with revenge-motivated life imprisonment or worse. Obviously, the optimal outcome would be that Long got help for his perceived issue without killing anyone. There’s not much we can do about that without creating a state-backed religion and otherwise grossly infringing on peoples’ rights. First runner-up from a liberty perspective is that long draws a gun to shoot someone and a civilian shoots him first. Second runner-up is Long shoots someone and police shoot him. The situation where we end up with 8 dead people and a years-long, multi-million dollar debate where corrupt politicians get to weigh in on whether the taxpayers should execute him or pay to keep him in a cage can’t possibly be in the top 5. To the death penalty opponents; let’s say the DA stuck with her principles and said that she just wants him to be locked in a prison cell for the rest of his natural life and proceeded to use hate crime convictions to do so. Would you still oppose her actions? Would that not be the same revenge-seeking behavior that causes the death penalty to be unjust? In the 1 guilty man vs. 100 innocent men conceptualization, aren’t you effectively winnowing it down so that it’s 1 guilty man vs. 10 innocent men and, intentionally or not, winnowing it down specifically in favor of the guilty man? Hate crimes are thought crimes.  How can anyone approve of thought crimes? Murdering me for my wallet is no less a crime than murdering me for my skin color. If you put the criminal in a cell and weld the door shut, not to be opened until the criminal is observed to be dead in the cell, no matter how many years it takes, fine. Hate crimes are thought crimes. How can anyone approve of thought crimes? That’s not the juxtaposition here. Let’s pretend you discovered a magic lamp and the genie says he can make hate crimes go away or he can make the death penalty go away but not both. Exercising a similar sort of future-past omniscience that you exercised in your hypothetical; let’s say we know that commanding the genie to end the death penalty will double or even triple the number of hate crimes on the books but ending hate crimes will multiply the number of executions, which do/would you choose? From my perspective in your hypothetical, you’re dead. I don’t much care what you want, it’s all revenge for a dead man. The only difference is welding him in an airtight cage solves whatever problem he posed in a few minutes rather than a few decades, which saves lots of people time and money. Being dead, do you particularly care whether we make the cage airtight or spend the extra money to keep him alive? Why should I care? From your POV, it’s revenge either way. Well, for me, opposition to the death penalty isn’t because it’s revenge, or anything like that (that’s another issue, any sentence beyond what is necessary to control a dangerous person is going to have some revenge element to it).  For me it’s because I don’t trust the state to do it accurately and consistently and I find the possibility of the state executing an innocent person unacceptable.  There are certainly problems with locking people up forever too, as you say, but at least people can be let out. I do agree that the best thing would really be if someone just shot him while he was actively murdering (preferably before anyone actually gets murdered). So, let’s say the local sheriff saddled up a posse and went and hanged Long. Would you oppose it on principle or only if they got the wrong guy? I support the death penalty in principle, but I don’t trust government to only kill those who have it coming.   Ideally, the death penalty is administered by the victim on the spot when the perp does something that requires the victim to defend himself with lethal force. -jcr BTW, part of the standard objection to the death penalty is the contention that the condemned is tortured by botched execution methods.  There is a way to kill someone without any pain at all, and that’s by hypoxia in a 100% nitrogen environment.  No cyanide, no accumulation of CO2 to make them feel like they’re suffocating, they simply pass out and die a few minutes later. -jcr It’s really weird how lethal injection became the standard.  Just seems needlessly complicated and easy to screw up. There is *many* a way to kill someone without any pain at all Nitrogen asphyxiation is but one method. Also, since we’re splitting hairs, the objection isn’t just pain but pain, panic, and discomfort. Saturated nitrogen hoods generally prevent panic and discomfort but aren’t 100% reliable. Slow nitrogen saturation provides plenty of time for panic and discomfort. Personally, I’d rather be subjected to slow room-level saturation as the hood or box would be extremely discomforting and I say that as someone who has routinely worn sealed headgear professionally and occasionally breathes from compressed air cylinders recreationally. Justice is repayment, to the victim (or victim’s NOK), by the perpetrator. That’s it. It’s really simple. It’s an eye for an eye, a life for a life, a dollar for a dollar (plus, perhaps, a bit more due to opportunity costs). It’s an accounting equation. Any other attempt to define “justice” is always fatally (ha) doomed from the start. For murderers, the victim’s NOK should have the right, after guilt is determined by a reliable authority (such as a jury), to kill the person, or to forgive all or some of the debt that the murderer has incurred. Once the equation is balanced, either fully or if it’s “written off”, justice is done and that’s the end of it. I’m fully for the death penalty for murderers, whether the act is premeditated or not, but the State is quite obviously too incompetent (or too evil) to do this task. I’m fully for the death penalty for murderers, whether the act is premeditated or not, but the State is quite obviously too incompetent (or too evil) to do this task. See my question to Zeb above. If the Fulton Co. sheriff rounded up a posse and hanged Long, would you be opposed to that as policy or only in cases where they hanged the wrong guy? The ‘State is too incompetent’ argument, while not unfounded, is a dodge for some/many. Assuming someone like Long (or Dahlmer or Manson or take your pick) needs to die, who is going to “get it right” policy-wise? I’m not saying it’s The State. I’m saying that many of the people who say ‘The State shouldn’t be doing it’ don’t recognize or clarify that having the police or vigilantes executing people or letting murderers roam free or simply imprisoning more people longer isn’t exactly a better policy. What the hell is so wrong with the death penalty? I 100% support it as the punishment for any and all convicted murders. Regardless of the motivation, hate crime or not. I personally support it for all convictions of violent or property crimes. Implementing that will lower crime rates dramatically both as a deterrent and permanently removing a violent/property criminal from society upon their first conviction. The absolutely biggest problem in American society nowadays is lack of consequences. You can see it in lax sentencing, welfare, bailouts, eviction/foreclosure moratoriums, etc… It’s all tied together, not being held to the full consequence of your own life choices. And before anyone asks, yes, I’m a libertarian. I just think being anti death penalty is being anti consequences. If somebody has proven they can’t be trusted to not violate the natural rights of others, there should be 0 expectation that their natural rights (including the right to life) should be respected. The existence of any doubt precludes proof. Someone should have had their hands cut off when they were a child for stealing. I don’t understand the objection to capital punishment. In cases like this one where it is certain that the accused killed someone, not in self defence, it’s only fair. Why should I pay to keep a murderer alive even for a little while? Why should a murderer ever walk free again? You really want the government to have the power to legally kill it’s citizens? Death penalty is expensive to society, too. The legal costs are very large. But hey, as long as we, who by the way didn’t see what happen, are “certain.” The emphasis in discussing hate crimes seems to be on the hate rather than the crime. Murder is a crime because someone loses their life. There is no need to determine whether or not the murderer had hate for the victim. All human life is valuable and that is why murder is a crime. It should be dealt with on that basis and no other. Labelling some murders as ‘hate crimes’ is some skewered way of trying to say that some people who are members of minority groups victims lose more than those who are not. What more can you lose than your life? Murder is a crime and that is all we need to know. Trying to elevate the loss of a minority group person above that of others is patronising to those groups. If those groups are unjustly treated or discriminated against then arguments should be brought forward to deal with that reality and appropriate action taken. It is not appropriate to try and emotionally manipulate society by using illogical arguments about certain murders being worse than others. Don’t underestimate the value of a victim gold card. Only because he is white. Had he been one of her people it would not have been sought. So she is against death penalty and then some murders happen and, omg!, I could have never conceived of a crime so bad, NVM, fry dat sum bitch! Please log in to post comments Billy Binion

335,https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2021/05/12/washington-post-cnn-is-opinionated-and-emotional-thanks-to-jeff-zucker-n389561,"Today the Washington Post has a piece up about the emo turn at CNN. It’s titled “The new CNN is more opinionated and emotional. Can it still be ‘the most trusted name in news’?” But that headline sounds a lot more interesting than the story actually is. What we actually get is a kind of look back over the Zucker era of CNN with a mostly positive spin on his leadership and his willingness to let CNN hosts be more opinionated and…weepy. “One of the things that I’ve tried to encourage is authenticity and being real,” Zucker said. “If we pretend not to be human, it’s not real.” These days, it’s not uncommon for CNN personalities to cry on air. In March, anchor Brianna Keilar got tearful during a segment about a mass shooting at a grocery store in Colorado. And after correspondent Sara Sidner apologized for getting choked up during a January report about pandemic deaths (“It’s really hard to take,” she sighed), the boss called to reassure her. The article does admit this relaxed approach sometimes leads to problems. Chris Cuomo — who has exemplified the New CNN as much as any on-air personality — won over many viewers early last year when he both chronicled his own battle with covid-19 and hailed the public-health efforts of his brother, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, in regular segments where the two would banter cutely about their childhood. That decision put CNN in an uncomfortable position when the New York Democrat became mired in scandal — allegations that he sexually harassed women and that his administration concealed the number of covid deaths in the state’s nursing homes — and the network decided that one of its primetime stars is now too conflicted to discuss one of the biggest political stories in the country… So when Cuomo explained a year later that he couldn’t interview his brother about the allegations lobbed against him, some network critics saw a double standard at play. “Why is this different from spring/summer of last year?” Mary Katharine Ham, a right-leaning CNN contributor, asked on Twitter. But the general tone of the commentary is that the new CNN is just better TV than the old, straight-laced version. But eventually the piece gets around to the real core of the Zucker era of CNN, it’s resistance to President Trump. CNN’s chief White House correspondent, Jim Acosta, pushed back on Trump’s press secretaries and critiqued the administration in a way that raised the eyebrows of news traditionalists. “This is a nation without a president,” Acosta said last year, criticizing Trump’s response to the coronavirus crisis. CNN had its best year ever last year thanks to the pandemic and President Trump. So, not surprisingly, 2021 is shaping up rather differently. Without Trump to serve as a foil and with the constant emergency of the pandemic waning thanks to the vaccines, CNN has been struggling in the ratings. As Ed noted yesterday, CNN appears to be falling behind its competitors in the ratings even as ratings for all the networks have drifted back to earth. CNN and MSNBC reaped the rewards of becoming the resistance networks for two different wings of the Democratic Party. Jeff Zucker was definitely behind that shift at CNN. But now that Democrats have the White House, the House and the Senate it’s hard for CNN to hold the interest of the viewers it gathered over the past four years looking for daily Republican outrage material. When you add in the fact that Trump has been removed from most social media sites, there’s not much left for CNN to capitalize on. The past four months have been a series of GOP media villains, each an attempt to replace Trump as a target. I don’t know how much longer CNN can continue to milk this sort of thing. By this point, Zucker and the other suits must be hoping Republicans re-take the House so they’ll have someone new to complain about. Zucker himself may be leaving the network at the end of the year. He probably should have left in January if he wanted to avoid going out in the midst of a ratings drop. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

336,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/05/12/boulder-king-soopers-reopening-date/,"Trending: The King Soopers grocery store in Boulder where a gunman killed 10 people in March will be extensively renovated and is expected to reopen in late fall, store representatives announced Wednesday. The store at 3600 Table Mesa Drive has been closed and the parking lot fenced off since the March 22 mass shooting, in which a 21-year-old Arvada man is accused of walking in and fatally shooting employees, customers and a responding police officer. Store representatives and city officials said renovating and reopening the store will be a key step forward for the community as residents and employees continue to deal with the aftermath of the attack. “We know that the building is just part of what makes this store so special, and that restoring it is just another step in the journey as we continue to rebuild and heal,” Jessica Trowbridge, a King Soopers spokeswoman, said during a news conference Wednesday. The company considered demolishing the store, but decided instead to “completely renovate both the interior and exterior of the building,” Trowbridge said. The redesign may include additional security measures, she said, but did not elaborate. The company is working with employees who survived the shooting to ensure they are comfortable returning to work at the site, she added. She declined to say whether employees who were not willing to return to work there would be allowed to transfer to other stores. The employees in the store during the attack will receive emergency pay through June 19, Trowbridge said. As the construction process gets underway, the city will clear away the streetside memorial that sprung up in the days after the shooting, said Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver. The flowers, signs, flags and cards left at the chain link fence will be removed after Memorial Day and preserved by the Museum of Boulder, which will work with the victims of the attack to determine where the items should be kept and displayed. The city is also considering installing a permanent “Boulder Strong” memorial to mark the massacre, deputy city manager Chris Meschuk said. That process is expected to take several years, he said, and he had no details on the potential cost, design or location of such a memorial. Boulder police Chief Maris Herold said she’d like to see a separate memorial for slain Officer Eric Talley as well. The announcement of the store’s reopening continues the city’s effort to move on from the mass shooting even as the long court process for the suspect is only just getting underway. The gunman, who exchanged fire with a Boulder police officer and was shot in the leg, put down his weapons and was arrested about one hour after the attack began. He now faces 54 criminal charges and is scheduled to appear in court again May 25. Last week, King Soopers representatives announced they were donating much of the store’s inventory — about 14 semitrailers full of goods — to a local food bank. And in April, people who were present during the attack and wanted to revisit the store as part of the healing process were allowed to do so. A motive for the shooting spree is not clear. At his first court appearance, the suspect’s public defender said her team needed time to evaluate “the nature and depth of (his) mental illness.” Those killed in the attack were: Denny Stong, 20; Neven Stanisic, 23; Rikki Olds, 25; Tralona Bartkowiak, 49; Teri Leiker, 51; Talley, 51; Suzanne Fountain, 59; Kevin Mahoney, 61; Lynn Murray, 62; and Jody Waters, 65.

Wednesday, 12 May 2021 04:35 PM Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie will receive $740,000 in severance pay after being indicted on a perjury charge by a grand jury investigating the 2018 school massacre in Parkland.  Runcie's tenure will end Aug. 10 under an agreement approved Tuesday by the school board Tuesday in a 5-4 vote. He has served as superintendent since 2011. Opponents to Runcie's severance package who cite it as too generous include Lori Alhadeff and Debra Hixon. Both had family members killed in the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people.  The deal came a month after Runcie was indicted on a perjury charge. He is accused of lying to a federal grand jury. Runcie has pleaded not guilty.  Runcie supporters said allowing him to leave ""allows us to move on as a district and focus on students,"" according to Fox News.  The superintendent will receive $145,000 in severance pay, $112,000 in salary, $230,000 for unused vacation and sick days, $187,000 in payments to his pension plan, and $25,000 to repay his lawyer for negotiating his departure.  In addition, the board has agreed to pay for Runcie's criminal defense, which could cost between $100,000 and $350,000. That cost is not included in the severance package. Runcie has agreed to pay that total back if he is found guilty or pleads guilty or no contest. He would face up to five years in prison if convicted.  Prosecutors say Runcie lied before the grand jury six weeks ago about a criminal case against his former technology chief, Tony Hunter. The grand jury indicted Hunter on charges that he rigged a contract in exchange for a bribe. Hunter has pleaded not guilty.  Prosecutors say Runcie lied when he said he had not contacted anyone about the Hunter case.  Runcie was a public face for the Broward school district in the aftermath of the shooting in Parkland. His supporters have praised him for raising the graduation rate, improving the schools districtwide, and reaching out to minority communities.  In 2019, Runcie survived a board 6-3 vote to have him fired. The attempt was led by Alhadeff, whose daughter was killed in the shooting.  Related Stories:   © 2021 Newsmax. All rights reserved.

The King Soopers renovation should be completed by late fall, Jessica Trowbridge, corporate affairs manager for the company said. The large grocery store is an essential neighborhood asset and reopening it ""sends a clear message that we will not be bowed by our recent tragedy, and that hope and solidarity can overcome fear and hatred,"" Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver said. On March 22, a gunman opened fire outside and inside the store, killing 10 people, including a Boulder police officer. The suspected shooter was wounded and has been criminally charged. Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in late April that investigators don't have a grasp as to a motive. Flowers, signs and other mementos on a fence outside the store will be removed and transferred to the Museum of Boulder for documentation and preservation. Weaver said the museum will work with victims' families to determine the best way for preservation. The city is also in very early discussions for a possible permanent memorial, Deputy City Manager Chris Meshuk said. That could take years, and it hasn't been determined what one could look like or where it would be. Trowbridge said the company wants feedback from the community and employees about the redesign. Scenes of other mass shootings have reopened after renovations. Walmart renovated and reopened an El Paso store after a gunman killed 23 people in an Aug. 3, 2019, attack. In Colorado, the Aurora movie theater where a gunman killed 12 people in 2012 was renovated, renamed and reopened a year after the attack.

342,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/13/man-who-drove-through-protest-crowd-pleads-to-gun-charges/,"Trending: PASADENA  — A California man who drove a pickup truck through a Southern California crowd peacefully protesting the death of George Floyd last year pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal firearms crimes. Benjamin Jong Ren Hung, 28, of San Marino entered pleas to 11 felonies, including conspiracy, transporting and receiving firearms across state lines, making false statements during purchases of firearms, and possession of unregistered firearms. He could face nearly three years in federal prison when he is sentenced in August. The case centered on an illegally obtained handgun that Hung brought with him to a May 31, 2020, counter-protest in neighboring Pasadena. Hung accelerated a flag-draped pickup truck with vanity license plates reading “WAR R1G” toward the intersection where protesters were gathered, authorities alleged. He sounded a train horn installed on the truck, stopped and then continued through the intersection, causing the truck to produce excessive exhaust in a technique called “coal rolling,” authorities said. No one was hurt, and Hung wasn’t charged with assault. However, Pasadena police detained Hung, and the FBI took over the investigation. In a plea agreement, Hung acknowledged participating in a multiyear conspiracy to make false statements to firearms dealers in Oregon and to illegally take the firearms to California, evading registration laws. He gave cash to a co-conspirator in Oregon to buy handguns for him and to falsely state that the co-conspirator was the buyer. The co-conspirator then delivered the guns to Hung in California.

Prosecutors said Hung also admitted falsely attesting to firearms dealers in Washington that he was a resident of that state in order to buy four rifles and a shotgun in March 2020, and also to illegally taking the guns to California. Hung acknowledged possessing three unregistered short-barreled semiautomatic rifles that were seized from his family’s home in Lodi in September 2020. Prosecutors said Hung used his family’s vineyard in Lodi as a training camp and gun range “to prepare for civil disorders,” according to the criminal complaint.

343,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/Jdf032c3eD0/,"Longstanding journalistic maxims would have a reporter remain disengaged while gathering the facts. But pursuing the whole truth means considering the humanity of one’s subjects—and of oneself. Lived experience can help a reporter empathize and deepen their work in the service of telling stories that accurately reflect the world. After an intense year of reporting on stories about the struggles endured by people who share their identities, TIME journalists reflect on the lessons they will carry forward in their work.  On May 26, 2020, I signed on to Slack as usual: Nadia on syndication. My role as an editorial producer at the time consisted primarily of building posts with articles from partners like the Associated Press. That day was no different. I was working from my hometown outside of Grand Rapids, Mich., where I’d relocated to be closer to my family during the pandemic. But what had begun as an escape back to familiarity quickly became one of the most untenable months of my career. That morning, after learning there was bystander footage of an officer kneeling on a Black man’s neck in Minneapolis, I felt sick. I understand the news cycle; stories about Black trauma break then quickly fade. Filled with dread, I went to pull one of the AP’s initial reports, as I was asked. It was then that I read that the man in the video, George Floyd, had repeatedly told the officers, “I can’t breathe.” It wasn’t the first time we’ve heard that phrase. I have no desire to watch videos of Black death—the ending never changes. But while I avoided watching the full video of Floyd’s murder, I saw enough clips in the context of my work to absorb the horror. And in the 24 hours that followed, I fixated on gruesome images and videos—protesters of various identities who had come together to declare enough is enough being struck, tear gassed and shot with rubber bullets. Witnessing police brutality and modern-day lynchings on my screen just reminded me how expendable Black folks are perceived to be. As a junior staffer, I didn’t have the privilege of escaping—updating that post was my job. “Checking in” would later become an expected newsroom practice, but at the time, the well-being of my Black colleagues and me seemed like an afterthought. I wasn’t offered time off or even a moment to step away and have a coworker take the reins. Instead, I felt like I needed to desensitize myself to my own oppression. There were no Black editors around to tell me otherwise. Already isolated because of the pandemic, I grew numb, then resentful because policy barred expressing views on anything seen as political. (Our guidelines now allow protesting for human rights.) Still, I felt I had to do something—I knew that if Black people weren’t involved in the telling of our stories, they could be botched. Despite my place in the hierarchy, I did harness a small yet crucial power in syndicating articles, often the first pieces TIME will publish on breaking news: I had a say in the headlines. As the largely peaceful demonstrations went on in the days and weeks after Floyd’s death, I saw two words again and again in the default text: violent and riot. These dog whistles underscored the media’s interpretation of the Black resistance: We were the aggressors. Too loud, too combative, too Black. So rather than using the provided headlines, I’d write ones without the coded language. Although it isn’t common practice to include the names of people unknown to the public, given the long-standing erasure of Black history, I made a point to write them: George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor. But I was torn between wanting to make sure they were remembered and worrying about contributing to the idea that they were martyrs, that their deaths were necessary for us to inch closer to equity. I felt alone in the burden of making these choices, as the only Black person who would touch the stories. I don’t have all the answers, nor do I have the power to fix things on my own. None of us do. But what I have learned is that even small actions compound. Over the past year, after asserting myself more, I’ve been given more responsibilities and invited into conversations I was shut out from before. I’m no longer merely writing headlines for other people’s stories—now I’m helping to launch projects that I’m passionate about. I’m learning to be confident in my perspective, to use my voice, and to demand what I deserve.   “What’s your racial background?” my colleague messaged me earlier this year, as she filled out an application that required this information. The categories that should have felt most relevant to me were “Asian,” “White” and “Other,” yet none of them seemed quite right. “‘Other’ is fine,” I replied, before pausing. “Actually, could you put ‘Asian’ please? ‘Other’ just feels a bit odd.” For me, being biracial is wonderful and complicated. But thinking about those categories was just one example of the ways that, in a world fixated on sorting people by race, I have been made to feel too much of one thing, not enough of another or flattened under the umbrella of “Other.” As a Malaysian-British woman, I’ve always been conscious of my proximity to whiteness and the way I’m usually racialized, having benefited from white privilege for most of my life. Sometimes I’ve felt uneasy or uncertain in fully voicing my identity as Asian, a hesitation rooted in the self-consciousness that I am less likely to experience the physically violent manifestations of racism in ways that others do. I’ve come to realize that that type of thinking is a form of invalidation, of erasure, of preoccupying myself with fears about Asian hate over much-needed Asian joy. Over the last year and through covering these issues more deeply, I’ve leaned in to claiming—and celebrating—my polyphonic identities. In March 2020, I wrote about the rise in anti-Asian racism against the backdrop of the escalating coronavirus pandemic. A year later, I tried unsuccessfully to stop myself from crying at the start of an interview for a story about global anti-Asian hate crimes. It was hard to accept how little had changed in the space of 12 months. The interviewee, also a Malaysian-British mixed-race woman, could tell that I was not O.K., and we took a moment to pause before she went on the record. I let myself breathe. I didn’t need to explain or justify why. She understood and could feel it too. The past year has taught me to be more comfortable with acknowledging the privilege I hold, as well as the fact that that privilege doesn’t mean I’m insulated from racism or its painful toll. It’s O.K., it’s healthy, to be vulnerable and to embrace these feelings. A group of biracial employees at TIME came together last summer, calling ourselves “Tuta,” which means “whole” in the international auxiliary language of Esperanto. I’m trying to keep that word in mind as I move forward, to remember to feel, and be, not “Other,” but whole.  In 2017, while reporting on the Texas legislature, I attended a Homeland Security hearing held by Republican lawmakers on how to protect the state from “radical Islam.” The panel came days after a legislator sent out a survey to mosques across Texas, posing questions about their beliefs and their commitment to remain nonviolent. As the session was wrapping up and the crowd began to disperse, a white TV reporter standing next to me asked the legislator if he would hold a similar forum on radical Christian or Jewish groups. A former state lawmaker who overheard the remark cursed him out for raising the idea, and another woman nearby questioned how the reporter could even compare these religions, insinuating that Islam was inherently more violent. When I asked her how she could make that suggestion, she demanded to know how I could support the religion as a woman. The attack felt personal, but while I knew her argument was Islamophobic and wrong, I also questioned myself. I felt unprofessional for taking off my stoic reporter hat and engaging with someone’s hateful dialogue on that level. I was so flustered that I had to leave the room. Outside, a state trooper asked me if I was O.K. I said I was, and I still had a story to file, which I did later that day. But the experience showed me that we can’t always compartmentalize when reporting on our own identities. Over the last few years, I’ve realized we don’t have to. Our lived experiences are not emotional biases, but a source of expertise. I’ve reported stories about the Muslim and African ban as well as anti-Blackness within the Muslim community and brought to them a level of authority. I understand that Muslims are not a monolith, but my own experience with religion and the way hatred toward it manifests helps inform the approach I take—from the people I interview to the way I frame stories. I’ve learned that I can be a better storyteller if I think about what I would want to read, rather than trying to write every piece for a white audience. In a story about a pandemic-era Ramadan, for instance, I went beyond the “not even water?” comment Muslims so frequently hear when they tell non-Muslims they are fasting and focused instead on more nuanced experiences. I contacted Khalid Latif, the imam who often leads the Friday prayer I attend at New York University, and asked if he could help me find Muslims willing to discuss their pandemic Ramadan. Over the next few days, my inbox was flooded with more than 100 stories from those who likely trusted Khalid the way I did. One of several stories that made it into the piece was about a Muslim doctor who shaved his beard—which he’d kept for religious reasons—so he could properly wear PPE while treating COVID-19 patients. As he sat with the body of a Muslim man who had been declared dead, the doctor read him a special prayer Muslims say after someone has passed away because he wasn’t sure the patient would get a proper funeral. As a Muslim, I understood the weight of that prayer—“inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un” (“Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return”)—and that this recitation spoke to the depth of the service the doctor provided. It was an act I highlighted in my story because I intrinsically knew how it would have brought the patient’s family comfort, in a way that a non-Muslim reporter likely wouldn’t. Bringing this level of firsthand knowledge isn’t something I can put on a resume, but it’s just as valuable to my work as a journalist, if not more.   Before May 2020, I struggled to get my pitches greenlit. I had story ideas about social- and criminal-justice issues as they related to the Black population in the U.S., but they rarely moved forward. If I pitched a piece about gun violence and its impact on the Black community, I was told that there needed to be a “national peg” for us to pursue it. If I pitched a story on a police shooting of a Black person that happened in a small community, I was told it was “too local.” I was given a bevy of reasons these stories were not assigned, which made me believe I just needed to work harder and come up with better pitches. After the murder of George Floyd, there was a shift. Now I get more positive feedback when I pitch stories on criminal justice and social issues related to the Black community, and it appears that there’s a concerted effort to cover these subjects. But it was jarring to see our approach change so rapidly, from largely ignoring these stories to centering them. As a Black man in this country, I know firsthand the importance of issues like criminal justice, policing and gun violence and how many people are affected. That’s why I put the onus on myself to try to cover them thoroughly. But unless there are more diverse voices and perspectives in decision-making positions at mainstream news outlets, critical stories will continue to be left untold. It shouldn’t take a highly publicized tragedy like Floyd’s death for publications to consistently cover these problems that have negatively impacted minority communities for hundreds of years. So while I welcome the attention to these issues, I also wonder about the motivation. Did media companies wake up to the reality that so many of us have always known? Or are they trying to appear a certain way in the public’s eyes to avoid criticism? My fear is that mainstream media, TIME included, is going to move on, particularly now that the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial is in. One lesson for me this past year has been to just keep fighting for these stories. Another is that the mainstream media can’t effectively tell these stories until the leadership understands how important they are. My hope is that those who have the final say on what gets covered have truly learned that lesson. We need to be committed to regularly reporting on these topics because as recent events have shown us, they’re not going to disappear. Read More: America’s Long Overdue Awakening to Systemic Racism  Shortly after I graduated from university in 2014, I went for dinner with three college friends, all white women. When the conversation turned to job applications, one expressed frustration that her company’s recent push for diversity had made it difficult for interns like her to get hired. “I don’t think anyone should be getting a job just because of the color of their skin,” she said, turning to me. “You’d hate that too, wouldn’t you?” I still remember how my face felt both hot and numb, tension coiled hard in my chest. I felt compelled to push back on her implication that hiring minorities meant a lowering of standards. I presented the business case for including a multiplicity of perspectives, an intellectual argument for diversity, but I did not say how the conversation was making me feel. I’d entered the workforce armed with a copy of Lean In and high hopes to climb the ladder and make a difference. I soon realized that work was much like university: I was usually the only woman of color in the room. When I became an editor a year and a half later, I had the ability to make the kinds of choices I felt passionate about—to hire, give assignments and elevate voices—but I rarely saw myself reflected at the mostly white decisionmaking table. Eager to grow, I devoured books and articles on leadership, usually by white women who preached about ambition, seizing opportunities, negotiating salaries and talking in meetings. The message was clear: get the system to work for you. For many years, I tried that. Corporate diversity has always tended to reward people of color like me—well-off, highly educated minorities whose presence assuages the guilt of white leaders without requiring them to create truly inclusive companies. Any hostility I faced just became more fuel to prove myself, as if there might be a magical threshold that, once crossed, would stop anyone from implying I was a “diversity hire.” It was easy to believe I was showing up authentically at work when I was editing stories on gender and race, or speaking up if I felt our editorial choices were problematic. I found it much harder if the person I needed to advocate for was me. All good, I would say when a colleague apologized for a hurtful remark, totally fine. I might cry in the bathroom or when I got home, but most of the time I would swallow it all down, my anger or my sadness, and put on my good-soldier uniform to complete the next task. I had understood that leadership meant being strong and upbeat under pressure. Only in the past year—after equity, diversity and inclusion became a core part of my job—has it become clear that the leadership models I’ve internalized are profoundly lacking when it comes to creating an anti-racist workplace. Journalists often talk about compassion fatigue, the diminished ability to empathize when we are routinely exposed to traumatic stories and situations, as if getting hardened to the horrors of the world is an inevitable part of the job. In newsrooms, as in many offices, we’re encouraged not to bring our emotions to work. The story comes first. You are not the story. The old journalistic maxims are drilled into my psyche and I’ve lived by them, reporting on terrorism while barricaded in a Paris restaurant and editing pieces about the risks of COVID-19 to ethnic minority communities while worried for my parents, both frontline doctors. If I let myself feel all my feelings, I told myself, I wouldn’t last another day on the job. As is the case for many women of color, not allowing anyone to see my pain at work let me convince myself, and my colleagues, that I was so resilient I didn’t need support. The truth is that we can’t even begin to change the system if we aren’t talking about how the system makes us feel. Empathy is core to doing the kind of journalism that serves and reflects different communities. It’s also crucial within our own newsroom: if we want to retain the journalists from marginalized groups who are best equipped to tell these stories, we cannot expect them to leave their emotions at home. Transforming our workplaces and building solidarity has become increasingly urgent in the past few years: the #MeToo movement opened up conversations about the masculine-coded forms of leadership that led to sexual harassment, assault and bullying, while recent stories from the “girlboss” era of the 2010s showed how white women have weaponized and abused their power to create their own toxic workplaces. But knowing what behaviors to avoid isn’t the same as demonstrating the more humane model that can take its place. Perhaps that’s because we’re still forging it. In March, after a white male shooter killed eight people in Atlanta, six of them Asian women, I watched two of my closest colleagues and friends, both Asian American women, cry in calls with members of senior management. For the first time, I resisted the urge to hide my tears. I was learning from them the value of showing up with my heart, rather than just my words. It can be a radical act to allow yourself to be seen. In the weeks since, I’ve thought a lot more about the opportunity I have as a woman of color to help redefine what leadership looks like. Unlike the decisiveness or risk-taking usually associated with male leaders, strengths like vulnerability or collaboration are often described as “feminine” leadership qualities, a “softer” set of skills. This year, I’ve decided to think of them as crucial leadership qualities. I know now that holding it together is not the only way to earn respect or be seen as professional. I am having more honest conversations with my colleagues than ever before—saying when I am hurting and when they have hurt me. I am raising my expectations about how I should be treated, communicating when my colleagues are being good allies and when they are not, and listening when I might be falling short too. When I receive apologies now, I try not to swallow my pain, but instead say, Thank you, I appreciate that.   I heard the term “internalized racism” for the first time during a Chicano Studies class in college. I had not realized until then that I thought of myself as inferior because of my Mexican American upbringing, that I felt English was superior to Spanish and that I believed the closer I could align myself to white America, the better. I did all of this subconsciously and have worked to move past my own inferiority complex and internalized racism ever since. But after observing my Black and AAPI colleagues over the last year, I know that I still have much to unlearn. In August 2019 a gunman traveled roughly 11 hours to kill Latinos in my hometown of El Paso, Texas, at a Walmart where my uncle has worked for well over a decade. I was crushed for my beautiful city and for the more than 20 people who were killed. Still, though I was heartbroken and filled with rage, I showed up to work ready to report. I put on that brave, resilient front that so many BIPOC journalists have perfected to make others feel comfortable while their communities are under attack. Again, I did this subconsciously. I showed no emotion and pitched angles I knew I could report because of my connections in the city, but I didn’t push my white top editors to do anything more than what they thought was necessary. It didn’t even occur to me that I could. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, TIME published several online articles about what happened in El Paso, some of which I wrote or helped report, and though I am proud of those stories, I now know our newsroom could have done better. In print, we published a powerful cover package that used the El Paso news as a hook to talk about gun control and domestic extremism, but it did not do a deep examination of the ways anti-Latino sentiment plays out in the U.S., nor did it create space to empower Latinos. Months later, when Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis, and months after that when a white gunman killed six Asian women at spas in Atlanta, my colleagues took another approach, demonstrating the power of good and thoughtful journalism with the aim of uplifting those most devastated by these atrocities. They wrote tributes to their communities and centered the perspectives of artists, activists and those most greatly impacted. And they worked with our top editors to put these stories on the cover. My colleagues challenged norms that have existed in newsrooms across the country for so long, the kind of status quo that made me unconsciously lax about how we covered the El Paso shooting. I have to thank my Black and Asian and Asian American colleagues. When they stood up for their communities, they also showed me what is possible. And I’m not going to wait until the next atrocity to insist on coverage that empowers Latinos and a newsroom environment that allows us to grow.   The morning after a shooter opened fire at three spas in Atlanta, killing six Asian women, TIME’s editorial staff gathered online for a daily meeting to discuss how to cover the mass shooting. It wasn’t long before multiple colleagues were discussing sex work, rather than the tragedy at hand. I was speechless. After two of my Asian and Asian American colleagues intervened and others jumped in to support them, the conversation turned away from speculation based on stereotypes and back toward the humanity of the women who were killed. That day, I felt a paralyzing fear and anguish at the violence, a nadir in a long year of increased anti-Asian hate and attacks stoked by xenophobic rhetoric about the coronavirus from former President Trump. But I also felt a quiet, simmering anger that a white man who took the lives of eight people could claim that race played no role in his rampage and that authorities seemed to accept this denial at face value while ignoring the lived experience of their Asian neighbors, friends and family members. I watched as major news organizations parroted police statements that the attack was “not racially motivated” but instead occurred because the suspect who claimed he had a “sex addiction” had “a bad day.” I often wonder what TIME’s coverage would have looked like if we did not have journalists in the room who had experienced the compounding effects of misogyny and racism that come with being an Asian woman. Their voices were critical to the coverage. Within hours of the shooting, many of us had jumped online to both coordinate stories and comfort one another. I exchanged a flurry of late-night texts with a friend and colleague, trading ideas for articles and sharing our distress. One colleague aggregated resources on how to support the Asian American and Pacific Islander community; another wrote a love letter to Asian Americans. And, determined not to trigger readers with traumatic imagery, a photo editor commissioned art for TIME’s cover that pushed back against a narrative of victimhood and showcased the strength of Asian women. As an early-career journalist, I’m still learning how much of myself I can—and want to—bring to work. Growing up in Oklahoma, where 74% of the population is white and only 2.4% is of Asian descent, I frequently felt othered, unsure of myself and my place. And I am not alone. The experience of many Asian Americans is a dichotomy: we are made to feel like conspicuous foreigners, yet subliminal in the black and white tapestry of America. And for this reason, I often hesitate to speak up even when my lived experience means I can bring an important perspective to the conversation. Watching how my colleagues responded to this tragedy showed me the power in refusing to be silent—and that, even when racing to keep up with an impossibly fast news cycle, it’s still possible to lead with compassion and humanity. Read more: ‘We Are Always Waiting Our Turn to Be Important.’ A Love Letter to Asian Americans  I graduated from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in May 2020 and started working for TIME the following month—my first big-girl job—during a pandemic, amid the protests for Black lives. In graduate school, especially at a predominantly white, elite institution, there’s this pressure, fueled by a sense of competition, to go out, find your story and file it, just get it done. In hindsight, I realize that pressure was traumatizing. Less than four weeks in, I was covering an attempted double homicide in the housing projects in Far Rockaway, Queens, with no one checking in on how I was doing, even as I hung around outside of one of the victim’s hospital rooms desperate to get a quote from his mother so as not to return to class empty-handed. That semester, I also covered the murder of a Black man by his brother—where I had to sit through the horrific details in court—the brutal and fatal attacks of Black trans women, the conditions that Black and brown housing-project tenents were subject to, the impact of the Newark Water Crisis on its poor, Black residents and so much more. At every corner, I was confronted with a new trauma and at every corner I was critiqued—I should have found a better subject, I should have gotten a better quote. I felt like a shell of myself, someone going through the motions, operating on the hum of anxiety. In the same vein that Black people, and their humanity, are disregarded when their murders become viral, or when the only reflection they see of themselves in the media involves pain and suffering for the sake of storytelling, I was expected to become desensitized to the subjects I covered. I eventually broke down. I called my mom, crying to her that I didn’t have what it took to be a journalist, if this is what journalism entailed. I wanted to drop out. It didn’t help that I was discouraged from reporting on the things I wanted to cover—I was told that identity and culture weren’t beats, and if I wanted to be taken seriously, I couldn’t write about things like colorism or the natural-hair movement. When I made a complaint about treatment by a faculty member, I was told that the journalism world wasn’t “soft and fluffy” and I would have to get over it. So I came to TIME thinking that to be good at my job, I could not be vulnerable. I second-guessed my pitches and my work, worried that my ideas for culture stories and profiles would be dismissed as “fluff.” I was so relieved to be wrong. My mentor, matched with me through the BIPOC employee resource group, is one of our staff writers, and she not only helps me with the mechanics of crafting culture pitches, but she also understands the significance of the people I put forward for consideration. After one of my ideas was declined, despite our best efforts to make the case, she encouraged me to keep trying, and now I’m thrilled to be working on a profile of a South American artist for one of our biggest franchises. Advocating on behalf of yourself isn’t something you learn in school— frankly, in my experience, it was discouraged. It’s something you can only truly learn by witnessing how it’s done up close. I’ve seen the way my colleagues speak up no matter what, whether it’s to demand better working conditions through the union or to convince the higher-ups of a story’s merits. They have inspired me to advocate not only for my work, but also for myself. Over the past year, I’ve fought to become a full-time employee and to be paid a higher salary. My peers have made me a better video producer, a better journalist and, ultimately, a stronger person. So at 23 years old, as a young Black woman, I can’t say it’s been easy to cover the news. I am still faced with emotionally trying assignments; I was asked to produce a profile of Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin’s mother, in August, the week Jacob Blake was shot. And I may always have to oversell a pitch and explain the value of telling Black stories that aren’t reduced to pain or suffering. But my peers have given me a community to lean on, and a model to ensure that my voice is heard.",2021-05-13 06:30:35,‘I Didn’t Have the Privilege of Escaping.’ 8 TIME Journalists Reflect on a Year of Covering Stories About Their Communities,"news and news media,media",4419,http://time.com
344,https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/sandy-hook-promise-sounds-the-alarm-for-adults-the-kids-are-not-alright-15654560," NEWTOWN, Conn., May 13, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Missed graduations and proms. Detaching from friends and family. Staying in a bedroom for 20 hours a day. Being constantly plugged in online. These are just a few of the stressors that youth have faced over the last year due to the pandemic, leading to heightened anxiety and depression, among other new or worsening mental health struggles. This emotional situation can give rise to various forms of youth violence -- not just shootings, but also suicide and self-harm.    The kids are not alright. Learn the warning signs to prevent a tragedy. To help adults better understand the ""powder keg"" of turmoil threatening the lives and well-being of kids right now, Sandy Hook Promise released a new PSA campaign today, ""  The Kids Are Not Alright. "" Created with BBDO New York, this series of three short videos reflects the anxiety, isolation, pressure, boredom, and incessant information overload that teenagers are experiencing. It is a national call to action for parents and other caring adults: learn the signs of a child in emotional distress and get help before it's too late. ""We may think kids are resilient, but the truth is -- the kids are not alright,"" said Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise and mother of Dylan who was killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy. ""More youth are struggling with  mental health issues  and  heightened depression and anxiety  as a result of the pandemic. And it's our responsibility to listen to them, support and protect them."" Recent studies show    more than 70% of teenagers  are struggling with mental health concerns, and  one in four  has considered suicide. Suicide is now the  second-leading  cause of death among teenagers -- and these tragedies can be preventable. Even as we begin to reopen, we're a long way from going back to normal. When schools reopen in the fall, social distancing will still be required. Students will have to deal with the stress of a new school year combined with adapting to the new school environment. Many will be returning to school after suffering the death of a loved one during the COVID crisis. Their stress will continue to mount and those who already suffered trauma will be at even greater risk of suicide and self-harm. Research groups are predicting that there will be more ""deaths of despair"" related to drugs, alcohol, and suicide, as we continue to battle COVID. According to the   Well Being Trust brief , we can expect between 27,644 and 154,037 additional deaths of despair, contingent on the extent of the pandemic. The  Suicide Training and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention (STANDUP) Act , written by Sandy Hook Promise and introduced in Congress with bipartisan support, can save lives. If passed into law, the bill would provide evidence-based suicide prevention training for all students in grades 6 through 12 nationwide. Acting now to prioritize prevention resources and mental health support is paramount in preparing the difficult return to school season ahead. While mental health challenges are not necessarily a precursor of suicide or violent attacks in schools, there is a correlation to extreme emotional distress that should be taken seriously. The  U.S. Secret Service affirms  that the most effective way to prevent a school attack is by knowing the warning signs and speaking up when seeing them. Sandy Hook Promise's signature Know the Signs programs teach youth and adults how to recognize these signs and get help. About the Know the Signs Violence Prevention Programs and PSA Campaigns:To date, more than 12 million people nationwide have participated in Sandy Hook Promise's proven  Know the Signs   programs  that focus on prevention to help end the epidemic of gun violence by training youth and adults how to identify at-risk behavior and intervene to get help before a tragedy can occur. Through these no-cost programs, Sandy Hook Promise has averted countless school shooting plots, teen suicides, and other acts of violence. ""  The Kids Are Not Alright "" is the latest in a   series of ""Know the Signs"" short film PSAs  by Sandy Hook Promise and BBDO New York that include the Emmy Award-winning ""  Back-to-School Essentials "" and viral sensations ""  Evan "" and ""  Point of View ,"" along with ""  Tomorrow's News "" and ""  Monsters Under the Bed ."" Together, these productions have amassed more than 300 million views, increasing awareness that gun violence is preventable and winning numerous creative industry awards. About Sandy Hook Promise:   Sandy Hook Promise  (SHP) is a national nonprofit organization with a mission to end school shootings and create a culture change that prevents violence and other harmful acts that hurt children. Through its life-saving, evidence-informed Know the Signs prevention programs, SHP educates and empowers youth and adults to recognize, intervene, and get help for individuals who may be socially isolated and/or at risk of hurting themselves or others. Through nonpartisan policy and partnerships, SHP advances gun safety, youth mental health, and violence prevention education at the state and federal levels that protect all children from gun violence in their schools, homes, and communities.

Harris, a 36-year-old businesswoman and lawyer, shared an Instagram post on Wednesday night that was reposted several times about the ongoing Israel-Palestinian conflict.  A post shared by Meena Harris (@meena)  “One cannot advocate for racial equality, LGBT & women’s rights, condemn corrupt and abusive regimes, and other injustices yet choose to ignore the Palestinian oppression,” she posted. “It does not add up. You cannot pick and choose whose human rights matter more,” she added. Meena has, in the four months her aunt has served as vice president, managed to irk the White House. One time, she managed to ruffle feathers with the rollout of her clothing brand, which the Biden administration said she came too close to profiting off her aunt and was not allowed to produce items using the vice president’s name or likeness. The other time, she sent out a poorly worded tweet about a mass shooting. Meena’s activism left a bad taste in the mouth of many. She also happened to leave out a key fact about Hamas, the Palestinians who rule Gaza.

Talley and two other officers followed modern police protocol by charging into the supermarket immediately after arriving that afternoon. As a result, Talley likely saved several lives. “The renaming of the post office to honor Officer Talley will stand as a reminder of our community’s support and appreciation for his and his family’s sacrifice,” Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in a news release Thursday.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., toward Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., should ""probably"" be investigated by the House Ethics Committee. ""It's so beyond the pale of anything that is in keeping with bringing honor to the House or not bringing dishonor to the House. It's so beyond the pale that you wonder that is probably a matter for the Ethics Committee,"" Pelosi said during her weekly press briefing. While leaving a congressional hearing Wednesday afternoon, Ocasio-Cortez was confronted by Greene, who repeatedly shouted, ""Hey Alexandria"" to get Ocasio-Cortez's attention, according to a Washington Post report. ""You don't care about the American people,"" Greene shouted at Ocasio-Cortez. ""Why do you support terrorists and antifa?"" When Ocasio-Cortez attempted to evade Greene, the Georgia Republican shouted that Ocasio-Cortez was failing to defend her ""radical socialist"" views by not confronting her. The New York Democrat turned around once and threw her hands up in frustration at one point after Greene's goading. The Ethics Committee is a House panel charged with overseeing the proper behavior of representatives and investigating unethical or improper conduct of House members, including ethics violations. In January, Ethics Committee Chairman Ted Deutch co-sponsored a resolution calling for Greene to be expelled from Congress for comments she made in 2018 claiming that a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was staged. In February, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments after Democratic leadership said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had not taken strong enough steps in disciplining Greene for spreading multiple conspiracy theories and levying verbal attacks at fellow members. Greene responded to Pelosi's comments supporting an Ethics Committee investigation, arguing that the committee should instead investigate Ocasio-Cortez ""for putting Trump admin staff and supporters on lists to destroy their lives and prevent future employment. She threatened the livelihoods of Americans for simply being Republicans,"" Greene wrote on Twitter. Immediately after the insurrection at the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez warned that such violence could happen again without enforcing any ""accountability"" on officials who encouraged pro-Trump protests contesting the legitimacy of the 2020 election. ""Let’s be very clear,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in January. ""The officials urging for no serious consequences after Wednesday’s attack on our country - including the impeachment, removal, expulsion, and/or indictment of officials who aided, abetted, or incited the attack - are opening the door for it to happen again."" Pelosi's comments indicating that the Ethics Committee should investigate Greene's confrontation of Ocasio-Cortez would not be the first time that House members and watchdog groups have called for investigations of their colleagues in the first months of the 117th Congress. In January, watchdog groups called for ethics and criminal investigations into the conduct of Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., for their roles in the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. In March, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called for Ethics Committee investigations into the conduct of GOP Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Gosar after accusing the trio of supporting Capitol rioters in their assault on Congress. In April, the Ethics Committee announced it was launching investigations into Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Tom Reed, R-N.Y. Gaetz is currently under criminal investigation for engaging in sexual acts with a minor and paid for sex with other adult women. . Reed is accused of inappropriately touching a female lobbyist four years ago, accusations that derailed his potential bid for New York governor.

349,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/lYPrFPEiT9E/,"You're an editor or producer in a national newsroom. Two mass shootings come in over the wire. One took place inside a home...the other at a crowded grocery store. Both saw multiple confirmed deaths. Both suspects are dead. What do you cover first? And what gets the most airtime? Experts say people often perceive equally deadly mass shootings in very different ways depending on where they happen — and how random the violence seems to be. And that affects how those shootings are covered. Take a look at recent violence in one city, Indianapolis. While the events didn’t happen at the same time, the number of deaths in each fit the Gun Violence Archive’s description of a mass shooting; 4 or more people shot and or killed minus the shooter. There have been three in the city this year. One occurred on January 24: five people, one of them pregnant, killed inside a home. The second, March 13: 4 people shot and killed at a home, allegedly following an argument over a stimulus check. The third, April 15: a gunman killed 8 people at a FedEx Facility. We examined national news coverage of each shooting from four outlets, including Newsy, the day of and the following week.  Here’s what we found: Excluding things like opinion pieces, the first shooting at the home was covered 9 times. The second, covered 3 times. The third, at FedEX, 48 times. ""If it happens to people who are not like us we think OK, well, this is something that happens to those kinds of people and not to my kind of people. And so we look for ways to kind of create a distance from the event,” said University of Oregon psychologist Paul Slovic. According to Paul Slovic, a psychologist who studies risk and decision making, it’s known as Perception of Risk. Take, for instance, the 2002 DC sniper attacks. ""You didn't know where this person was going to show up next so you couldn't sort of protect yourself by staying away from the place where it's going to likely to happen. You didn't know that. And so one of the things that affects our perception of risk, is the sense of control,"" Slovic remarked. So an editorial team could make the argument that there's an unknown risk of a grocery store shooting: It could happen to anyone, and thus the audience has a greater need to know about it. On the flip side, audience members can remove their own interests if the shooting takes place in a situation or area they can avoid. ""The sort of mass shootings that we see in the news that get the live cable coverage and alerts on your phone from national news companies make up one less than 1% of shooting victims. The mass shootings that don't get covered are mostly those harming Black and brown communities,"" said Jim Macmillan, founder of the Center for Gun Violence Reporting. According to Gun Violence Archive, of the U.S.' nearly 15,000 gun-related deaths in 2021, around 200 come from mass shootings. Jim MacMillan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist and founder of the Center for Gun Violence Reporting, held a summit along with leaders across Philadelphia asking reporters, doctors and community leaders what can be done to cover all types of gun violence, public or domestic, in an ongoing, comprehensive manner. ""Journalists should take a public health response to gun violence and what that means Is to approach gun violence as the epidemic that it is, and epidemics, like all epidemics, one that can be contained and disrupted and mitigated with intervention strategies and eradicated by addressing root causes,"" MacMillan suggested. That’s contextual, humanized reporting on every mass shooting. But that can be hard given their numbers — and it can also lead to ""psychic numbing” where the audience has trouble compassionately processing so much death. However, MacMillan says it may be necessary for newsrooms in a time when gun violence is, as the CDC describes, a public health crisis.  Amber Strong, Newsy, Washington. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

351,https://dailycaller.com/2021/05/13/james-craig-detroit-police-gretchen-whitmer/,"[Left: WXYZ/Right: Carlos Osorio-Pool/Getty Images] One of Detroit’s longest serving police chiefs is reportedly considering a run to unseat Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. James Craig announced his plan to retire on June 1 after eight years on the job, according to the Detroit Free Press. “I’m leaving in a good place, I love this city and I love this state,” Craig reportedly said. Craig did not rule out a bid for governor, noting he is “deeply passionate” about public service. “I have not made that decision. I am not ruling it out. There’s an appropriate time and I will get past this and then I will come out with a decision,” he said, according to Click On Detroit. “I am deeply passionate for public service.” NEW – Detroit Police Chief James Craig, a Black Republican who’s been an outspoken defender of law enforcement in recent weeks, is prepping a challenge to Gretchen Whitmer and has met with party leaders https://t.co/I86qn8RS5k — Alex Isenstadt (@politicoalex) May 7, 2021  Craig began his career with the Detroit Police Department before joining the LAPD for 28 years, according to WXYZ. Prior to returning to Detroit, he worked as the police chief in Cincinnati, according to the report. Detroit had the highest violent crime rate among big cities in 2019 while Craig served, according to The Detroit News. In 2019, there were 13,040 violent crimes reported to police which include murder, rape, assault and robbery. While overall the city saw a three-percent decrease in crime, it still led the nation, according to the report. The crime rate for every 100,000 people was 1,965 violent crimes, according to the report. But Craig blamed the crime rate to the increase in illegal guns on the street and people not handling disputes properly, according to The Detroit News. “A lot of our violence is argument-based,” Craig reportedly said. “We’ve seen significant increases in that. It was up last year, but it’s gotten worse this year, with a lot of stress related to COVID.” Craig also blamed illegal guns, according to The Detroit News. “I’m not talking about people who purchase guns legally and have a legal license to carry. Those aren’t the people causing the problems. It’s illegal guns.” Craig also blamed a backlog in the court system and issues with prosecution, according to the Detroit Free Press. “I’m all for some kind of reform when it comes to bail, but let’s use some common sense of judgment,” he reportedly said. “Some people are sociopaths, some people are violent.” Craig also launched Project Green Light, which has come under criticism by some. Project Green Light was created in 2016 and is a public-private partnership meant to curb crime. The police department partners with gas stations that use “real-time camera connections with police headquarters as part of a ground-breaking crime-fighting partnership between local businesses, the City of Detroit and community groups.” Facial recognition is also used, with the system monitored by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and private partners. The city of Detroit says the project has been successful, with incidents of violent crime reduced by 23% at all participating sites and 48% at the original eight gas stations. (RELATED: Small Business Owner Launches Bid Against Whitmer, Says She’s Responsible For ‘People Losing Their Livelihoods’) “I think the best evidence is, first of all, crime reduction,” Craig said, according to the Detroit Free Press. “Take a look at our stats.” Some, however, claim it “disproportionately singles out communities of color,” according to Public Seminar. Others have also criticized it, equating it with a mass surveillance campaign. The program has resulted in two wrongful arrests, however. In one instance, Robert Williams was wrongly identified as a suspect in a theft and was arrested on Jan. 9, 2020 in front of his family and held for 30 hours before being released on bond, the Detroit Free Press reported. Williams sued, and Craig, the city of Detroit and Detroit police Detective Donald Bussa were named as defendants in the suit, according to the report. “Cities across the country have banned police from using facial recognition technology for a reason,” Jeremy Shur, a student attorney with the University of Michigan Law School’s Civil Rights Litigation Initiative, which is representing Williams, said according to the report. “The technology is racial biased, flawed and easily leads to false arrests of innocent people, just like our client.” But Craig has taken other approaches which could appeal to some Republican voters. Craig once expressed support for arming teachers, according to Metro Times. “I think it makes sense,” Craig reportedly said. “These mass shooting incidents, they happen between four and six minutes. Police are notified, the fastest police will get there could be as soon as a few minutes to eight minutes, and so by that time … the carnage has happened, so this is about the business of mitigating a threat.” Craig said teachers would have to go through a “very thorough vetting process” and that not all teachers would be armed. Craig has also supported having more legal guns on the street to deter crime, which could appeal to supporters of the Second Amendment. “I say that because of my experience now in my fourth city, seeing good Americans, good Detroiters that have concealed carry weapons and what effect that has had on deterring violent crime,” Craig said, according to MLive. Craig became Portland’s first African-American police chief in 2009, according to the Press Herald. While acting as Portland’s police chief, Craig created a text messaging system for bars to use in order to warn police and other bar owners about certain patrons, according to the Press Herald. He also reportedly ordered the police department to stop using Remington 700 sniper rifles because of their unproductive firing. “I don’t want to run the risk of having an accidental discharge like this where it puts an officer’s or community member’s life in danger,” Craig told the Press Herald. Craig was also praised by city officials for his commitment to community policing, according to the report.

352,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-deputies-fired-school-massacre-jobs-back-77675414,"A Florida judge has ruled two deputies who were fired for inaction during a high school shooting that left 17 dead should be reinstated with back pay FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Thursday that two deputies who were fired for inaction during a high school mass shooting in 2018 should be reinstated with back pay. Broward Circuit Judge Keathan Frink concluded that arbitrators last year were correct in ruling that the fired Broward County deputies, Brian Miller and Joshua Stambaugh, should get their jobs back, with back pay plus other benefits, the         Sun Sentinel reported. That includes accrued sick and vacation time, overtime and off-duty detail pay, among other benefits that they would have been paid had they not been fired. One arbitrator had ruled in September that Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony acted 13 days too late when he fired deputy Stambaugh in 2019 for his conduct during the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The shooting left 17 dead. State law says discipline against law enforcement officers must occur within 180 days of an investigation's completion. Another arbitrator reinstated Miller last May, saying Tony had missed that deadline by two days. The sheriff's office appealed both decisions. Lori Alhadeff, who joined the Broward County School Board less than a year after the shooting, said in a message to The Associated Press that her daughter Alyssa and 16 others are no longer alive because of the inaction and failures of many, including Miller and Stambaugh. “It is painful for me to once again see that there is no accountability,” Alhadeff said. An arbitrator has not yet ruled on the case involving a third fired deputy, Edward Eason. Jeff Bell, president of the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association, said the judge’s decision solidifies that Miller and Stambaugh were terminated improperly. The sheriff's office released a statement pointing out that the union's victory was based on a procedural technicality, which the sheriff's office maintains was wrongly decided. The agency also reaffirmed its position that Miller and Stambaugh do not deserve to have their jobs back. A state investigative commission found that Stambaugh was working an off-duty shift at a nearby school when he responded to reports of shots fired at Stoneman Douglas. He got out of his truck, put on his bulletproof vest and took cover for about five minutes after hearing the shots, according to body camera footage. Stambaugh then drove to a nearby highway instead of going toward the school. Eason ran the other way as gunfire continued, then spent time putting on his bulletproof vest and body camera while the carnage continued, investigators said. Eason also was faulted for not writing an official report after receiving a tip in February 2016 that the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, was making threats on social media to shoot up a school. Tips to the FBI about Cruz also were not followed up, a separate investigation has found. Miller was the first supervisor to arrive at the school, arriving in time to hear three or four shots, records show. Investigators found that Miller took his time putting on a bulletproof vest and hid behind his car. Cruz, 22, is awaiting trial and could get the death penalty if convicted. His attorneys have said he is willing to plead guilty in exchange for life sentence. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-13 16:55:45,Judge: Deputies fired over school massacre to get jobs back,"education and schools,suits and litigation,decisions and verdicts,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

354,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/may/14/20-military-sexual-assault-filings-up-1-marine/,"'20 military sexual-assault filings up 1% WASHINGTON -- Reports of sexual assaults among the U.S. military increased by a very small amount in 2020, a year when troops were largely locked down for months as bases around the world grappled with the covid-19 pandemic, according to the Pentagon. The annual report released Thursday showed that sexual assault reports involving service members went up by about 1%, compared with 2019 totals. According to the report, there were a total of 7,816 reports in 2020, roughly the same as in 2019. Of those, 6,290 involved members of the military and occurred during their military service -- a 1% increase over the 6,236 service member reports received in 2019. The report said the number of assaults reported by civilian victims as well as those involving pre-enlistment attacks decreased. According to the new data, the Marines had about a 3% increase in total reports, from 1,149 in 2019 to 1,181 in 2020; while the Army had less than a 1% increase, from 3,219 to 3,250. Navy reports went down by about 3%, from 1,774 to 1,724, and the Air Force saw a decline of about 1%, from 1,683 to 1,661. It is unclear how much of a role the pandemic played in the small increase in assaults last year or whether any new programs had an impact. Formal reports of sexual assaults have steadily gone up since 2006, including a 13% jump in 2018 and a 3% increase in 2019, according to the Pentagon. Marine officer charged in Capitol riot WASHINGTON -- An active-duty Marine Corps officer seen on camera scuffling with a police officer and helping other members of the pro-President Donald Trump mob force their way into the Capitol on Jan. 6 has been charged in the riot, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Maj. Christopher Warnagiris, 40, of Woodbridge, Va., is the first active-duty service member to be charged in the insurrection, the Department of Justice said. Warnagiris, stationed at Marine Corps Base Quantico, was arrested Thursday, prosecutors said. He faces charges including assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, obstruction of law enforcement during civil disorder and obstruction of justice. He was released after a brief appearance before a federal judge in Virginia. Warnagiris, who was wearing a dark jacket on Jan. 6, military green backpack, and black-and-tan gloves, pushed past police officers standing guard outside Capitol doors and forced his way into the building, according to court documents. The Marine Corps said in a statement that ""there is no place for racial hatred or extremism"" in its ranks. More than 400 people have been charged so far in the siege. Among them are four members or reservists of the National Guard and about 40 military veterans, according to prosecutors. Trial of 3 Floyd-case ex-officers delayed MINNEAPOLIS -- The trial of three former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting in the death of George Floyd will be pushed back to March 2022, in part to allow the publicity over Derek Chauvin's conviction to cool off, a judge ruled Thursday. Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao were to face trial Aug. 23 on charges that they aided and abetted both murder and manslaughter. Their co-defendant, Chauvin, was convicted in April of murder and manslaughter. All four officers also face federal charges that they violated Floyd's civil rights during his May 25 arrest. Judge Peter Cahill said he moved the other officers' trial so the federal case can go forward first. No date has been set for the federal case, but Cahill said it carries higher potential penalties. He also said he felt the need to put some time between the three officers' trial and Chauvin's because of the case's high-profile nature. The order for the delay came during a hearing on pretrial motions. The former officers were not in court, but their defense attorneys all agreed to the postponement. Prosecutors did not support the delay. Deputies fired too late, ordered rehired FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A Florida judge ruled Thursday that two deputies who were fired for inaction during a high school mass shooting in 2018 that left 17 people dead should be reinstated with back pay.

356,http://rssfeeds.indystar.com/~/652259302/0/indystar/allnews~What-is-Indianas-red-flag-law-Heres-how-it-works-and-who-is-affected/,"Indiana's red flag law is seen by some anti-gun violence experts and politicians as a national model for gun control because it targets dangerous people. It may be effective at preventing suicides, with one study suggesting that every 10 weapons seizures under the law leads to one life being saved. But the law has received a lot of attention since 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole shot and killed eight people at a FedEx Ground facility near the Indianapolis International Airport in April, before turning the gun on himself. Indiana's law was made tougher in 2019. That may have been a mistake. Hole was the target of a red flag firearm seizure in 2020. Months after that seizure, he purchased the two rifles he used in the FedEx shooting. So what exactly is the state's red flag law, and how does it work? Red flag laws — Indiana's is known as the Jake Laird Law in honor of a fallen IMPD officer — allow law enforcement to seize weapons from people they deem dangerous, regardless of whether they are committing a crime. Eighteen other states and Washington D.C. have similar laws in place. In Indiana, the law requires that law enforcement and the courts work quickly together once someone is on their radar. The court can issue a warrant for someone's weapon if law enforcement officials convince a judge that the person may be dangerous. Dangerous in this case means they present an imminent threat to themselves or others, or they are the ""subject of documented evidence that would give rise to a reasonable belief that the individual has a propensity for violent or suicidal conduct,"" according to the law's text. Red flag law: Marion County Prosecutor criticized for not using law against FedEx shooter Law enforcement can also seize the weapon from the individual without a warrant, but they have to let a judge know about that seizure within 48 hours. The judge reviews what law enforcement submits about the person. The law says it has to be an affidavit, which is written testimony describing the person's history of interactions with law enforcement. If the judge decides it's likely the person is dangerous, the judge orders law enforcement to hold on to their guns. If not, police have to give the guns back within five days of that decision. For people deemed dangerous by a judge, courts have to make a ""good faith effort"" to hold a hearing within 14 days ""or as soon as possible,"" to quote the law. At that hearing is where their case is examined in-depth. People who are targeted by red flag seizures can request a continuance of that hearing of up to 60 days, which ""shall be liberally granted"" by the judge. Judge who oversees red flag cases: Send to me first, not the prosecutor Once the hearing date comes, prosecutors present their case. They have the burden of ""proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence"" that the person is dangerous, according to the law. If the judge agrees with the prosecutor's argument, they order law enforcement to retain the person's firearms. The court also sends their name to the FBI's background check system to prevent them from purchasing a gun in the future. (They're also barred from owning or retaining firearms in general.) People who are the targets of red flag seizures can also voluntarily give up the gun in question. They may allow law enforcement to keep it, or have it handed over to a ""responsible third party"" who can legally own firearms. Those who do not want to give up their gun rights can make a petition to the judge 180 days after that in-depth hearing for another hearing, where they can argue why they're not dangerous. The person can show up to that hearing with an attorney. Depending on the circumstances of their initial run-in with police, they may use that hearing to present evidence they sought mental health or addictions support. If a judge decides after that hearing the person is no longer dangerous, their weapons are returned and they regain their right to own or retain a weapon. If a judge sides with the prosecutor again, the person can file a petition for another hearing to the court 180 days later. Five years after the initial order deeming a person dangerous, law enforcement officials have the right to destroy the firearm. That is the lingering question following April's mass shooting. IndyStar has found that prosecutors do not appear to be following through on the law in court. It also appears that in Marion County law enforcement were giving red flag petitions to the prosecutor first, when the law says that these petitions should go straight to a judge. US Senate: Expert says FedEx shooting example of 'devastating effect of a failure' In general there seem to be discrepancies in how law enforcement, prosecutors and judges enforce the law throughout the state. ""Law enforcement officers who have done this once or twice learn not to see the problem because it's a huge hassle,"" one prosecutor told IndyStar in April.

358,http://feeds.dailykosmedia.com/~r/dailykosofficial/~3/hNoKUvxKgEk/-Since-deleted-video-shows-creepy-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-harassing-AOC-and-staff-again,"On Wednesday, two Washington Post reporters witnessed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Karens) chasing and “aggressively confronting” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a “terrorist sympathizer.” It was another in a growing catalog of incidents of Greene harassing and bullying AOC. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested the House Ethics Committee should open an investigation into Greene’s actions as there is increasing evidence that Greene seems singularly obsessed with Ocasio-Cortez, repeatedly publicly challenging her to a debate over the Green New Deal, where she no doubt intends to bully rather than debate facts. CNN reporters Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski have uncovered a since-deleted video showing the now congresswoman visiting the U.S. Capitol in 2019, before she was elected to Congress. Rep. Eric Swalwell reports Greene’s spokesman harassed him in the halls of Congress today. I had a mask on as I stepped off the Floor. An aide with @mtgreenee yelled at me to take my mask off. No one should be bullied for wearing a mask. So I told the bully what I thought of his order. Predictably, he went speechless. I regret I wasn’t more explicit. https://t.co/o8j0DXWOBm   The fact that Kevin McCarthy, the House @GOPLeader, stripped Justin Amash of all committee seats for criticizing Trump, but has worked to protect this person from consequences (including pretending he doesn’t see it) tells you this is happening with the support of GOP leadership. https://t.co/10OnclroLV   According to CNN, the video begins with Greene and her gang of bullies filming themselves en route to AOC’s office saying, ""We're going to go see, we're going to visit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crazy eyes. Crazy eyes. Nutty.” Greene is accompanied by Anthony Aguero, a conservative activist who participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Aguero told CNN he was at the Capitol as an “independent journalist” but video shows he was participating by encouraging the mob on the outside as they rammed through police guards. Additional video from inside the Capitol showed Aguero inside the building. The new video below picks up at the point where they find AOC’s office and discover the door is locked. Undeterred, Greene kneels down and begins harassing AOC and her staff through the mail slot, delivering a bizarre speech that begins by mispronouncing Ocasio-Cortez, a microaggression in and of itself. Greene goes onto announce, “I’m an American citizen; I pay your salary through taxes you collect from me through the IRS because I’m a taxpaying citizen of the United States. I am a woman, I am a female business owner and I’m proud to be an American woman.” Let’s stop there for a second, because the insinuation throughout is that Greene is a true American and Ocasio-Cortez is something else. Her entire speech is dripping with racism. She proceeds with a rant about abortion and then pivots to straight bullying her. “And I do not support your socialist policies and I do not support your murderous abortion policies. As a mother of three children, I am appalled at New York’s law for abortion and it needs to end and it needs to stop now. You are bringing God’s judgement on our country and I am against it, as well as my friends. So you need to stop being a baby and stop locking your door and come out and face the American citizens that you serve. If you want to be a big girl, you need to get rid of your diaper and come out and be able to talk to the American citizens instead of us having to use a flap. A little flap [she swings the mail slot open and shut].” New: A since-deleted video from 2019 shows MTG harassing @AOC's office through a locked door. Calling her ""crazy eyes"" and telling her through the office's mailbox slot to ""get rid of your diaper"" while telling the office to open the door and come out. https://t.co/QgcJucs4o8 pic.twitter.com/ccTufF90Z9 After Greene delivered her mail slot speech, Aguero and another member of Greene’s party moved to a second office door and began taunting the staff, saying, ""You can't stay in there forever. Come out and play."" Greene’s behavior is disturbing, to say the least. And this latest video is another in a catalog of documented incidents of Greene harassing not only AOC, but other members of Congress as well—Rep. Cori Bush, who was forced to move to a different office because of Greene’s harassment; Rep. Rashida Talib; and Rep. Ilhan Omar; and Rep. Marie Newman, who has a transgender child. Of course you’ll notice Greene seems to be hyperfocused on women of color, when she isn’t harassing the white mother of a transgender child. Her racist, bullying behavior towards these women has been going on for three years now. This isn’t just toxic behavior, this is into threat territory. A House GOP candidate Trump recently praised as an upcoming ""star,"" @mtgreenee, just posted a FB photo of herself holding a gun next to images of ""Squad"" members @AOC, @RepRashida & @IlhanMN. This is a threatening message to 3 lawmakers by an incoming member of the House. For her part, Ocasio-Cortez says she has clear concerns about the mental health of Greene, who has also reportedly fallen into QAnon conspiracies. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Marjorie Taylor Greene:“This is a woman that’s deeply unwell and clearly needs some help. … At this point, I think, the depth of that un-wellness has raised concerns for other members. … I’m concerned about her perceptions of reality."" pic.twitter.com/hNDYuWj6Di The stalking and bullying behavior isn’t just targeted at “the squad.” Greene previously harassed Parkland High School student David Hogg as he lobbied for gun reform after the mass shooting at his school. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a dangerous stalker. The woman followed David Hogg, I believe under 18 at the time, with a gun screaming at him about her gun rights. Now she is doing it to @AOC. #StalkerMarj pic.twitter.com/3uj7W76KPf So, what exactly does it take to get censured or expelled from Congress? If Greene keeps it up, she’s likely to find out. We may not agree with Republicans, but none of us would stand behind a Democratic member of Congress who behaved like this toward Republicans. The floor of the House of Representatives is where debate is supposed to take place, not chasing members down through hallways and calling them childish nicknames and terrorist sympathizers. The House must address Greene’s behavior, and if the Republican Party had any ethical or moral guidance, they would be leading the calls for expulsion. There should be no room for this toxic, racist, bullying behavior in any workplace.

Large crowds are unsettling, too. On a balmy night last June, Collins and a group of friends were standing in line outside a restaurant in Uptown Minneapolis when a gunfight erupted on the crowded street, injuring 11 people. Collins was hit twice in the knee and once in the thigh. The incident made national headlines at a time when much of the world's gaze was focused on Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd and the unrest that followed. But since then local authorities have said next to nothing about what is considered one of the most casualty-laden shootings in the city's history, even as the anniversary of the incident approaches on June 21. They still have not publicly released details of the incident, offered a potential motive or named any suspects. When the gunfire started, Collins' friend wrapped her arm protectively around Collins' head. The friend was shot several times, with one bullet striking her arm. ""Not even thank God, but if her arm wasn't there, I would've been grazed in my face,"" said Collins, 23, who has a GoFundMe page to help pay for her ongoing medical bills. Things were never the same after that night, she says. After being shot, Collins was taken for treatment to an area hospital, where she was surprised to learn that she was pregnant; she later miscarried. She says the episode exacted as much of an emotional toll as a physical one. For months, she has had a recurring nightmare in which she is shot. She still gets anxious while out in public. ""I don't go around big crowds,"" she said. ""I don't like to get on the bus."" That night, Dustin Sanchez, 39, had walked down to Hennepin Avenue, which had been blocked with concrete barricades to stop the car sideshows in which drivers perform doughnuts and other tricks in city streets. The area, known for its bars and nightlife, had been more crowded than usual as nearby businesses reopened following weeks of COVID-19 closures. Hundreds of people wandered the closed off street. Sanchez remembered chatting up a couple of cops when the bullets started flying and everyone ducked for cover. ""You could actually hear them going over your head,"" he said. ""It was pretty crazy."" The incident shocked the neighborhood, he said, with many neighbors wondering how something like this could have happened. Others questioned the lack of updates from elected officials and the police. Steve Taylor, who runs the Uptown Crime Facebook page, said that residents and business owners have for months demanded answers from city leaders like Council President Lisa Bender, whose ward includes part of Uptown. ""It plays into the politics to ignore crime or downplay crime when they go around to neighborhood meetings,"" said Taylor. ""There's definitely like a black hole of information when it comes to Uptown."" The MPD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Bender said the shooting was a ""terrible example"" of the violence that swept Minneapolis and other U.S. cities last year. Bender said that in the wake of the shooting she and Council Member Lisa Goodman began reaching out to local business owners about ""planning for a safe environment for visitors, residents and employees which led to some immediate changes in business practices and city safety plans."" ""We also hosted a number of community meetings and forums about public safety throughout last year as well as meetings with business owners, business licensing and public safety staff in the health and police departments,"" she said. ""We also recognize that while this kind of shooting is more rare in the Uptown area, that our Minneapolis neighborhoods are connected and that violence in any part of the city is unacceptable."" Mayor Jacob Frey, who often has found himself at odds with some council members over the best way to address rising shootings and homicides in parts of the city, said that ""we are committed to investing in comprehensive community safety systems and supporting Chief Arradondo to break cycles of violence that impact too many Minneapolis residents."" ""The gunfire that rang out in the first few hours of June 21, 2020 was terrifying, unacceptable and will forever change the lives of those involved,"" he said in a statement. ""As a city, we were — and are — grateful the injuries sustained were not life threatening, but we need to make it crystal clear that this violence will not be tolerated in our city."" No arrests or charges have been brought in the case, which police say remains under investigation. The few details about the incident that have trickled out so far were included in a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County District Court days after the shooting. According to the affidavit, investigators reviewed video surveillance footage from the area showing a man running on Hennepin past a group of people after the initial bursts of gunfire. The man is then reportedly seen turning around and firing into Hoban Korean BBQ, where people were lined up to get inside. The affidavit says at least three other shooters unleashed a fusillade of bullets, sending bystanders scrambling and leaving cars and businesses riddled with gunfire. Authorities said they found at least 70 spent shell casings at the scene. Several witnesses were broadcasting on Facebook Live at the time and captured the chaotic aftermath of the shooting, which came amid a spate of violence that coincided with last summer's protests. In some of the videos, the sound of approaching police sirens mixed with panicked screams as onlookers searched for their friends and tried to make sense of what happened. One man's injuries left him using a wheelchair, and officials say he could be paralyzed for the rest of his life. Rumors quickly spread through the streets that the shooting resulted from a long-running beef between two rival gang members, who ran into each other in the crowd and exchanged words. One of the men eventually walked back to where his friends were hanging out, outside Hoban, apparently unaware that he was being followed by the rival or someone in his crew. A short time later, gunshots rang out. During the ensuing investigation, a police informant pointed detectives to the Facebook page of one of the suspected gunmen and said the man was affiliated with the FreeShotz, a younger, more violent subset of the YNT (Young 'N Thuggin') gang. The affidavit says that investigators zeroed in on a man they thought might be the suspect, based on similarities in height, build and hair style. They later brought the man in for questioning. They showed him a picture of the shooter, but the man denied it was him and said he had nothing to do with the shooting, according to the affidavit. It was not clear whether the man, who is only identified by his initials in the affidavit, or anyone else has ever been charged in the case. Collins, who was waiting to go inside Hoban when the shooting started, said that after months of recovery she is finally walking without a limp. ""It's kind of hard to walk still. I can't stand up too long or I can't sit down too long,"" she said. For months, she's had versions of a dream in which she is shot. ""If I have dreams like that, I believe that something is bound to happen and I believe that if I'm around and somebody starts to shooting, I feel like I may not be as lucky next time,"" she said.

The wordsmith-in-chief found himself flummoxed. It was June 2015, and President Barack Obama had been invited to a memorial service for nine Black churchgoers gunned down at a Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. But Obama, who had built his authorial brand on the back of two hailed political memoirs and often wrote his speeches longhand on yellow legal paper, couldn't find words that met the moment. ""What am I gonna say?"" The president wondered aloud in the Oval Office to Cody Keenan, his speechwriter. Obama's two terms in office had already been pockmarked by major mass shootings that came to be memorialized by the cities in which they took place: Tucson. Fort Hood. Aurora. Newtown. Now, Charleston. To make matters bleaker, more than two years earlier, in April 2013, the Manchin-Toomey background-checks proposal — which Obama had spent considerable political capital selling at the beginning of his second term — had died in the Senate by a 54-46 vote. ""Cody,"" Obama asked Keenan that week, ""do you have anything to say?"" ""I don't because we have exhausted the words,"" Keenan responded. ""There are only so many times we can eulogize victims,"" Keenan, who is writing a book about the week leading up to Obama's ""Amazing Grace"" remarks, said in a recent interview. ""I don't have anything left to say,"" Obama said earlier this year, reliving that moment in an interview with Bruce Springsteen in an episode of the duo's podcast, ""Renegades: Born in the USA."" ""I feel like I've used up all my words,"" Obama said. ""Nothing I've been able to say — whether making practical, rational arguments, emotional arguments. I've shown anger in speaking about this. I've shown sorrow, and nothing seems to have any impact. I'm out of words."" Now, six years later, so are the rest of the nation's public officials, including the mayors and their staffers whose frontline job it is to lament the lives lost to mass shootings in the immediate hours after tragedy strikes. (Eventually, inspired by the family members of the victims expressing forgiveness for the Charleston shooter, as well as by some personal correspondence with the author Marilynne Robinson about the concept of grace, Obama eventually found the words and sang ""Amazing Grace"" partway through his remarks.) More than 200 times in 2021 alone, the elected officials and staffers who have become our public grief counselors in this age of mass gun violence have had to draft remarks memorializing the loss of some 15,000 lives. That's according to data from the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as ""four or more people shot and/or killed in a single incident, at the same general time/location not including the shooter."" The Congressional Research Service defines a ""mass killing"" as ""three or more killings in a single incident."" This definition was included in the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, which became law in 2013 after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The people who must come up with words when there are no words following each mass shooting in America are increasingly at a loss for what to say. Their jobs have become tougher as political will in Congress for substantive gun reforms remains ever tenuous. ""As long as nothing's going to change, that's probably true,"" Keenan said. ""It does feel like we're starting to run out of words,"" said Zev Karlin-Neumann, the former chief speechwriter for Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign. What's more, he said, the longtime stock greeting-card phrase that once populated public remarks in the wake of tragedies — ""thoughts and prayers"" — has become verboten. ""Even sort of the most reflective way of talking about expressing the sentiment of grief is off the table because it feels hollow, and it now has been hijacked to sound like it's just a fig leaf for action,"" said Karlin-Neumann, who prepped his candidate to respond to an August 2019 shooting at an El Paso Walmart, among other mass shootings that unfolded during Buttigieg's campaign. ""As we're seeing more and more shootings, you're seeing just sort of these rote expressions of sympathy without any follow-up,"" Paul Helmke, the former Republican mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana, who became the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""That particular phrase has become off-limits,"" Sam Weaver, the Democratic mayor of Boulder, Colorado, said after 10 people, including an on-duty police officer, were murdered at a King Soopers supermarket in March. In the minutes after the shooting, Weaver, who was at a friend's home at the time, pecked out remarks on his phone. ""Words,"" Weaver wrote, ""do no justice to the tragedy that has unfolded this afternoon."" A balance of the cerebral (thoughts) and the spiritual (prayers), the phrase, in its original usage, acknowledges human loss, if not action. It has all of the personalization of a Hallmark card. In politics, the phrase dates back at least to President Harry Truman, who said in a 1950 White House Conference on Children and Youth, ""Our thoughts and prayers are with our young men who are fighting in Korea."" As an expression of public grief, specifically following a mass shooting, the phrase dates back at least 22 years to the 1999 Columbine shooting. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with you,"" read a banner made by a neighboring Colorado high school. Obama wasn't afraid to deploy the expression either. ""I'm sure I wrote it several times for him in his first term,"" Keenan said. To be certain, Obama used it in his second term, too: ""Obviously our thoughts and prayers were — are with the entire community,"" he said in response to the Fort Hood shooting in 2014. ""The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people of Belgium,"" Obama tweeted in March 2016 following a Brussels terror attack in which dozens lost their lives in bombings at a subway station and airport.  ""I don't know when it became a cliché — I think pretty much anytime after 2013, which is when we tried to get background checks through the Senate,"" Keenan said. ""That's kind of when it became absurd to keep saying 'thoughts and prayers.'"" ""Now, offering somebody who's suffering your thoughts and prayers is all well and good, but not if that's all you're willing to do,"" Keenan continued. ""If that's literally the best you can do and nothing more, that's when it's offensive."" Obama's own remarks put the phrase's demise closer to 2015. After a shooting that October at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama said: ""As I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough."" He went on: ""It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America — next week, or a couple of months from now."" Whenever the phrase became verboten, it happened for the Democrats before it happened for the Republicans. In the Trump era, the phrase remained standard fare for Republicans. Trump did a variation on thoughts and prayers in February 2018 after a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 more at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. ""My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,"" Trump tweeted. ""No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school."" Similarly, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, hewed to the hackneyed line. ""Tragic news out of Florida,"" he tweeted. ""Please keep the victims, their families, first responders and the community in your thoughts and prayers."" I asked a congressional Republican aide who is charged with coming up with remarks in these instances about the use of the term. ""As someone who believes prayer works, I don't think it's a bad thing that senators are not tweeting that they are praying,"" this person said. ""We can pray without announcing it to the world,"" the aide continued, citing Matthew 6. When did the phrase become off-limits for his principal to use? ""We have not said the phrase 'thoughts and prayers' since it became a rallying cry on the other side,"" the aide said, pointing to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting where 62 people were killed and 411 wounded by a gunman from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. Among the masses, the phrase had lost any trace of comfort it once had. After Parkland, some 20 years after the phrase had popped up on a sign outside Columbine High School, it wasn't uncommon to see protesters hoist signs that read, ""Fuck your thoughts and prayers."" Three times this year, Joe Hogsett, the mayor of Indianapolis, has had to find words following mass shootings. A graduate of the city's Christian Theological Seminary, he keeps an expanding folder on his desk of notes from seminary school with ideas he might use — sermons, reflections from theologians, Bible verses. And three times this year, he and staffers have had to draw on them. But it's been even more than that: There's the initial press conference and public remarks where government officials must share the gory details of what tragedy had befallen their community. Then there are victims' funerals and memorials to attend. At a memorial at Lucas Oil Stadium in April for victims of a shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis that left eight dead, Hogsett had already spoken at least three times about the same mass shooting. He seemed to be running out of words. ""Mass shootings too many to count,"" he said in the cavernous football stadium. ""We are weary."" ""I don't relish having to prepare, but I do understand that this is part of the responsibility,"" Hogsett said later in an interview. Not every mayor has trained as a theologian for such moments. Weaver, the Boulder mayor and a trained firefighter, said he fielded a call from President Joe Biden after the shooting at King Soopers. Biden mentioned Sandy Hook and ""talked about the feeling of helplessness that comes when you have to be a person that visits afterward,"" Weaver said. Mayors around the country and their communications staff seem to be bearing much of the weight of these shootings. ""It becomes pretty clear quickly that this has to fall on the shoulders of the mayor,"" Weaver said. Weaver worked with his city council to ban assault weapons back in 2018, but it was overturned following a lawsuit. Colorado preempts local cities from regulating firearms. Indiana does, too, leaving mayors such as Hogsett advocating for policy changes that are unlikely to happen. Thomas Cook, the former chief deputy mayor to Indianapolis' mayor, who stepped down last year to practice law, said the frequency with which staffers and mayors are responding to shootings has made the process clinical in a way he didn't like. In these types of remarks, you have ""to talk about these things that are greater than,"" Cook said. ""The problem is, nobody believes them anymore. Nobody believes that there is a human spirit that can be called upon that will stop these things."" In San Jose, California, Mayor Sam Liccardo on Wednesday faced the predicament of what to say to the world in the minutes after a gunman opened fire at a railyard in his city, killing at least eight people. He didn't use ""thoughts and prayers.""  Democrats who are interested in pushing for expanded background checks and other federal policies that could stop the violence have officially co-opted the phrase ""thoughts and prayers"" to use it on their terms. Everytown for Gun Safety's Shannon Watts, who founded Moms' Demand Action, said Everytown had launched a seven-figure TV and digital ad campaign to promote background checks, supporting a bill championed by Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. It's called the ""More Than Thoughts and Prayers Campaign."" ""There was a time when the NRA was offering its thoughts and prayers, lawmakers were offering their thoughts and prayers,"" Watts said. ""Now, the NRA is often belligerent online after its shootings. They don't even bother to pause and have that moment. They just go right into 'People are going to try to steal your guns, take your guns.'"" Watts continued: ""And then some lawmakers are just silent because they can't maybe come up with another phrase that will work in the place of thoughts and prayers. I mean, I haven't seen Lauren Boebert say a single word online about the mass shooting that just took place in her own state."" A spokesperson for Boebert did not return a request for comment. At the federal level, few have dealt with the issue more than Murphy, the Connecticut senator who said he still keeps in touch with the families of the Newtown shooting victims — almost every day. Even as he works to expand background checks with his Background Check Expansion Act, he said it's safe to say that a proposal for universal background checks can't get 60 votes in the Senate. ""But I think that there is a possibility that we'll be able to put legislation on the floor that significantly expands the number of background checks that are processed in this country, and that would save lives."" That fruitless and often quixotic task to tackle gun violence leaves even the most dedicated and verbose lawmakers with little to say, even as they continue to act. Murphy said, ""We don't get elected to Congress to express sorrow.""

364,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/17/texas-democrat-mike-collier-lieutenant-governor-dan-patrick,"Mike Collier lost out to the Trumpist Dan Patrick for lieutenant governor last time but thinks he better embodies the state’s progressive past – and future Last modified on Mon 17 May 2021 12.11 BST No football team ever lost a game, says Mike Collier. The players just ran out of time. In 2018, Collier tried to unseat the Republican incumbent, Dan Patrick, as Texas’s lieutenant governor, arguably the most powerful role in state government. He watched poll numbers trend closer and closer – until Patrick bested him by just under five points.  But Collier – a Democrat – isn’t jaded enough to turn his back on what he thinks is a winnable fight. And to him, the game’s just getting started. “We came out of the first half down by a field goal,” he told the Guardian. “Now, we’re gonna go win the second half.” When Collier was a teenager, his family moved to a small town just north of Austin. Although he decried how racism pervaded (and still pervades) much of America, he’s nostalgic for the days when Texans were at least bound by civility and preparing for the future. “The Texas that I remember then was progressive,” Collier says. “But it was a Texas-progressive, in the sense that, you know, people could do their own thing. “They could be free.” An accountant, auditor and energy expert by trade, Collier is more sports analogist and goofball than political insider. His endearing drawl sounds like a habit rather than an act, and he seems happiest poking fun at his 27-year-old son or telling dad jokes. But, as he sets his sights on next year’s lieutenant governor race, Collier isn’t kidding around. “A Democrat beats Dan Patrick, and suddenly everybody behaves differently, particularly if that Democrat brings to it our Texas values – which I do – as a Democrat, and we roll up our sleeves and start solving problems honestly,” he says. “I think it’ll change everything.” He’s not wrong. As the second most populous state, Texas accounts for 38 electoral college votes and just added two more congressional seats after last year’s census. It’s home to one of the most powerful constituencies in the union, a bloc that’s handed Republicans control over every lever of state government – at least for now. But Texas’s demography is trending younger and more diverse, generating buzz over a potential uptick in more liberal voters. A Collier victory could represent the first ripple in a blue wave that Democrats have been promising for years now. That, in turn, would transform federal politics. Next year’s election could also lead to the ousting of a conservative firebrand whose political reign has further aligned Texas with xenophobia, conspiracy theories and Trumpism. Patrick, once an outsider himself, has spent years deeply entrenched in the highest rungs of state government, pushing its politics past even his own Tea Party inclinations. After chairing Donald Trump’s Texas campaigns, Patrick has already been endorsed by the former president ahead of 2022. Trump’s support earlier this month was a much-needed boost for the beleaguered state executive, whose approval ratings plummeted to a measly 35% in April, according to the Texas Politics Project. But while Patrick was focused on Trump, Collier worked hard to elect Joe Biden last year. He endorsed Biden early in the primary season, then took on a series of duties – including a senior adviser role – to help his campaign. Collier remembers watching Biden’s launch video in 2019, during a terrible day at an energy conference. The minutes-long clip described a battle for the soul of the nation, with footage of neo-Nazis marching through Charlottesville. “Tears came to my eyes,” Collier says. “I said, ‘this is exactly what’s happening in my America.’” Much like Biden, Collier readily admits that he’s old, has white hair and wears Ray-Bans – pure coincidence, he says. And much like Trump, Patrick is the consummate showman, with an eclectic life story that’s seen biblical highs and lows. Patrick, né Goeb, went from popular sportscaster to bankrupt businessman, then eventually garnered a following as a middle-aged talkshow host. But by the mid-2000s, he settled on a career in public service, eventually ascending to the lieutenant governorship after several terms in the state senate. Now, he relies on his flair for the dramatic – used in another life to get through an on-air vasectomy – to push his conservative agenda. Patrick proudly frequents Fox News segments, where he makes sensationalized claims about the US-Mexico border and spews vitriol about immigrants, one in six of all Texans. In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, he raised eyebrows after making clear that he valued a healthy economy over human life – even his own. “No one reached out to me and said, ‘As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?’” he told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “And if that’s the exchange, I’m all in.” At times, the bellicose Patrick appears to be waging war against himself. After eight students and two teachers were massacred in a mass shooting at Santa Fe high school outside of Houston in 2018, he personally offered to donate up to 10 metal detectors for the district. But this year, that empathy ran dry when he pushed the legislature to allow Texans to carry a gun with no permit, a policy opposed by the majority of voters. “Our politics reflects the point of view of a very, very small minority of Texans,” Collier says, and Patrick “panders over there to a small crowd that don’t represent our values”. Collier’s vision of Texas is much different. He imagines a state that leads the charge against a global climate crisis, where kids line up to get into the public schools instead of trying to find any way out of them. He knows that too many young, Black men are languishing behind bars. And he doesn’t think hospital closures in Texas’s rural communities should force pregnant people to drive an hour and a half just to find an OB-GYN. “We’re a wealthy nation. We’re a wealthy state. Everybody oughta have healthcare,” he says. When he talks policy, he doesn’t fearmonger, mince words or put on a show. In many ways, he’s the anti-Patrick – or is Patrick the anti-Collier? “I mean,” Collier says earnestly, “He’s just not one of us.”",2021-05-17 05:00:19,‘We’re gonna win the second half’: the Texas Democrat eyeing 2022 victory,"politics and government,elections,blacks,public opinion,football",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Here's what we're talking about: One thing to look out for today: President Joe Biden is set to speak about the state of vaccinations at 1 p.m. ET. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.
                              

                                  (Photo by Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) 1. FED UP ON THE HILL: Democrats don't want to say Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's name. Even some Republicans feel the same way. The latest incident came last week when Greene accosted Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an incident that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called ""abuse"" and suggested the House Ethics Committee should review. Insider spoke with Greene's House colleagues, and a picture emerged of how the Georgia Republican had become something of a Voldemort on Capitol Hill. Here's a peek at what we found: Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois was one of 11 Republicans who voted to remove Greene's committee assignments: He criticized Greene's recent outburst. Greene told Insider she didn't think she lost anything since being kicked off of committees: She has introduced 11 bills so far, including legislation to slash the salary of Dr. Anthony Fauci. Some Republicans were hesitant to discuss Greene's latest incident, in which she was observed shouting at Ocasio-Cortez and falsely accusing her of supporting ""terrorists."" More on what Greene's colleagues are saying about her. 2. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects calls for a cease-fire: The most intense fighting yet unfolded Sunday, as at least 42 Palestinians were reported killed in early-morning airstrikes, while attacks continued Monday morning, according to The New York Times. Netanyahu told CBS that Israel would ""do whatever it takes to restore order and quiet and the security of our people and deterrence."" At least as early as 2015, the phrase ""thoughts and prayers"" became recognized as a cliché.

The demise of ""thoughts and prayers"": The people who must come up with words when there are no words following each mass shooting in America are increasingly at a loss for what to say. Their jobs have become tougher as political will in Congress for substantive action to reduce gun violence remains tenuous. ""It does feel like we're starting to run out of words,"" one Democratic speechwriter told Insider. 4. Bill Gates acknowledges affair that preceded his exit from Microsoft: Microsoft board members opened an investigation into Gates in late 2019 after an employee said she had a sexual relationship with him that spanned years, The Wall Street Journal reports. The board hired a law firm to investigate, and unnamed sources told The Journal at least some board members decided Gates should step down from the board. Gates did step down in 2020, but a representative denied it was because of the investigation, which The Journal said had not been finished. More on the latest to come out amid Gates' divorce here. Bill Gates crafted a public image as a likable, nerdy do-gooder: Office affairs, ""uncomfortable"" workplace behavior, and ties to Jeffrey Epstein reveal cracks in his facade. 5. Rep. Liz Cheney says there's ""no question"" another Capitol riot could occur: ""We have to recognize what it means for the nation to have a former president who has not conceded and who continues to suggest that our electoral system cannot function, cannot do the will of the people,"" Cheney said on ""This Week,"" just days after being removed from House Republican leadership for her criticism of former President Donald Trump over his refusal to stop lying about the election. Cheney said Trump's denial of his 2020 election loss was similar to something out of China. Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana.

The protests are changing the nation – just as the accomplishments are uplifting it. To celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, the USA TODAY Network asked activists, artists and newsmakers how they're embracing their heritage to help lift all of America out of hate and keep the promise of the American dream. In pulling together this project, one of us, a Vietnam War refugee as a child and now USA TODAY's opinion operations editor, took inspiration from ""Let America Be America Again"" by poet Langston Hughes. He voiced not only African American dreamers of equality but also disenfranchised whites, Native Americans, immigrants, farmers and pioneers. The other producer, USA TODAY's opinion projects editor, has long identified with Hughes' dissection of the African American fight to be seen. It's reflected in her own Black experience. May might be the month we celebrate AAPI history, but the responsibility to perfect this union belongs to all Americans – and for both of us, Hughes' words perfectly declare this ongoing mission of the United States of America: O, let America be America again – The land that never has been yet – And yet must be ... We, the people, must redeem The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers. The mountains and the endless plain ... And make America again! — Editorial Board members Eileen Rivers and Thuan Le Elston One of my earliest memories as a 4-year-old was sitting at a McDonald’s with my family when a group of skinheads began shouting ethnic slurs at us. One shouted, “Go back to your country!” Today, in America, members of the AAPI community are subject to increased harassment and even violence, fueled by hateful rhetoric. This hate has no place in America. No one should feel unsafe because of who they are. That incident in McDonald’s could have dimmed my family’s dreams, but my parents showed me every day that the promise of America was bright. Even as strangers in a new country, they saw America as a beacon to the world, a nation that promised equal justice for all, which strove to live up to its ideals and welcomed them as immigrants. Their love of this country inspired them to also teach me that we have an obligation to do the necessary work to perfect this union. And, years later, I swore an oath to do just that. Weeks ago, I was sworn in to the Justice Department as associate attorney general, the first daughter of immigrants and first AAPI confirmed to the position. And while I may still remember the slurs directed at my family as a child, I will always remember greater still the promise of America and the ongoing pursuit of equal justice that guides the DOJ work and mission. Vanita Gupta is the associate attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice. As an Asian American studies scholar and now as the director of the Asian American Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I have felt more demand and more responsibility for education about this shared heritage in the past year than ever before. I’ve spoken about my research on the history of anti-Asian violence, the model minority and the Japanese American incarceration so much that it rolls off the tongue. The academic side is easier for me; the emotional care is harder. I don’t think I ever took a moment after the Atlanta shootings to pause and reflect; I was too busy putting together a community vigil, talking to students and colleagues, speaking to the media, and answering emails on everything from family problems to advice on workplace trainings. I try to help the diverse Asian American community feel seen and supported, and at the same time, I need to educate everyone across campus, even those who resist learning about racial prejudice. When I came to live and teach in the South, I didn’t realize how much hunger there would be for this knowledge. But I connected very deeply with the history and literature of the Asian American movement at a young age, and I want my students to feel the self-confidence that comes with a better understanding of the fraught history of race in this country. They give me hope that maybe we’re not doomed to repeat it.

Follow her on Twitter: @heidikkim Each of our families, from India and the Philippines respectively, came to the United States because it held the promise of diversity and opportunity for all. Our families’ immigration stories are common, but that promise has become increasingly rare for AAPI families like ours. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are under attack right now and many times not seen as a part of America, even though we make up 7% of the U.S. population. Meanwhile, our research finds that our community receives less than .5% of charitable funding. We launched The Asian American Foundation to solve for this longstanding lack of investment and help AAPIs access the opportunity to advance and thrive in the way that all Americans deserve. As a convener, incubator and funder, it is TAAF’s aim to fill critical gaps of support. But this is also about creating cultural change. We are bringing together leaders and influencers to drive awareness of our diverse cultures and accelerate impact to our communities. To do this, we launched the “See Us Unite” campaign, which celebrates our contributions to America’s story and helps build a coalition of solidarity for lasting change. The campaign includes social and outdoor media and a broadcast special, “See Us Unite” hosted by Ken Jeong on May 21 at 8:00 PM ET / 8:00 PM PT on MTV.

Success, as a result, meant running away from my heritage so I could blend in. But after being spit on last year and being told to “go back to where I come from,” I realized hiding was impossible. I needed to speak up for myself and others like me – to fight for basic dignity. Today, fully embracing my heritage has inspired action. I leverage my career experiences in politics to push for protections and resources for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. I advise first-time political candidates. At a time where acts of hate and violence against our communities are blatant, when we’re scapegoated for COVID-19, I encourage others – including my parents – to share their stories of discrimination and fight for representation at the highest levels of our government. There’s now a political awakening within the community: record activism and a booming voice in our public discourse. Our communities no longer just accept what they’re given. They’re fighting. Our heritage is that strength – not weakness – that pushes national change. As a Vietnamese American, I’m proud to play my part. Jeff Le is a political partner at the Truman National Security Project. He served as deputy Cabinet secretary to California Gov.

Follow him on Twitter: @JeffreyDLe You picked the wrong Asian woman to mess with because my tongue is split – It is forked and steel-tipped I am a founding member of the Asian American female spoken word poetry group, Yellow Rage. As my poetry partner, Catzie Vilayphonh, and I performed around the country over the past 20 years, we sometimes met AAPIs who told us that when they first saw our performance on HBO’s ""Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry Jam"" back in 2001, they cried. They explained that the feelings and thoughts that came over them as they watched us perform were “Finally. FINALLY, someone is saying what I’ve always wanted to say.” i wasn’t talking to you, so don’t ask me what i’m saying in my native tongue you want to know so badly, go learn it yourself In our early years of touring, Catzie and I were confused why AAPI people would tell us that our piece made them cry. “It’s not that kind of poem!” We would say or think or just exclaim to each other. We were so fixated on our own expression of anger that had prompted us to write the piece, we didn’t recognize that other people’s anger was manifesting as pain. That beneath our own “Yellow Rage” – the rage that we were expressing – was a deeper representation of our collective pain as AAPI people. I see right through you – you “expert” on me with your fake Asian tattoo you “expert” on me with your taebo and kungfu Now that Catzie and I have some distance from when we first wrote that poem – and we’ve gotten older – we understand this pain more. There is so much that non-Asians don’t understand about our pain. There are so many Americans who think they know us – know ABOUT us – when they know NOTHING at all. And for these reasons, Catzie and I have been humbled and overwhelmed by the recent responses and rediscovery of our performance on ""Def Poetry Jam."" so you wanna learn how to say “i love you” and “hello” why you need to know? – cuz you think i’m some asian ho? Sadly, two decades later, our poem still has relevance. In a collaboration with Studio Revolt, an independent media lab and production company founded by performance artist Anida Yoeu Ali and filmmaker Masahiro Sugano, Yellow Rage and Studio Revolt will be releasing a short film version of our poem by the end of May for AAPI Heritage Month. Featuring members of Philadelphia’s AAPI community from young girls to elders, this re-envisioning of our signature poem will be an unapologetic declaration of our pride as Asian American Pacific Islanders and a reclaiming of our humanity in the face of the hateful forces in U.S. society that seek to tear us down. Michelle Myers is an award-winning poet, community activist and educator. As a biracial Korean American founding member of the spoken word poetry group Yellow Rage, her solo work has been published in Apiary Magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Title Magazine and Brevity. It is outrageous that in 21st century America, any of our fellow citizens and residents have to live in fear and endure attacks because they look like their ancestors didn’t come here on the Mayflower. Despite having worked at the highest levels of the federal government and having dedicated myself to a life of public service, even I am not immune to these malicious attacks, false narratives and accusations of disloyalty to America. Like so many others, my family came to America for the opportunity of a better future. My father scored No. 1 in the national examinations in Taiwan and was given the chance to study abroad. Without money or documentation for a seven-month pregnant wife and two young daughters, my father came to America alone. It took him three years before he was able to bring us to America. The initial years were difficult; we didn’t speak English and lived in a small one-bedroom apartment in Queens, New York. But my parents were confident that America was the land of opportunities. This is the dream of millions of Americans. While we are now more accomplished and integrated than before, the AAPI community is often not seen as influential. Our community possesses a collective buying power of $1 trillion, but American media, products and campaigns do not recognize us nearly enough. Within the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, there is a growing awareness of the need to be more visible and vocal. Hopefully, this Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month will increase appreciation for how America’s diversity and freedoms are, and have always been, its greatest strengths. Elaine L. Chao (@ElaineChao), secretary of Labor in the George W. Bush administration and secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration, was the first Asian American woman to be named to a president's Cabinet and the longest serving Cabinet member since World War II. In 1955, my mother radically changed the trajectory of my life when she brought me to the United States. With a quiet determination, she sacrificed and persevered to build a life for my brothers and me in this country. Everything I have achieved is a testament to her fortitude. With her heart of fire, she showed me how to stand up for myself, persevere and not back down from a fight. My mom’s life of courage and persistence showed me how a fire need not be a roaring inferno to be powerful. It can just as easily be embers – carefully nurtured and gently burning – passed from one generation to the next. Just as my mom passed her heart of fire to me, I too hope to pass on mine to others. At different moments in my life, I’ve internalized the diminished expectations the dominant culture has for Asian women. It’s a common experience for too many of us. But after four years of constant assaults on the body politic and the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and hate, Asian Americans are finding, expressing and stepping into our own power. We simply refuse to be silent. These days, I take heart in the many Asian faces I see on TV, in politics and in the streets fighting for our future. And in seeing them, I know that though I might have been the first Asian American woman to reach the United States Senate, many more will follow. Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawaii, is the author of the new memoir ""Heart of Fire: An Immigrant Daughter’s Story."" Follow her on Twitter: @maziehirono Soon after Donald Trump’s inauguration, I learned something that felt like a kick to my gut. Asian American and Pacific Islanders had one of the lowest voter turnouts among racial groups in the USA. This fact haunted me for months. Why wasn’t I aware that my own community wasn’t going to the polls? And if more of us had turned out in 2016, what would have been the outcome of the presidential election? With Georgia’s AAPI population soaring and our state’s historically ruby red electorate gradually turning purple, I threw myself into mobilizing AAPI Democratic voters. During Jon Ossoff’s 2017 congressional campaign, I came to understand the barriers that kept AAPI voters home. Some felt ignored by elected officials. Others had language barriers that made navigating elections difficult. Still others felt as if their votes didn’t matter. But from Ossoff’s congressional race, to Stacey Abrams’ 2018 gubernatorial race, to the 2020 presidential election and 2021 Senate runoff election, I witnessed, firsthand, an astounding increase in AAPI voter participation. I watched our community come out of the shadows, seize electoral power and elect several AAPIs to the Georgia legislature, including Sens. Sheikh Rahman and Dr. Michelle Au, as well as Reps. Sam Park, Marvin Lim and Bee Nguyen, the daughter of Vietnamese refugees who recently announced her Democratic candidacy for secretary of state. A win would make Nguyen the first AAPI elected to statewide office in Georgia. This past year has been a huge one for AAPI Democratic voters, who have helped oust a vicious, white supremacist administration. And though we have a lot more work to do, we will continue to make our voices heard by getting out the vote and building coalitions with others to shape our nation into one that is more compassionate, humane and just.

I’m from Guam and proud of being native Chamorro. Because Guam is a melting pot of people, I’ve always had friends from diverse backgrounds. Kindness and respect are intrinsic to my culture. With the increase in hateful and unjust acts targeting friends’ communities nationwide, advocating for social justice is a priority for me. I try to help affected communities however I can – by giving donations or using my voice. I’ve found additional ways to channel my efforts. At 2U, Inc., the education technology company where I work, I belong to the Asian Pacific Islander Network. In addition to cultural celebrations and informational workshops, APIN has provided virtual “safe spaces,” or open forums, for members whose communities have been targeted by violence. I show up at events sponsored by APIN and other employee networks, even if just to turn on my camera to let people know that I see them and I hear them. I’ve also joined two task forces in my department that focus on diversity and inclusion. I lean on my Chamorro heritage to practice the warmth, hospitality and generosity of my culture to support loved ones, friends and colleagues. Growing up in Guam gave me empathy – something everyone could use. Ask me where I’m from, and I will tell you my American Pacific Islander story. Lorena Blas is a content marketing writer. She previously worked as an editor for the Life section at USA TODAY. My first day of high school in New York I was talking to this girl. We were becoming fast friends. And when she heard I was Filipina, she had a hard time reconciling the Filipina she was expecting to meet with the person in front of her – someone who was into theater and obsessed with Stephen Sondheim, Chekhov and old movies just like her. She expected the girl to be accented, small and not have curly hair, maybe? She looked at me and said: ""Wait there's another girl from the Philippines starting school here!"" Many Asians have had versions of this from even the most well-meaning of people. The “you speak English so well,” or, alternatively, the “I mean, you’re like basically a white girl,” that even at 16, my friend's words didn’t surprise me. ""That’s me,” I said. She blushed and I laughed and then we were both laughing. Was it a micro aggression? Sure. Was it a completely innocent adolescent mistake? Totally. Did she become one of my closest friends? Yup. I got to expand her view of what a Filipina is just by proximity – by her getting to know me, all of me, and not forming a basis of understanding solely from inaccurate media stereotypes. I now write TV, and challenging those stereotypes and representing our community in a more complete way is a huge part of my daily agenda. In many ways, that moment in high school readied me for the task of this (and puzzle therein). For the bosses who’ve repeatedly asked, “What are you, again?” For a business that sometimes feels like it cares about “diversity” when it’s trendy but often leaves us wanting. For a director of equity and inclusion at a place I once worked, starting a phone call with me saying, “As a woman of color I just want to explain to you ...” Because for so many, Asians weren’t part of this conversation until concerningly recently. All of this born out of a similar thing to my 11th grade meet cute but slightly trickier. With this, though, comes the opportunity and privilege to write about our community and reach people who maybe didn’t become best friends with a Filipina girl in high school, and this is never lost on me for a moment, either. Rochelle Zimmerman is a writer, actor and producer based in Los Angeles, where she is a writer on ABC's ""Station 19."" I write novels, essays and lyrics, all of which are a refraction of my lived experiences in this country. Since 1975, when my family came here as Vietnamese refugees, my America has included North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Connecticut, California and New York. Of these divergent locales, I’ve claimed the South as my regional identity because it was at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains where I began my love relationship with English and where I began to understand that, no matter my languages, I would remain an outsider here. Among the flutter of dogwoods and cardinal wings, I learned what Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have long been told: This land is not our land. I’m headstrong, so this early lesson in preclusion made me want to write myself, my family and my community’s stories deep into the soil, claim it – and call it ours. I’m not the only AAPI woman writer with Southern roots. In the days after the March mass shooting of eight Georgians, six of whom were women of Asian descent, I gathered our works here. Because we were in mourning and no one should do that alone. Because we knew the terrain better than most. Because our stories cannot bring back the dead, but our stories can bring together the living. Monique Truong, vice president of the Authors Guild, is a Vietnamese American novelist, essayist, librettist and intellectual property attorney based in Brooklyn, New York. Her most recent novel is ""The Sweetest Fruits."" Follow her on Twitter: @Monique_Truong May is AAPI Heritage Month, when we recognize the contributions and achievements that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made to our nation. While we take this opportunity to celebrate our rich history, we must also come together to acknowledge and reckon with our nation’s long history of anti-Asian racism, violence and exclusion that is also a part of the AAPI experience. AAPI Americans have long been the victims of racialized violence and discrimination. Our heritage is part of who we are. It shapes our experiences and perspectives. We, and that troubled history, are both woven into the American fabric. In Illinois, we are working to pass the Teaching Equitable Asian American Community History Act. If signed into law, Illinois would become the first state to require all K-12 public schools to teach a unit of Asian American history, which is too often overlooked in classrooms. TEAACH ensures that Asian American stories and experiences are uplifted at a time when anti-Asian racism, discrimination and xenophobia are shamefully common. A lack of representation in curriculum, positions of power and media leads to miseducation. Empathy comes from understanding. We cannot do better unless we know better, and the best weapon against ignorance is education. Rep. Jennifer Gong-Gershowitz (www.facebook.com/GongGershowitz/) and Sen.

Cecilia Chan’s voice trembled as she spoke to the crowd of more than 800 people at the Stop Asian Hate rally in Tenafly, New Jersey. It was the weekend after the mass shootings in Atlanta that would claim the lives of eight people — six of them Asian women. The Tenafly rally would be the first of more than a dozen in North Jersey in the ensuing months, sparking a rallying cry in this enclave of Asian Americans. It took a pandemic and a mass killing to bring the Asian American movement to the forefront. Tens of thousands of Asian Americans and their supporters have mobilized at rallies throughout the nation. It was clearly uncomfortable for Chan to speak publicly about her pain. We Asians put on a brave face and do not complain because that is our culture. Work hard, stay humble and keep your head down is the playbook for Asian immigrants assimilating to life in America. We're the ""model minority,"" yet we are also perpetual foreigners in the eyes of many. As an immigrant journalist covering Aian issues, I've heard from speakers of all ages at rallies. Across New Jersey and the country, Asian Americans have reached out to me to share their own stories of racism. I’m proud to provide a platform. The vicious crimes committed against Asian Americans as we are being scapegoated means we can no longer be silent. It has been a struggle due to our upbringing, but we are finding our own voices, speaking out when it is personally uncomfortable. It’s a watershed moment in history, marking the first civil rights movement for Asians in America.

Follow her on Twitter: @marychaostyle I did not know how much I longed to be seen until I was not. I spent much of my life wanting to be able to look at someone else in the room and know they knew what I was thinking or feeling from a space of shared lived experiences. I was often landing in spaces where I feel like an outsider with white folks coming to me to share their “Asian” stories. Some would ask me where I am from, and when I would answer ""Boulder,"" they would be dissatisfied and would follow up with: No, where are you really from? What is also deeply ironic to me is that the question of where I am from is also at the center of my artmaking. The fractals of my identity are in constant push and pull with each other – child of immigrants from Taiwan, a lineage embedded in fleeing, parents who achieved what folks might perceive as the “American dream,” landing in a completely white-dominated space, moving and searching for where I belong – and translated through my work as a choreographer and artmaker. I make work for my niblings and the next generations of Asian Americans who I hope do not have to do mental gymnastics in order to belong and to celebrate who they are and where they come from. Waeli Wang, a movement artist and filmmaker, is a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Theatre and Dance at the University of Kansas. As a poet and creative writing teacher, I’m celebrating AAPI Heritage Month by fully embracing a basic writing lesson: The specific is the key to the universal. That is, describing the cantaloupe chunks your mother nested into your childhood lunch containers is more powerful than stating, “My mother was caring.” Resisters argue: “But the reader’s mother might have shown care in different ways. ‘My mother was caring’ covers all the possible ways.” It does, but a “caring mother” is an idea. The mother who does cantaloupe Tetris on school mornings is a person. I’ve known this principle for decades, but it took a pandemic and its fallout to reveal that in my own poems, I had been putting mental asterisks on details that gesture toward Asian American identity. The asterisk said: You just used another from your allotment. Too many overtly Asian American poems, and the majority of readers won’t connect. The last 15 months have brought immense tragedy. They have also brought people of every race out in support of Black and Asian lives — people who do connect. My celebration is a minute adjustment, such as a dancer or surgeon makes after years of practice. I have deleted the asterisk. The page is ripe with possibility. Adrienne Su’s most recent books of poems are ""Living Quarters"" and ""Peach State,"" which focuses on Chinese Americans in her native Atlanta. Recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship, she teaches at Dickinson College. Growing up in Michigan, Ohio and Connecticut, I was one of only a handful of Asian kids at school and was ashamed of my heritage as the daughter of immigrants from Taiwan and Hong Kong. There was even a time when I yearned to be white. This way kids wouldn’t make fun of my eyes and the foods my mom made me for lunch or roll their eyes when I proved to be quite bad at math. When I started working, I began to understand the meaning of representation. As the first Asian American to hold a primary anchoring role in three stations in the Midwest and the South, it wasn’t just about showing up and being the token Asian face. With representation comes responsibility to use your voice to make change. Especially when Asians are grossly underrepresented in managerial and C-suite positions. It was a chance to educate others when microaggressions happened in the workplace. It was learning to speak up for the stories that matter to the AAPI community, however small that population might be where I worked. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, and I saw people who looked like me and my loved ones under attack, I felt an overwhelming need to use my platform as a reporter and anchor in San Francisco to give these victims a voice. Turns out, sharing my own stories of struggling with my identity on social media and on TV gave others a way to relate. Many felt like outsiders, too, even living in the Bay Area where 1 out of 3 people are Asian American. As I made my own heritage story known, others began feeling empowered to tell their stories. They’re now holding rallies and speaking out, and the world is taking notice! This has encouraged me to keep telling stories even on those days when it feels like the hate and racism will never end. Now my heritage is worn like a badge of pride. One I’m grateful to share with the world.

Born and raised in the South, I suppose my “heritage” is that I have had to prove myself over and over again. Politely. Yet, my family believed that we belonged here, that we don’t have to remain silent to bigotry, despite messages from white Americans telling us to go home, even after we correct their English. Lately, civility has all but disappeared in public discourse. Between the pandemic and the previous president’s hateful rhetoric unlocking the door to white nationalism, it is open season against people of color, including AAPIs. But I refuse to play trauma Olympics, where the dominant culture pits one minority group against another. America’s beginnings are bloody and racist, and until all Americans acknowledge the suffering of Indigenous peoples and the enslavement of Black Americans, until we learn about the mistreatment of immigrants and women, we cannot have a dialogue about the future. So in the wake of verbal and physical attacks, police brutality and gun violence, it is essential that we stand with groups like Black Lives Matter; that we call on lawmakers to bring hate crimes to justice; that we behave with compassion and immediately answer the pleas of countries like India. My heritage as a hyphenated American is to amplify the voices of the vulnerable and to bring attention to those who bravely speak of America’s shortcomings. Devi S.

Asian women, in particular, are viewed through the lens of the Model Minority Myth, which paints us as submissive, obedient, polite and definitely not one to upset the apple cart. By telling my story, I bring forth my heritage to give voice to and uplift my community and family. Telling our stories is a critical exercise for all marginalized voices. In so doing, I believe we refuse invisibility, demand to be seen, engender empathy and with empathy, humanization.

The caption read, simply: ""Who wants it?"" The answer, it seems, is nearly everyone. More than ever, Kentucky, and Louisville in particular, is awash in guns — both legal and illegal. Some estimates suggest slightly more than half of Kentucky’s 3.5 million adults live in a home with a firearm, and thousands of weapons are being carried on Louisville's streets or in vehicles. How easy is it to get a gun in the state's largest city? “It’s real easy,"" said another young man, who like his younger friend didn’t want to give his name for fear he could become a target for retaliation. ""Say if I got into a beef with somebody, and I just need me a little pocket model. I can go to my block and walk up to somebody I know and be like, ‘I’m trying to get a gun. You know where I can get one?’ He can point me out."" The easy access to firearms coupled with Kentucky’s minimal gun controls are pushing Louisville’s violence to historic heights: 160 people dead, 587 wounded in shootings last year. Another 58 have died and 216 have been wounded in shootings this year. “The accessibility and saturation of guns has skyrocketed,” said Louisville activist Christopher 2X, who arranged an interview with the two teens for an unvarnished glimpse into the city’s illegal firearms market. ""Young people know they can get weapons, and so they know the best way to have respect and show power through the streets is by letting that gun off."" To better understand the ways in which weapons are falling into the wrong hands, The Louisville Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, spent nearly a year interviewing police, lawmakers, gun violence victims, gun dealers, gun owners and community leaders. The Courier Journal also examined thousands of public records — some previously shielded from the public. The Courier Journal found four main weapons pipelines that fuel crime and rising gun violence, with Kentucky unable — or unwilling — to stop it: The lasting damage caused by these weapons disproportionately afflicts the city's Black residents, who make up less than 25% of Louisville's population but accounted for roughly 80% of last year's shooting victims. The deadly toll goes further. Kentucky also has one of the nation’s highest rates of firearms suicides, losing somewhere around 460 people a year for the last 10 years. These grim statistics do not include the harm done by armed robbers who never fire their weapons, or the lasting trauma faced by generations of families who have had to bury loved ones, or who live in neighborhoods where gunfire is an almost nightly occurrence. They also don’t capture the steep economic burden of these shootings in a state that already ranks among the nation’s poorest. A 2019 Congressional report estimates that gun violence costs Kentucky roughly $3.6 billion a year, equal to about $800 per resident. The violence Kentucky’s guns inflict spreads far beyond its borders. In 2019, more than 2,300 guns first purchased in Kentucky were recovered at crime scenes in 43 other states, The Courier Journal found by analyzing data from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which traces guns tied to criminal investigations. That makes Kentucky the eighth largest per-capita exporter of guns traced by the ATF, the analysis showed. ""We’re promoting a gun environment and a gun culture,"" said state Sen. Gerald Neal, D-Louisville, ""and what does result from that is gun injuries and fatalities."" The young men who talked to The Courier Journal about guns, who were 18 and 19 at the time, grew up in a predominantly Black part of the city, where disproportionate rates of gun violence and poverty underscore decades of structural racism and neglect by city leaders. People in their neighborhood carry guns to fit in with their peers or to feel a sense of power or control, said the men, now 19 and 20. Others believe they need to be armed so they can safely walk home from school or work. ""You can't be in a gang, or around a gang, without a gun,"" one young man said. In their short lives, the young men say they've known too many people killed or wounded in shootings, and many others who have pulled the trigger. The younger of the two nearly died several years ago when a bullet tore through his stomach as he was caught in gang crossfire. He doesn't see an end to the violence. “I don’t see how you’ll be able to stop this gun situation,” he said. “Guns will be on the streets forever.” When they were younger, the brothers of one of the Louisville teens would tell stories about people cutting the locks on boxcars and finding caches of weapons to steal. He never met anyone who did that. In his neighborhood, he said, people didn’t need to. Break into any home or car in Louisville and, odds are, there will be a gun to steal. For years, city officials and law enforcement have sounded the alarm about the problem of stolen guns, crafting social media campaigns pleading with gun owners to secure their weapons. Those pleas, records show, have been largely ineffective. In Louisville, nearly 10,000 guns were reported stolen between 2014 and 2019 — an average of four guns stolen every day. And those are just the ones police know about. Across the U.S., an estimated 40% of all guns stolen are never reported to law enforcement. Because Kentucky is one of 37 states that does not require individual gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms, the total number of weapons taken in Louisville over six years could be closer to 16,000. A handful of Democratic lawmakers have introduced bills over the years requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms, or to penalize gun owners for failing to responsibly store weapons. No legislation has made it out of committee. Louisville leaders can't adopt a similar city ordinance because Kentucky law prevents municipalities from passing gun laws locally. ""We can’t even use the word ‘gun’ or ‘firearm’ in any of our legislation,"" said Louisville Metro Council President David James. Meanwhile, the number of guns swiped from homes, cars and businesses in Louisville keeps piling up. No target, it seems, is off-limits: Shortly after 9 a.m. July 7, 2017, Louisville police were called to investigate a theft at a familiar place: the department’s firearms training center. Eight shotguns, a handgun, five pepper-ball guns and two grenade launchers — worth $8,953 — were reported stolen. None appear to have been recovered. In November 2016, thieves popped out a window air conditioner to get into an apartment and pried loose a safe mounted to the floor and wall. Stolen were 26 guns — most rifles and shotguns — worth $6,525. Three have been recovered: One in Indiana, one in Illinois and the third in Louisville. In December 2014, thieves cut a hole in the fence and roof of a pawn shop, stealing 46 guns valued at $8,527. About half have been recovered, including one a 17-year-old tried to sell at a Taco Bell, two by police in Chicago and Indianapolis and one at a different pawn shop in Louisville. Not yet 21, the two Louisville young men who talked to The Courier Journal are too young to legally buy a handgun. No matter, they said, all they’d need is a couple hundred dollars cash and the right friends. “We could call the pawn shop and see how much the gun is first,” said one of the young men. “I need a Taurus 9. Bam, it’s $250. I can get a 21-year-old my money. ""He goes in there and gets the gun and brings it out to me.” There are around 1,600 federally licensed gun dealers in Kentucky, according to a recent ATF report. Roughly 100 are in the Louisville metro area, each potentially susceptible to a straw-purchase attempt. Simply put, a straw purchase happens when those unable to pass a background check, or who do not want a gun registered in their name, get another person to buy a gun for them. Anyone buying from a licensed gun dealer must fill out a form that, among other things, asks if the person is the actual buyer of the gun. Falsifying that form is a federal crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Known in law enforcement circles as “lying and buying,” straw purchases are a significant source of crime guns, said Shawn Morrow, special agent in charge of the ATF’s Louisville field office. Nationally, it’s estimated that upward of 30,000 attempted straw purchases happen each year at federally licensed gun shops, according to the gun-safety organization Giffords Law Center. At Kentucky Gun Co. in Bardstown, owner Patrick Hayden estimated his staff turns down a sale or two a week based on a suspicion the customer is there for a straw purchase. ""Our livelihood depends on guns getting to legal, law-abiding gun owners,"" he said. ""We don’t want those guns getting to people who shouldn’t have them."" Prosecuting straw purchasers is tough, particularly with Kentucky’s limited gun laws. A suspected straw purchaser can say they no longer have the gun because it was stolen — something gun-safety advocates say could be fixed with mandatory lost or stolen firearm reporting laws. A straw buyer also could say they sold the gun to an unknown buyer. Kentucky doesn't require background checks for private gun sales — or any forms at all to document a sale. Straw purchases are one way federal authorities say the Victory Park Crips street gang armed itself. In a sweeping, 40-count indictment from 2017, prosecutors accused a gang associate of buying four handguns from a Louisville gun shop for gang members with felony convictions. But there’s another, often easier way for people who cannot legally own a gun to buy one. It's called the “gun show loophole” — buying a weapon from a private seller without a background check. It’s perfectly legal to sell a gun without a federal license, and in Kentucky and 27 other states, only federally licensed firearms dealers are required to perform background checks on buyers. Federal law says someone has to be ""engaged in the business"" of selling firearms to need a license, but it doesn't say how many guns must be sold to need one. “You could have a collector who has 700 guns and decides, I’m done, I don’t want this, and I’ll liquidate my collection,” said Karl Stankovic, a retired ATF agent who once led the Louisville field office and now volunteers with the gun-safety advocacy group, Moms Demand Action. Those private sales often take place at gun shows. But they’ve also found a vast, welcoming home on the internet. The one Louisville teen only needed a few seconds to find a gun for sale on Snapchat. “I could have slid up and asked how much, or what you selling it for?” he said. “Or do you want to trade?” He said he also could have checked on Instagram, where people sometimes use the site’s “stories” feature to sell guns because, like Snapchat, those posts disappear after 24 hours. “When people post it on their stories,” he said, “they say, ‘Who wants to buy two 40s (.40-caliber handguns) or a 40 and a 9 (millimeter) for sale?’ They’ll say they have both guns for $700.” In early 2016, Facebook, which also owns Instagram, announced a ban on private sales of guns and ammunition on both sites. Three years later, though, The Wall Street Journal reported on how users of the social media giant’s popular Marketplace feature easily sidestepped that ban by advertising gun cases or boxes for sale, and then offering the gun as well during subsequent private messages with would-be buyers. A Courier Journal review of Marketplace found similar questionable posts still exist. An advertisement in Louisville, for example, sought $850 for a Glock G33 handgun case (similar cases sell for between $20 and $50 online). There are also websites like Armslist.com, which bills itself as the ‘world’s best firearm classifieds,” selling everything from pistols to rifles and grenade launchers. The website’s terms of service put the onus on users to follow gun laws. ""I understand that ARMSLIST is NEVER involved in transactions between parties,"" reads the second term. That didn't stop two men, Christopher Henderson and John Phillips, from using the website to buy nearly a dozen handguns from Kentucky sellers, according to a 2018 criminal complaint accusing them of helping resell those — and many other guns — in the Chicago area. Federal authorities believe the pair bought at least 80 guns in Kentucky that were later taken at crime scenes or traffic stops in the Chicago area, some days or weeks after they were first purchased. One of those guns was used to kill a 15-year-old Chicago boy 42 days after it was sold, the Chicago Tribune reported. But in Kentucky, even if police do take a gun off the streets, a state law meant to help cops buy life-saving equipment means that gun could end up back in the hands of a criminal. On Jan. 20, 2016, a .40-caliber Glock handgun surfaced on a Louisville road, where Aaron C. Williams, a 26-year-old father and former high school basketball standout, was found shot to death in a car — one of three people killed that day. Exactly one year later, Louisville police found the same gun six miles away while investigating a report of shots fired at an apartment complex. It resurfaced in Louisville a third time in October 2018, sticking out of the waistband of an 18-year-old spotted by a police officer going inside a corner store. It’s unclear from police reports how the gun made its way to three different crime scenes, three years apart. But by June 2019, it was sold at a Kentucky State Police auction for $250 and recirculated back to the public. For the last two decades, Kentucky law has banned police departments from destroying the guns they take off the streets. If the weapons can’t be returned to their legal owners, they’re sold to federally licensed gun dealers at state police auctions. More than 25,000 guns have been sold at KSP auctions since 2014, records show, raking in nearly $7 million. A fifth of the proceeds go to KSP. The rest goes to the state’s Office of Homeland Security as grant money for police departments to buy body cameras, guns, ammunition, Tasers or body armor. To the auctions' critics, the irony is frustrating — police selling guns to buy equipment to protect themselves from being shot by guns. Supporters, though, say the guns are sold to licensed dealers and are no more likely to end up in the hands of criminals than any other legally sold gun. But it does happen. A Courier Journal review of state police auction data and LMPD records found more than two dozen examples of guns sold at a KSP auction and later confiscated by Louisville police. “The state has put itself in the position of a gun dealer,” said state Sen. Neal. “They have exacerbated the situation by putting more firearms back into circulation. It’s highly inappropriate. “But again, it’s consistent with this whole thing. The guns don’t cause these problems. The people cause these problems. That’s the typical refrain. Any child knows if you put dangerous instruments in front of people of ill will, they will be used for that purpose."" The Second Amendment for many Kentuckians is seen as an insurance policy against tyranny and as a divine right. Some observers wonder whether there will ever be the political or public resolve to slow the proliferation of illegal guns. “The gun culture in Kentucky is strong,” said Neal. “The gun lobby is strong. They feel if you raise the specter of a gun in any legislation, this is the camel’s nose under the tent, and it will lead to other restrictions.” In 2013, amid a national reckoning over firearms access following the Sandy Hook school mass shooting that killed 20 children and six adults in Newtown, Connecticut, lawmakers in Frankfort introduced a sweeping gun-safety bill that, among other things, called for expanded background checks and limits on the possession of assault weapons. The bill never made it out of committee. More recent efforts have been equally unsuccessful. Instead of increasing gun controls, Kentucky has stripped them away. In 2012, the state strengthened the law that stops local governments from passing gun laws, striking down efforts to prevent people from bringing guns on city-owned properties such as libraries and zoos. And by early 2019, coming off a year in which more than 200 people were killed or injured in mass shootings in the United States — including two dead and 14 wounded at Marshall County High School in Kentucky — lawmakers made it easier for people to carry concealed firearms in the state by eliminating the need for a permit or a background check or safety training. Know someone interested in guns in Kentucky? Share this story All that has left law enforcement to chase after people with illegal guns, filling up prisons and jails while the guns themselves stay in public circulation. “You have some who are of the school of thought that we’re so saturated with legal and illegal guns,” 2X said, “that the eradication process is pretty tough."" To be sure, even the fiercest supporters of gun-safety laws recognize those measures alone will not completely stop gun violence. Protests over the police killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville focused largely on tearing down systemic racism that often leads to poverty and violence, while a recently announced violence intervention program in the city is trying to bring social services to those most likely to be the victims or perpetrators of shootings. In the meantime, the body count keeps climbing: One person shot every 12 hours in Louisville — 747 men, women and children — cementing 2020 as the city’s most violent year on record. The two young Louisville men who talked about the ease of getting guns understand they could be the next victims. The one who got shot was only 13 when it happened. Now, he and his friend shake their heads in dismay as they watch YouTube videos of neighborhood kids that age holding guns and rapping about pulling the trigger. ""When we pull up on your block you know that we f--- you up ""Pull up on your block let off 30 shots ""Your body drop ""They gonna need a mop"" “It’s a lifestyle,"" one of the young men said of the video. ""You drop out of school, try selling drugs. You just lose hope, so you really don’t care what anyone else thinks about you.” But where hope is absent, guns are everywhere. “I can’t say one year I’ve grown up that I haven’t been around guns in the hood,” said one of the young men. “It’s all just normal to me.” Follow reporter Jonathan Bullington on Twitter: @jrbullington.

368,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestheculture/2021/05/17/from-hollywood-to-government-how-millennials-are-changing-economics-in-america/,"Millennials are rewriting the rules on what it means to thrive economically in America. Millennials are the offspring of Gen-Xers and Baby Boomers—generations who have a zombie-like, over-reliance on mutual funds, large-cap stocks and Social Security. As they matured into adulthood, these generations could still afford houses, cars and higher education without crippling debt. On the other hand, many Millennials feel they never had the opportunity to put blind trust into Wall Street or ""The System,"" instead having to fend for themselves. According to the Pew Research Center, Millennials, unlike their older counterparts, have little to no confidence in many of the key institutions that make up America society, including: corporations, government, law enforcement and institutions of faith. Hollywood screenwriter, showrunner and former producer for HBO's hit comedy-drama series Insecure Ben Cory Jones is one of those Millennials. ""We have seen our parents take what was given to them, and for our generation, that isn't an option,” says Jones. Jones has created his own opportunities by making space for more screenwriters of color in Hollywood and sharing his experiences. His goal: to ensure there are more writers, producers and showrunners to tell Black, queer and diverse stories. “Changing America is going to take a collective, and our generation is doing it. Shows like Insecure are changing the game by making it OK to see Black people living their daily lives on TV,” says Jones. “Now, we are taking on Hollywood and ensuring that the industry sees our talent and our people as marketable content. Once the door is open, we can change the entire industry and how the economy sees us as a generation and a race of people.” Millennials weren’t shaped by a singular event, but numerous ones. Starting with the Challenger explosion, every couple of years has brought defining moments to the generation. The mass shooting at Columbine and the proliferation of mass shootings in schools and public areas, the Real World and reality television, the September 11 terrorist attacks, Hurricane Katrina and the consequences of climate change, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of the Internet and social media, the election of the first African-American president, the Great Recession, legalization of gay marriage, George Floyd and ongoing police brutality and now the global Covid-19 pandemic. Any one of these events could have defined an entire generation, but drastic shifts in culture, government, health and safety are the norm for Millennials. These significant, life-changing traumas have forced a survivor's mindset centered on strategic thinking and systemic changes. Instead of accepting the status quo, Millennials have learned to innovate quickly, organize robust networks for political and economic gain, rewrite the rules and prepare for the unseen and the worst. They aren't part of a generation that believes Wall Street is too ""Too Big to Fail."" They've seen it repeatedly fail with Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and Wells Fargo, where millions of fraudulently opened bank accounts have harmed customers’ credit. Now, Millennials are infiltrating the system for their gains. For Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it is about holding the titans of business accountable, as she did when she authored the Loan Shark Prevention Act—a bill would establish a 15% cap on interest rates for all loans. Or the utilization of social media, as demonstrated in the increased valuation in cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Ethereum, or last fall's push to end the short sale of Game Stock and AMC Movie Theatre via the power of the network. For Brittany Willis, a Dallas, Texas-based Millennial entrepreneur who recently decided to open up a P.J.’s Coffee of New Orleans franchise in North Dallas during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is about starting something new. “When I saw the long lines at a national competitor and I reviewed their volume metrics, I knew it was possible,” she says. “Now, my coffee shop is booming, and my drive-thru has long lines.” “As I was making my ascent up the corporate ladder, I felt that something was lacking,” adds Willis. “The rungs on the ladder for our generation are broken, and getting to the top of corporate America, as a Millennial Black woman isn’t always accessible. So I decided to build my own ladder based on autonomy and focused on building generational wealth for my family and community.” This isn't a generation that bought into the American dream, sold to their parents and grandparents, that if they went to college and worked hard enough, everything would work out. Many Millennials are still struggling under the triple whammy of crippling student loan debt, living at home with mom and dad and underemployment. Pew Research says 64% percent of Millennials believe the government should solve many of the American people's problems, including economic inequity, climate change and the broken healthcare system. Millennials have experienced more in a quarter century than other generations faced in their lifetimes. “We are a generation of fighters and creators dedicated to the collective,” says Jones. “Our lived experience, the Internet, and our nation's warped politics demonstrate that we don't have to ask permission—there is enough for everyone, and then some.” I am a media commentator, radio host, and millennial messaging expert who currently serves as a progressive contributor at FOX News Channel.

She made her call on the weekend at the second summit of the “Christchurch Call” for action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online. The first Christchurch Call summit was convened by Ardern and French president Emmanuel Macron in May 2019. It took place two months after New Zealand’s first and worst mass shooting in decades, the Christchurch mosque shootings, in which a 28-year-old Australian gunman killed 51 men, women and children. The Christchurch Call is a voluntary compact between governments and technology companies. So far 55 nations have signed on – with the most notable new signatory being the United States, which refused to join under Donald Trump. Google (which owns YouTube), Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Amazon have also signed on, as well as Japanese messaging app LINE, French search engine Qwant and video-sharing sites Daily Motion and JeuxVideo. In light of clear examples of extremist behaviour still being fomented online – the storming of the US Capitol in January being a case in point – one might question how much has been achieved. Read more:
      Two years on from the Christchurch terror attack, how much has really changed? On the weekend Arden, while noting the progress made in areas such as the platforms’ protocols for moderating and removing extremist content, singled out the need for ethical algorithms. Here’s why. Imagine a large, vast restaurant. Service here works in an interesting way. The waiters dash around the restaurant to bring diners as much food as they can eat. They don’t take orders but effectively direct you to what you will eat by putting that food in front of you. The restaurant owner has designed it this way, to keep you eating as much as possible. How do the waiters know what you like? They have a record of what you ate last time. They listen in on your table conversation. You mention you feel like French fries? They will bring you buckets of fries over and over. At first you think: “Isn’t this wonderful, these waiters know just what I like.” But the waiters don’t care about what you like. They just want you to keep eating. Even if the food is unhealthy and increases your risk of disease or death. No matter. They’ll keep bringing it as long as you keep eating. If these waiters were ethical, if they cared about your well-being, they might bring you healthy alternatives. They might put a salad before you. If the restaurant owner was ethical, the service would not be designed to encourage overeating. It would seek to interest you in something else. But then you might stop eating. You might leave the restaurant. That would hurt profits. Social media algorithms work the same as the service in our metaphorical restaurant. Algorithms are tech companies’ secret recipes to keep users on their platforms. The easiest way to do that is serve you content you like – perhaps with even more salt, sugar and fat. On YouTube it’s more of the same type of content you’ve been watching. Like videos of stray dogs being rescued? You’ll get more of those recommended to you. If it’s videos about governments hiding alien technology, you’ll get more of those. Facebook works a little bit differently. It will recommend groups for you to join based on your interests. If you’ve joined a group about native birds, or ascending to the fifth dimension, more such groups will be recommended to you. Those groups enable you to interact with and make “friends’ with others who share your interests and beliefs. Read more:
      Why Facebook created its own ‘supreme court’ for judging content – 6 questions answered These strategies reinforce and normalise our interests and views. They are crucial reasons for the viral-like spread of extremism. An idea, no matter how absurd or extreme, becomes more acceptable
if repeated over and over again. Advertisers know this. So do propagandists. The more we view videos and posts pushing the same ideas, and connect with people who share the same views, the more we feel we’re normal and it’s those who disagree with us who are deluded. This radicalisation is a social phenomenon. It is also a business. Those pushing or holding radical ideas often think they are opposing Big Tech and other corporate interests. They couldn’t be more wrong. Extremist content is a lucrative market segment. Keeping your eyes on a page, enthralling you and  reinforcing your views is a way for content creators, social influencers and the platforms themselves to make bank, boost their ego and spread their message. Which, in turn, legitimises their message. Remember the fundamental business model: for Big Tech it is about about selling your attention to advertisers, no matter the message. Read more:
      Reddit removes millions of pro-Trump posts. But advertisers, not values, rule the day Arden’s call is for algorithms designed with intent – the intent to reduce the promotion of content which can harm you, kill you or – given the right conditions – someone else. An ethical algorithm  would encourage a more balanced diet, even if it meant you would stop consuming. Limiting what the waiters can serve you doesn’t completely avoid the need for important discussions. For example, then who should decide what healthy means? But this would be a less contentious, more productive debate than a stale argument about free expression versus censorship. Especially when the real discussion is the promotion and convenience of ""junk” thinking. Limiting consumption by making things harder to find, not delivered on a platter, is preferable to any outright ban. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

370,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/us/politics/israel-gaza-democrats-biden.html,"Advertisement Supported by Among Democrats in Congress, attitudes toward Israel have grown more critical as the party base expresses concern about the human rights of Palestinians. By Nicholas Fandos and Catie Edmondson WASHINGTON — President Biden’s carefully worded statement on Monday supporting a cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians came amid growing pressure within his own party for the United States to take a more skeptical stance toward one of its closest allies. Mr. Biden’s urging of a halt to the fighting — tucked at the end of a summary of a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — followed a drumbeat of calls from Democratic lawmakers across the ideological spectrum for his administration to speak out firmly against the escalation of violence. It reflected a different tone than the one members of Congress have sounded during past clashes in the region, when most Democrats have repeated their strong backing for Israel’s right to defend itself and called for peace, without openly criticizing its actions. The push is strongest from the energized progressive wing of the party, whose representatives in the House, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have drawn attention in recent days for accusing Israel of gross human rights violations against Palestinians and of operating an “apartheid state.” But their intensity has obscured a quieter, concerted shift among more mainstream Democrats that could ultimately be more consequential. Though they have no intention of ending the United States’ close alliance with Israel, a growing number of Democrats in Washington say they are no longer willing to give the country a pass for its harsh treatment of the Palestinians and the spasms of violence that have defined the conflict for years. Underscoring how skepticism around the campaign in Gaza had spread to even some of Israel’s strongest defenders in Congress, Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, told Democrats on the panel on Monday that he would ask the Biden administration to delay a $735 million tranche of precision-guided weapons to Israel that had been approved before tensions in the Middle East boiled over. Mr. Meeks, a fixture at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the most powerful pro-Israel lobbying group, convened an emergency meeting of Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats on Monday night to discuss delaying the arms package, according to a person familiar with the meeting who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal discussions. It came after a number of Democrats raised concerns about sending American-made weapons to Israel at a time when it has bombed civilians, as well as a building that housed press outlets included The Associated Press, an American news agency. A day earlier, 28 Democratic senators — more than half of the party’s caucus — put out a letter publicly calling for a cease-fire. The effort was led by Senator Jon Ossoff, Democrat of Georgia and, at 34, the face of a younger generation of American Jews in Congress. As Republicans pumped out statements squarely blaming Hamas militants, the Democrats’ appeal put the onus on both sides to lay down their weapons — and on Mr. Biden to weigh in to demand it. Another sign of the evolution came over the weekend from Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Menendez is known as one of Israel’s most unshakable allies in the Democratic Party, which he bucked to oppose President Barack Obama’s 2015 nuclear deal with Iran based on Israeli opposition. Yet on Saturday, as the death toll mounted in Gaza and southern Israel, Mr. Menendez issued a stern statement saying he was “deeply troubled” by Israeli strikes that had killed Palestinian civilians and the tower housing news media outlets. He demanded that both sides “uphold the rules and laws of war” and find a peaceful end to fighting that has killed more than 200 Palestinians and 10 Israelis. Maps show the extent of the fighting that has killed more than 200 people, the vast majority in the Gaza Strip. “In response to thousands of rocket attacks fired by Hamas aimed at civilians, Israel has every right to self-defense from terrorists committed to wipe her off the face of the map,” Mr. Menendez said. “But no matter how dangerous and real that threat may be, I have always believed the strength of the U.S.-Israeli relationship flourishes when it is based on the shared values of democracy, freedom, pluralism, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.” The Democrats who had been most vocal in their criticism of the Israeli government said they meant to send a message to the president as he mulled how to manage the escalating tensions: that the old playbook Mr. Biden used as a senator and as vice president would no longer find the same support in his party. “That hasn’t worked,” Representative Mark Pocan, a progressive Democrat from Wisconsin, told a top adviser to Mr. Biden late last week, he said in an interview on Monday. “We’re going to be advocating for peace in a way that maybe they haven’t traditionally heard.” Republicans and AIPAC have been swift to warn against any perceived weakening of the United States commitment to Israel. When Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who represents the most Jewish district in the country, led a group of 12 Jewish House Democrats in a letter on Friday that stood by Israel but also said Palestinians “should know that the American people value their lives as we do Israeli lives,” AIPAC quietly worked behind the scenes to discourage lawmakers from signing. Republicans have also seen a political advantage in trying to use the most extreme statements from progressive Democrats to try to peel Jewish voters away from the party. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader and a vocal supporter of Israel, condemned Ms. Ocasio-Cortez on Monday for her description of Israel as an “apartheid state” and urged the president to “leave no doubt where America stands.” “The United States needs to stand foursquare behind our ally,” Mr. McConnell said, “and President Biden must remain strong against the growing voices within his own party that create false equivalence between terrorist aggressors and a responsible state defending itself.” Few Democrats in Congress have gone that far. But over the past few years, many in the party have modified their approach. Much of the shift can be traced to debate over the Iran nuclear deal, when Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s right-wing leader, made a concerted effort to insert himself in American domestic politics to kill the pact being drafted by Mr. Obama. He portrayed support for the deal as a betrayal of Israel and worked to drive a wedge between Republicans and Democrats on the issue. Mr. Netanyahu’s close alliance with Mr. Obama’s successor, Donald J. Trump, only deepened that partisan divide. But the difference in tone also reflects a broader shift among the Democratic Party over the past decade. As Democratic voters and liberals have become more self-consciously organized around concepts like equity and systemic discrimination, their push for more liberal policy positions on immigration, policing and gun violence at home has reshaped the way many view the conflict in the Middle East and the violence it has produced. Reflexive support for Israel’s right to defend itself or calls for Israel and Palestinian authorities to return to the negotiating table are now viewed by many on the left as “the linguistic equivalent of ‘our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of the latest mass shooting,’” said Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group that has worked for years to shift the debate as a counterweight to AIPAC. “That’s no longer good enough,” he said in an interview. “What the United States is doing essentially amounts to international immunity to Israel.”  The dynamic was on display last week after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez pounced on Andrew Yang, the leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, for issuing a statement last week “standing with the people of Israel.” “Utterly shameful for Yang to try to show up to an Eid event after sending out a chest-thumping statement of support for a strike killing 9 children,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. (Mr. Yang later released a new statement saying that his first was “overly simplistic” and “failed to acknowledge the pain and suffering on both sides.”) That has left some of Israel’s most vocal traditional allies in the party in an awkward position. Mindful of the crosscurrents in his party and home state, where he faces re-election next year, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, has been largely silent since the fighting broke out. Like Mr. Menendez, Mr. Schumer voted against the Iran nuclear deal, and he represents the largest Jewish population in the country, ranging from secular progressives to politically conservative Orthodox communities. In response to a question asked by a reporter at the Capitol on Monday, Mr. Schumer said, “I want to see a cease-fire reached quickly, and mourn the loss of life.” Advertisement",2021-05-17 20:57:26,"Democrats, Growing More Skeptical of Israel, Pressure Biden","politics and government,united states politics and government,united states international relations,international relations,palestinians,freedom and human rights",1,http://nytimes.com
371,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/17/san-clemente-councilman-proposes-declaration-as-2nd-amendment-sanctuary-city/,"Trending: A San Clemente City Councilman wants his city to be the first in Orange County to declare itself a Second Amendment Sanctuary City. “We’re just saying we support your right to possess and bear arms,” Councilman Gene James said of the proposed resolution he is bringing up for discussion during the council’s Tuesday, May 18, meeting. “We’re not talking about open carry or concealed carry.” James said he was prompted to initiate the discussion because of his “overriding concern about the citizens of San Clemente having the right to be safe and secure in their homes.” His proposed resolution recognizing the Second Amendment as a right is nonbinding, meaning it would be symbolic versus creating a law in San Clemente. “When you look around the state of California, no doubt there is a movement to deprive us of our Second Amendment right,” James said. “We’re limited to 52 handguns when there are thousands made. There is no rhyme or reason for this. It’s almost impossible to buy ammunition because people are so freaked out about buying handguns.” In 2019, the small town of Needles in San Bernadino County passed a similar resolution. City officials said they did it to emphasize their rights, but also because it’s illegal for California residents to cross state lines to purchase ammunition and to get an exemption from state law for out-of-state gun owners who might pass through their town. The closest in-state shops at the time for Needles residents to purchase ammunition were 100 miles away in Blythe or more than 140 miles away in Barstow. But, there were stores 20 minutes away in Arizona. While Needles was going through consideration of its sanctuary status, representatives with the Brady Campaign & Center to Prevent Gun Violence called going in that direction “dangerous” and said gun laws are needed to control the next mass shooting. James said he worries President Joe Biden is looking to outlaw some firearms by executive order. In early April, Biden announced a half-dozen executive actions to combat what he called an “epidemic and an international embarrassment” of gun violence in America. He included banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. “We probably have 15,000 gun owners owning somewhere around 20,000 firearms,” James said of San Clemente. “I want to protect their rights.” His proposal has come up at council meetings before, but he tabled it twice. Once, to answer emails he received criticizing his efforts and a second time when Councilman Steve Knoblock was absent. James said he is hopeful the council will move forward with his proposal to declare San Clemente the first city to take this position in Orange County. “We’re a leader,” he said of the beach city. “Once we pass the resolution, I’ll reach out to other cities in the area.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

372,https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2021/05/17/boston-mayors-race-updates/,"By Christopher Gavin, Nik DeCosta-Klipa, and Dialynn Dwyer The election to choose the next mayor of Boston will take place Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2021, following a preliminary election on Tuesday, Sept. 14. Declared candidates: Read updates from after June 16, 2021, here. Updates below: Two of the candidates to be Boston’s next mayor are speaking out in opposition to a proposal in front of the city’s School Committee to replace the current admissions process for exam school — based on grades and test scores — with a lottery system. City Councilor Annissa Essabi George and state Rep. Jon Santiago told The Boston Globe that they oppose making admission into the three elite high schools — Boston Latin Academy, Boston Latin School, and the John D. O’Bryant School of Math & Science — a matter of “chance.” The lottery system is being considered by the School Committee as part of an effort to give disadvantaged students a better shot against well-heeled families that can pay for things like private tutors and test preparation to help their children. And while Essaibi George and Santiago expressed support for those goals, they said the city should stick with the exams process. “While we certainly need to address diversity in our exam schools, our current school assignment process is concrete evidence that a lottery-based system to access a high quality school does a disservice to our kids and doesn’t improve diversity or the growing opportunity and achievement gap for students of color,” Essaibi George said. Santiago expressed particularly strong disapproval. “Exam schools are based on meritocracy — not chance,” he said. “It is deeply problematic if Black and Latino students have to depend on a lottery ball for a chance at success. This is simply another distraction from the fact that BPS is failing too many students, especially those of color, who deserve a real opportunity — not luck — to attend an exam school.” According to the Globe, the four other candidates in the race, including Acting Mayor Kim Janey, did not immediately take a stance on the proposal. The potential lottery system is among several ideas being proposed to the full School Committee during a meeting Wednesday by a task force formed to look at how to make the Boston’s exam schools more reflective of the city’s “racial, socioeconomic, and geographic diversity,’” while also maintaining their rigor. The effort comes after the School Committee temporarily dropped admissions tests for exam schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, in favor of a process that used grades and zip codes — and ultimately increased the diversity of accepted applicants.During a mayoral forum last month, only Janey and City Councilor Michelle Wu said they favored maintaining a similar plan going forward (though Wu says she’d keep an exam more “aligned with the BPS curriculum” and use more granular geographic data). Annissa Essaibi George has picked up another endorsement from a union representing Boston’s first responders. The Boston Emergency Medical Services union endorsed the city councilor at-large in the mayoral race on Monday, according to her campaign. “The EMTs, Paramedics, Lieutenants and Captains of Boston EMS are proud to stand with Annissa Essaibi George for Mayor of Boston,” Michael MacNeil, president of the EMS Division of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association, said in a statement. “She consistently demonstrates her commitment to our members and the safety of this city. She always checks in — on good days and bad. We need a leader that uplifts and utilizes our talented and dedicated workers and Annissa does, and will continue to do, just that. Boston’s first responders and their families would be lucky to have her as their mayor.” Last month, Essaibi George notched endorsements from both the Boston firefighters union and former police commissioner William Gross. She has also been endorsed by the Massachusetts Nurses Association and the  American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 93, which represents 1,700 of the city’s professional and technical employees. “No question, our city is home to a world-class EMS team,” Essaibi George said in a statement. “They are always there when we need them — bravely providing care in the scariest and most vulnerable moments in our lives. This past year and a half has been especially hard for those on the frontlines fighting this pandemic. I want them to know that they are seen and heard and always will be throughout an Essaibi George Administration. I’m honored and grateful to have their support.” The union representing City of Boston employees and the country’s oldest environmental advocacy group are weighing in on the Boston mayor’s race. In separate announcements Thursday morning, the local leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees endorsed City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George in the race, while the Massachusetts chapter of the Sierra Club backed fellow City Councilor Michelle Wu. “AFSCME Council 93 is thrilled to back Annissa Essaibi George for Mayor of Boston,” said Christopher “Tiger” Stockbridge, the co-chair of AFSCME Boston Presidents’ Committee and president of Local 1631, which represents the city’s professional and technical employees. From school cafeteria workers to parks employees to librarians, AFSCME Council 93 has more than 1,700 members across 17 different departments and agencies, according to Essaibi George’s campaign. “As an organization whose membership is made up of those doing critical work for the City of Boston, we know how important it is to elect a mayor who has our backs—and Annissa is and will be that leader,” Stockbridge said. Meanwhile, during a press conference late Thursday morning, local Sierra Club members vigorously endorsed Wu in the race. “Not only do we examine a candidate’s platform, we investigate if the candidate is walking the talk that they’re talking,” said Rev. Vernon Walker, the chair of the Sierra Club’s state political committee, citing Wu’s work to promote climate change-resilient development and green infrastructure. Walker also cited Wu’s proposed Green New Deal for Boston, which he called an “ambitious policy roadmap for delivering the kinds of structural changes needed to provide a future for sustainable energy, good jobs, and healthy connected communities.” “She meets and exceeds our highest standards of climate and environmental justice,” Walker said. Boston convenience store owners want an audience with the city’s six mayoral candidates to talk about the impacts of the state ban of menthol cigarettes. The first-in-the-nation law that took hold last year removed the popular cigarettes and flavored tobacco from shelves of retailers — products youth anti-tobacco advocates argued tobacco corporations use to entice children and teens. But retailers have vocally opposed the move, and argue the law is similar to the government’s war on drugs that disproportionately impacted communties of color, the State House News Service reports. Customers are now buying menthol cigarettes over the state line, from the black market, or are using other tobacco products instead, store owners say. “Nobody has stopped smoking,” wrote Humayun Morshed, secretary of the Boston Convenience Store Owners Association. “Now, kids have widely available access to menthol on the unregulated streets. And, the state has lost upwards of $140 million in tax and excise revenue — money that could be dedicated to tangibly improve higher priority public health issues in our communities which have been historically underserved.” The association plans to reach out to each candidate to discuss the matter, according to the News Service. “This seems like a good time for you, as candidates seeking to serve the City of Boston to see through the myths, misinformation, half-truths, and white lies perpetuated by anti-tobacco crusaders,” Morshed wrote. “We hope and expect that the new Mayor will have the courage to do something real to help our businesses and our communities.” Every candidate in the Boston mayoral race agreed that recently appointed Police Commissioner Dennis White could no longer lead the department following the resurfacing of decades-old domestic violence allegations. There’s less consensus on what happens next. Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced Monday afternoon that she had fired White and plans to launch a nationwide search for his replacement “to be named toward the end of the year.” However, Janey’s five rivals in the race for a full term say White’s replacement should wait until the city has an elected mayor in November (as City Council president, Janey became acting mayor after Marty Walsh stepped down to become President Joe Biden’s labor secretary). Under Boston’s city charter, acting mayors can only make temporary appointments. Still, the prospect of Janey making a potentially splashy announcement in the midst of a heated race this fall irked several candidates. “A national search for police commissioner without an elected mayor is a charade,” City Councilor Michelle Wu said in a statement Monday evening, adding that Janey’s administration “should not use City resources on a search before the general election.” City Councilor Andrea Campbell blamed “this drawn-out legal battle between the former commissioner and the City,” in addition to the multiple scandals engulfing the Boston Police Department, for eroding “trust” in the city’s police force. “For us to truly transform our police department with new standards of accountability and transparency and build trust, the Acting Commissioner must continue to lead our police department until the next elected mayor can conduct a rigorous and transparent search for a permanent commissioner to ensure the department can serve the diverse needs of our community,” Campbell said. City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George, former Boston economic development chief John Barros, and state Rep. Jon Santiago also think White’s replacement should wait until the city has an elected mayor, according to their campaigns. Boston Police Superintendent-in-chief Greg Long has been serving as acting commissioner since White was first suspended days after his initial appointment in February. Asked about the pressure from the rest of the field of mayoral candidates, Janey’s office said that she will “make a decision regarding interim leadership of the Boston Police Department in the coming weeks, including plans for a national search for a permanent replacement near the end of the year.” The exact timing of the search in relation to the election remains somewhat unclear, though Janey said during her press conference that her administration will begin a community engagement process on the future of police leadership in the “coming weeks.” Aside from the disagreements over the replacement process, most candidates agreed with Janey’s move to fire White. Santiago said he was glad to be “finally moving beyond the chaos” and called Monday “a win for the city.” “Now we must begin to rebuild public trust,” he said. “Those in our Boston Police Department and city institutions must be held to the highest standard,” Essaibi George said. “Dennis White would not be a part of an Essaibi George Administration and I support his removal as Commissioner.” Campbell, who has been critical of Janey’s handling of White’s termination, said the saga was emblematic of the need for deeper police reforms. “This has always been bigger than the Administration’s failure to properly vet a candidate to lead our police department, but about the systemic lack of accountability and transparency in BPD,” she said. A super PAC is wading into the 2021 Boston mayoral race for the first time with ads highlighting City Councilor Andrea Campbell’s unyielding advocacy for police reform. However, the people behind the group also have another shared cause: Charter schools. As The Boston Globe reported Thursday, the top donors to the political action committee, Better Boston, include a number of deep-pocketed charter school proponents, including Boston native and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. According to the Globe, Better Boston aims to raise $2 million. Campbell is one of two candidates in the six-person mayoral race, along with John Barros, who does not oppose the potential expansion of charter schools in Boston (though they’re capped at the state level). In a recent candidate questionnaire, the Mattapan city councilor noted that the opportunities for students in some Boston neighborhoods to attend a high-quality public school were limited. “As Mayor, I will fight for every student to have access to an excellent BPS education,” she wrote. “However, the reality is some families, including in Mattapan, where I am raising my two boys, only have a 5% chance of getting into a high-quality BPS school compared to downtown families who have an 80% chance.” Campbell, who supported the 2016 ballot question to lift the cap on charter schools in Massachusetts, added that it “can be painful for parents” to explore options like METCO, charters, or private school scholarships for low-income families. Better Boston’s website describes itself as “a broad coalition of individuals across sectors who are committed to the Councilor’s bold vision and creating a more inclusive, equitable Boston.” Hastings, a prolific Democratic donor and charter school supporter, also donated $12,000 to an effort in 2009 to expand charter schools in his home state of Massachusetts.  According to the Globe, the group’s top donors also include several other prominent Massachusetts-based charter school supporters. Better Boston, which is legally prohibited from coordinating with any campaigns, first filed with state officials in March. Campbell’s campaign manager, Katie Prisco-Buxbaum, said Thursday that they have no involvement with Better Boston and “continue to be focused on growing our campaign with grassroots donations by people across this city who are passionate about building a more equitable Boston.” Prisco-Buxbaum also noted that Campbell, a Boston Latin alum, has really in-depth policy visions for making the Boston Public School system more equitable. “Andrea is a proud BPS graduate who knows firsthand how deeply inequitable that system is which is why her focus has always been on improving Boston Public Schools and she has released comprehensive plans to ensure every child in Boston has access to a quality Boston Public education,” she said in a statement. Boston Pride is postponing a mayoral forum that was planned for this coming Monday until June 14 after several candidates withdrew to participate in a simultaneous event staged by LGBTQ activists who have pushed for a boycott of the organization. Following conversations with LGBT residents, city councilors Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, and Michell Wu said Tuesday that they were pulling out of Boston Pride’s virtual forum to attend a separate Zoom event Monday hosted by Mass NOW, Trans Resistance, the Transgender Emergency Fund, and the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition. Their announcements come amid criticism from the coalition of LGBTQ groups that Boston Pride hasn’t been sufficiently inclusive of Black and transgender members. Since last year, the groups have also been pressing Boston Pride, which organizes the city’s largest pride parade, to diversify its board, which has no Black members. “We are holding this forum at the same time as Boston Pride’s forum for the same reason we’re holding the Trans Resistance March on the same day as Boston Pride — to boycott Boston Pride until they transition leadership,” said an invitation to the mayoral candidates, according to The Boston Globe. Campbell, Essaibi George, and Wu subsequently accepted. In a statement, Essaibi George said the “decision is difficult for me because, for decades, Boston Pride has laid the groundwork here locally for so many to follow.” But she added that it was clear that many in the LGBT community, especially those who are trans, Black, indigenous, or people of color, “are not being represented by this organization.” “That needs to be addressed both in the Boston Pride organization itself and the city at large,” Essaibi George said. In a separate statement, Campbell said she looked forward to “joining pride events that value and empower BIPOC queer and trans folx.” On its website, Boston Pride — which has hired a diversity consultant to help “institute transformational change” — said it was pushing its forum back a week “out of respect” for the groups hosting the rival event. “The issues facing the LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC communities are critical to moving the City of Boston forward and by having our Boston Mayoral Candidates Forum at another time, we are giving more space for the candidates to discuss these issues,” their website said. Boston’s public school system is getting a one-time infusion of $400 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to spend over the next three years. Andrea Campbell is proposing to put roughly a third of the money into the hands of BPS families to use for various student supports. In a press release Thursday, the Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate called on the district to provide each BPS student $3,000 for “Student Acceleration Accounts” that could be used to pay for things like tutoring from school staff, homework help, afterschool and summer programs, counseling, and other student supports in the wake of the pandemic. According to Campbell, the menu of options would be available through either a simple web portal or paper form. Schools could customize which supports they offer, and teachers would provide input to families on each student’s needs. “As a mother, I know this pandemic has taken a huge toll on our children, and that parents know best what supports their children need to make up for the tremendous learning disruption over the past year,” Campbell said, noting that the $400 million in relief funds breaks down to over $9,000 per student. BPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius announced a commission last month to advise how to best spend the new federal money. The group is scheduled to present a plan at its final meeting on July 1. Campbell is calling for her proposed student acceleration accounts, which she also dubbed “BPS Bucks,” to be part of that final plan. “Of course there will be a role for centrally-run programs as well, but we also need to trust the adults closest to our students to know what’s best for each child,” she said. John Barros became the latest Boston mayoral candidate to release a plan for “Mass. and Cass,” as addressing addiction and homelessness in the neighborhood known for being the center of the regional opioid crisis became a point of contention in the six-way race Wednesday. In his three-part plan, Barros said he would immediately appoint a “Special Advisor for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” tasked with assembling a team of social workers and health care workers, as well as three liaisons to the mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Service, to coordinate the provision of services to those struggling. The second part of his plan calls for de-densifying services so that homeless shelters and addiction treatment centers are less concentrated in one single neighborhood. Barros says he would work to set up needle exchange programs in other parts of the city and explore “methadone home delivery systems” so that individuals don’t need to travel to the Mass. and Cass area for methadone treatment. He also said he would urge other cities and towns, where some shelters require ID or proof of local residency, to “do their part” as well as explore how some services currently centered at Mass. and Cass could be broken up and moved elsewhere, either within or outside Boston. Finally, the third part of Barros’s plan calls for reestablishing recovery programs on Long Island, which continues to be ensnared in a legal battle with the City of Quincy. In a statement, Barros said Mass. and Cass is “struggling under the weight of an overly dense concentration of services,” calling on the city to implement his proposal to “strategically deliver quality, yet de-densified health care and services to those in need.” Barros isn’t alone in calling for more dedicated resources and decentralized services; most other candidates in the race have released similar plans. And during a candidate forum earlier Wednesday, he and City Councilor Andrea Campbell pressed Acting Mayor Kim Janey to take more immediate action. “In terms of decentralization, I don’t see any communities raising their hand to say, ‘Hey, we want services and treatment here,’” Janey responded, according to the State House News Service. “So a lot of people can point their fingers, I don’t see anyone raising their hand to say, ‘Yes, we want to embrace people who need support and services.’ We’ve got a lot of work to do.” Janey also argued that a lot of work is already happening, noting that the city is reversing an average of four overdoses a day, as the State House News Service reported. “This notion that nothing is happening, unfortunately, it’s not true,” she said. “I mean, people want to talk about that because people don’t like what they see. And the truth is, this is a very complex issue. People are not magically getting well and getting jobs and getting housing. There is a plan in place.” City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George says she would create a new city department to advocate for workers if elected mayor, as part of a economic justice plan released by her campaign Wednesday. According to the plan, the Department of Economic Justice & Workers’ Rights would include a cabinet-level chief who reports directly to the mayor and evaluates the potential impact that policies might have on Boston’s families. The office would also be tasked with addressing racial discrimination, identifying “problem areas” in Boston, and launching economic initiatives, as well as investigating and penalizing workers’ rights violations. Essaibi George’s plan, which calls out the stunning racial wealth gap in Boston, also says she would create more pathways to home ownership and access to capital for historically underserved communities, in addition to workforce development initiatives like increased investment in Boston’s vocational schools. As mayor, Essaibi George even says she’ll explore direct cash payments as a means of assistance for the city’s more vulnerable residents. The second half of the plan focuses on workers’ rights, pledging to give unions more say in the political process and to create a cabinet-level working group to “solely focus on promoting union organizing.” “For too long, our economy has neglected our hard-working residents, prioritized white wealth building over Black and Latinx, and ignored workplace health and safety,” Essaibi George said in a statement. “Boston has the opportunity and responsibility to learn from our past, and not just rebuild our economy, but build a better economy that works for everyone.” Read the full plan here. Michelle Wu wants a big post-vax summer. The Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate said Tuesday that Boston should close off scores of streets for pedestrians and create a micro-grant program so that “every neighborhood” can host supervised block parties featuring arts, food, music, and children’s activities. “As Boston reopens and recovers, it’s time for a Summer of Play—using arts and culture to heal, connect, and inspire,” Wu said in a statement Tuesday. “Imagine music and community events in every park, block parties in every neighborhood, and every bit of Boston’s diversity reflected in the vibrancy on our open streets.” According to Wu’s campaign, the idea is modeled after Philadelphia’s decades-old Playstreets program, which closes off hundreds of small, one-way streets to traffic to provide children safe places to play during the summer. During a press conference Tuesday, Wu said that Boston should follow suit by easing the permitting process and providing funding for neighborhood events. She also touted the community-building effects of block parties in a 2019 opinion piece in The Boston Globe. “We should move from having a culture of ‘Prove that you can do this’ to a default of ‘Yes, let’s find a way to make this happen that is safe and engaging,'” Wu said Tuesday. In addition to open streets and parks, Wu also said the city should look to use public spaces like schools, community centers, libraries, and churches as performance venues. Wu was joined Tuesday by WBUR radio announcer José Massó, who voiced support for the initiative as a “segue from what has been the last 15 months” during the COVID-19 pandemic to a “total embrace of arts and culture” in the coming years. State Rep. Jon Santiago’s bid to lead City Hall notched support Tuesday from Beacon Hill’s top legislators. During a press conference in the South End, Massachusetts House Speaker Ron Mariano, Majority Leader Claire Cronin, and more than a dozen other state representatives endorsed Santiago in the Boston mayor’s race, adding to a growing list of State House colleagues who have rallied behind the second-term Democrat. Mariano, a Quincy Democrat, noted that he’s “seen a lot of people come in” during his 30 years at the State House. “One of the things that constantly amazed me about Jon Santiago was the diversity of his talents, his work ethic, and his ability to understand how to get things done in the body of 160 people,” Mariano said, adding that Santiago “understands how to compromise.” He also marveled at how Santiago continued to work as an emergency room doctor at Boston Medical Center and serve in the U.S. Army Reserves since his election in 2019. “Jon has the unique talents to take this city by the neck and lift it, because he’s a worker,” Mariano said. Cronin, an Easton resident, said that Santiago had “been on the front lines” of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and had a “very significant role” in passing legislation on police reform and reproductive rights. Santiago has also been endorsed by a handful of members of Boston’s State House delegation, including North End Rep. Aaron Michlewitz. Asked how the new endorsements from outside the city help his campaign, Santiago said that he thinks “support from anywhere from every corner of the commonwealth is important.” “It’s important that the mayor of Boston have strong relationships with Legislature,” he said. Even though Santiago joined the State House less than two years ago, Mariano said he was “so happy” about his decision to run for mayor. “Even if he loses, the worst thing that happens is he comes back to me,” Mariano said. “And I get to use his talents. And we will use his talents. But the city of Boston should know about these talents.” The union representing Boston’s firefighters is backing Annissa Essaibi George in the race to be the city’s next mayor, citing the city councilor’s “unwavering support for Boston’s first responders.” “From showing up at our firehouses with coffee, to picking up the phone to check in on our brave men and women, to advocating for investments in our health and safety, she has our backs and we have unanimously voted to have hers in this race,” Boston Fire Lieutenant John Soares, the president of Local 718, said in a statement. “As a little girl, my family home caught on fire, but we all made it out safely thanks to Boston’s brave firefighters,” Essaibi George said. “It’s no surprise that I hold a special place in my heart for them. Their sacrifices and bravery keep our city and its residents safe. I’m honored to have their support.” The endorsement comes after former Boston police commissioner William Gross backed Essaibi George earlier this month. The Dorchester native, known as one of the more moderate candidates in the race, has also been endorsed by the Massachusetts Nurses Association. Local 718 says it represents 1,500 active men and women firefighters, though the vast majority are men. The Boston Fire Department has also faced pressure to diversify its membership, which is nearly three-quarters white, in a city that is mostly people of color. During a press conference Monday morning outside Florian Hall, Essaibi George reportedly agreed that the department has work to do. According to The Boston Globe, she said Boston needs to do “a much better job diversifying the firefighting force,” starting with the department’s cadet program. “That work certainly starts with recruiting, especially from our city’s kids,” Essaibi George said. “We need to make sure that the kids of Boston see themselves reflected in the Boston Fire Department.” The impacts of the opioid epidemic on the area of the city known as “Mass and Cass” garnered new attention in the mayoral race this week. On Wednesday, City Councilor Andrea Campbell issued a direct challenge to Acting Mayor Kim Janey, calling on her fellow candidate to release an action plan for the area within 30 days. “We have incredible service providers doing heroic work in the area alongside city departments, yet they are overwhelmed and siloed,” Campbell said in a statement. “We need a coordinated effort and response to increase our collective impact, and it is critical our city and state administrations take the lead in building that partnership. I’m calling on the Administration including Acting Mayor Janey to meet with advocates and leaders on the front lines of this issue, and publicly release an action plan by June 19th.” The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the impacts of the opioid crisis in the city over the last year. But the crisis is the area surrounding Mass. Ave. and Melnea Cass Boulevard, where shelters and services offer support to those dealing with addiction and homelessness, is not new. Residents of the adjacent South End and Roxbury neighborhoods have been expressing concern and alarm about worsening conditions — including improperly discarded needles and individuals overdosing in alleys — in the area for years. But in recent years, community members have seen more people navigating substance use disorder, mental health issues, and homelessness arriving in the area to seek help from service providers clustered around the stretch of city blocks known disparagingly for years as “Methadone Mile.” Campbell, who has released her own plan for Mass. and Cass, is calling on Janey to implement steps from her own roadmap to address the crisis by creating and appointing a “Mass. and Cass Chief,” establishing a dedicated first responder unit for the area, finalizing a plan to decentralize services, and taking steps toward reopening a recovery campus on Long Island in Boston Harbor. Read our plan: https://t.co/05McUQfPWZ A day after Campbell issued the challenge to Janey, mayoral candidate and state Rep. Jon Santiago announced his own plan for addressing the crisis. During a press conference Thursday, the Boston Medical Center emergency room doctor and South End resident called the situation around Mass. and Cass a “full-blown crisis.” “We are in desperate need of leadership,” Santiago said. “We need a bold plan, and a tremendous amount of urgency. But most of all, we need action. And a commitment to get things done at Mass and Cass and for the many people suffering from addiction all across Boston. Because this summer will no doubt prove to be the most difficult for Mass and Cass. And while last year was very challenging, this year, given the improving weather, the release from social isolation, the rising rates of mental health illness and drug use, I fear for the worst.” The state representative said under his plan for addressing the nexus of substance use, mental health illness, and homelessness, he will “immediately” declare a public health emergency for the area, appoint a “Mass and Cass Director of Services,” and focus on decentralizing, regionalizing, and modernizing services for substance use and homelessness. Those efforts would kick off with an immediate moratorium on new public services within a one-mile radius of Mass. and Cass, with Santiago promising to build a “world class and accessible” recovery campus on Long Island, expanding supportive housing opportunities elsewhere in the city, and establishing a Regional Municipal Task Force to focus in partnership with other municipalities on a regional approach to issues related to substance use and homelessness. “If decentralization and scaling up supportive housing are core tenets in how we begin to address Mass and Cass, regionalization is also paramount,” he said. “This is of utmost importance as over half of Boston’s shelter population comes from outside the city.” Right now, the politician and doctor said leadership on the issue of Mass. and Cass is “nowhere to be found” even as the crisis worsens. “Our businesses need help,” Santiago said. “And those suffering on Mass and Cass need a mayor who has their back and who’s going to fight for them everyday like I do in the ER. And I look forward to leading the charge when elected mayor.” We need action. We need a commitment to get things done at Mass and Cass and for the many people suffering from addiction all across Boston. Read our plan below: https://t.co/Ixwogy8enF Two Boston mayoral candidates are getting support from some big names this week. U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, is joining City Councilor Michelle Wu at a virtual fundraiser at 6 p.m. Wednesday for the latter’s mayoral campaign. The event is billed as a conversation between the two politicians. “Senator Duckworth is a veteran and fearless voice for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community — and we’re thrilled to have her joining Michelle and our team for this virtual event,” Wu’s campaign wrote in an email to supporters Tuesday. Tickets start at $5 at the “guest” level and reach $500 and $1,000 for the “champion” and “maximum” levels, respectively. The event webpage also notes all of Wu’s events are “open to everyone, regardless of ability to pay.” Those who cannot contribute but would like to attend are asked to email the campaign, “no questions asked,” the page says. Meanwhile, actress and producer Ellen Pompeo, of “Grey’s Anatomy,” is joining acting Mayor Kim Janey at 7 p.m. Wednesday for a virtual “birthday celebration.” Janey turned 56 years old on Sunday. “Mayor Janey and Ellen plan on having some fun swapping stories about growing up in Roxbury and Everett,” Janey’s campaign wrote in a recent email to its supporters. “They will also talk about how Mayor Janey is tackling today’s biggest issues in Boston.“ Tickets begin at $56 and ascend to $500 and $1,000 at the “champion” and “host” levels, respectively. Those top donors will have access to a pre-event reception with Janey and Pompeo. Guests can RSVP by either making a contribution online or emailing the campaign. Boston’s mayoral candidates called for transparency and accountability following acting Mayor Kim Janey’s release of an independent report Friday, detailing decades-old domestic violence allegations against suspended Boston Police Commissioner Dennis White. “Domestic violence is never OK,” City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George told The Boston Globe. “This case speaks to the critical need for greater transparency and accountability in the Boston Police Department and our other city institutions. It is imperative that anyone appointed to high positions must be subjected to a rigorous vetting and thorough background checks. That clearly wasn’t the case here.” White, 59, was placed on leave in February, but was soon suspended after the Globe raised questions over allegations from 1999 that he pushed and threatened to shoot his then-wife. In the report, city-hired attorney Tamsin Kaplan found another assault allegation from 1993, in which a neighbor said they saw White slap his niece-in-law after she kicked him during an argument. White admitted he slapped her although the unidentified woman said it was a punch, according to the report. Both filed assault charges against one another, but the charges were later dismissed. An internal police investigation did not sustain the allegation against White on the basis that his open-handed slap was a “reflexive self-defense response,” according to the report. The report also documented additional abuse allegations around the same time as the 1999 incident. Four witnesses told Kaplan that White mentally and physically abused his wife. White has denied all of those allegations but told Kaplan there was “physical abuse in the relationship,” which he said was limited to pushing, initiated by both he and his wife. State Rep. Jon Santiago told the Globe the allegations detailed are “incredibly disturbing” and “disgusting.” He said a “code of silence” within the Boston Police Department needs to be removed. “[These allegations] represent a troubling pattern of behavior of a man in power against multiple women,” Santiago said. “Survivors of domestic violence deserve better. They deserve decisive action from their leaders.” Janey said Friday she believes the city should have a new commissioner. White has mounted a legal challenge to that, through filing a restraining order and preliminary injunction in Suffolk Superior Court. His attorney has argued Janey, as acting mayor, does not have the authority to fire White and removing any employee requires a hearing and a cause. On Monday, Janey said she hopes the court will make a ruling sometime this week so a hearing can be held. “My intent is to move the police department forward, and ultimately move our city forward,” she said. “There is a lot of work that we have to do in our city, and we can’t have the officers who are doing good work every day, wonder that if they speak up, that somehow there’ll be some retaliation. We saw that there was a clear culture of fear and silence with this report, and we can’t have that continue — nor can we have a culture, by which victims of domestic violence or sexual assault feel like they can’t go to the police for help.” Some of Janey’s fellow mayoral candidates criticized her for her handling of the situation. “Instead of moving forward to tackle the systemic reforms the people of Boston want, Acting Mayor Janey is in a standoff with Dennis White — and it’s not even clear who’s currently leading our police department,” City Councilor Andrea Campbell said in a statement Friday. “The city needs leadership that brings clarity and stability to this situation, not chaos and confusion.” John Barros, the city’s former chief of economic development, said the public should have access to the complete internal affairs records related to the investigation, according to the Globe. “Leadership matters and good management is essential. The residents of Boston and Commissioner White deserve transparency and clear reasoning around the decision to terminate without a hearing,” Barros said. “Trust is rooted in transparency. Any progress around police and public safety reform cannot begin without that foundation.” City Councilor Michelle Wu, in a statement, said: “It’s disappointing for Boston residents to continue to have no clarity about who will steer the Police Department over the next six months as interim commissioner until the next administration. “As Mayor, I will lead a comprehensive, transparent process to fully vet and select a permanent Commissioner to guide the cultural and structural changes that we need across this department,” she said. “But these changes must start right now through the ongoing police union contract negotiations, about which the public has had no information or transparency.” In a sudden course reversal, the City of Boston is dropping its defense of a Boston Police Department promotional exam criticized as racially discriminatory, bringing an end to a years-long legal fight. Following a Boston Globe report Thursday morning on the ongoing court case and criticism from several 2021 mayoral candidates, Acting Mayor Kim Janey’s office said Thursday afternoon that they will seek to settle the lawsuit brought by a group of Black sergeants, who said a previous version of the multiple-choice exam unfairly blocked them from promotions to lieutenant. “Black officers in the Boston Police Department deserve a fair shot at promotions,” Janey said in a statement. “My administration will not waste tax dollars defending past department practices that created barriers to opportunity for people of color,” she continued. “I have directed our legal team to resolve this matter, as we move forward with a new vision for public safety in our city.” Read the full story here. Former Boston Police Commissioner William Gross endorsed City Councilor At-Large Annissa Essaibi George for mayor on Thursday. Gross, the city’s first Black police commissioner who retired from the post earlier this year after a 37-year career, was scheduled to join Essaibi George on a small business tour in Mattapan Thursday afternoon. Over the course of his three decades of service, Commissioner Gross prioritized community engagement, built trust between law enforcement and residents, and promoted diversity and inclusion throughout the Police Department. I’m so grateful to have his support. pic.twitter.com/1JYrlP5W1S Read the full story here. In a contest involving four of their colleagues, the other nine members of the Boston City Council have publicly remained neutral in this year’s Boston mayoral race. But for City Councilor Frank Baker, the stance apparently isn’t a difficult decision. “There’s not a candidate for me,” Baker told the Dorchester Reporter in an article Thursday announcing his own plans to run for a sixth term on the council. A registered Democrat and self-described “extreme centrist,” Baker has earned a reputation for standing apart from — and sometimes clashing with — his colleagues on the increasingly progressive City Council. Still, his comments come as a particularly direct rebuke of mayoral hopefuls and fellow Councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, and Kim Janey, who is now the city’s acting mayor. “It’s a different council, and I have my personal opinions,” Baker, a Dorchester resident who first took office in 2011, told the Reporter this week. Baker added that “some of my colleagues have called me a racist” and claimed fellow city councilors “encouraged their supporters to call me and harass me” over his stances, such as voting against a measure to block evictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baker also indicated that he would not be running for re-election if not for the pandemic. “If Covid didn’t hit, I would have felt like my job got wrapped up” Baker told the Reporter, adding, “But everything is up in the air, and I would feel incomplete.” Local elected officials of color are speaking out in force against the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association, after a dispute between the police union and City Councilor Andrea Campbell took a personal turn this week. Read the full story here. With Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins in the running to be the next U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Richard Taylor reportedly had an idea. CommonWealth magazine reported Thursday that Taylor, the state’s transportation secretary under Gov. Bill Weld and a now prominent Black real estate developer, sent an email this week to supporters of Andrea Campbell’s mayoral campaign arguing that the Boston city councilor should drop out of the race and instead bid to succeed Rollins as district attorney. According to CommonWealth, Taylor argued the move would provide an easier path for Acting Mayor Kim Janey to win a full term this fall by ensuring that the Black vote wouldn’t be split (there are currently three Black candidates in the race: Campbell, Janey, and John Barros). Taylor presented it as a “win-win.” One issue: Campbell is very much not onboard. In a statement, Campbell campaign manager Katie Prisco-Buxbaum noted that the Mattapan city councilor launched her campaign in September when former mayor Marty Walsh was still expected to run for a third term, and said that “for some to imply she, as one of the frontrunners in this race, would be looking at another office now is both misinformed and insulting.” Early polling has shown that a plurality of voters remain undecided. And while Janey has received national attention for becoming the first Black person and first woman to lead Boston, campaign finance data shows that Campbell has raised the most money in the race this year, slightly outpacing fellow city councilor Michelle Wu. There’s also no guarantee that she would notch the district attorney position. If Rollins does get appointed as U.S. attorney, Republican Gov. Charlie Baker would pick her temporary replacement until the seat is up for re-election in 2022. And Campbell has never publicly signaled interest in being Suffolk district attorney. “Andrea has never done anything because it was easy or politically convenient, but because she knows she has the leadership, lived experience, and vision to serve her community and transform our systems to be more equitable and create opportunity for all,” Prisco-Buxbaum said. “She’s running for mayor, and only mayor, to do just that.” The Boston City Council voted Wednesday to heed requests from the city’s election officials and move up the preliminary municipal election one week to Sept 14. The change will give the city’s Election Department more time to print and distribute ballots to vote-by-mail voters following the election but ahead of the Nov. 2 general election, as Eneida Tavares, chair of the Boston Elections Commission, explained to councilors last week. The preliminary election was initially set for Sept. 21. State lawmakers opted last month to expand no-excuse-needed vote-by-mail options through June 30. Tavares said officials anticipate the practice — taken up last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic — could extend through city elections this fall. The possibility became a bit more probable Wednesday: Councilor Ricardo Arroyo filed a home rule petition that, if passed, would make the practice permanent for city elections. Both former Mayor Marty Walsh and Secretary of State William Galvin voiced support for the election date change. The council’s Committee on Government Operations backed the switch as well. No councilors voted in opposition to the change, although mayoral hopeful and City Councilor At-Large Annissa Essaibi George voted “present.” Andrew Yang won’t be the only mayoral candidate campaigning on a basic income program. During a forum Monday night on the audio-based social media app Clubhouse, John Barros pledged to bring a guaranteed income program to Boston, if he is elected mayor this fall. “I am all in on guaranteed income,” Barros said, adding that he had seen “promising results” from pilot programs in other cities, like Stockton, California, as well as smaller emerging initiatives in some neighboring Massachusetts cities. “Frankly, what we’ve seen with the COVID relief money has shown us the fact that it is needed,” Barros said, referring to the federal government’s recent direct cash payments to low- and middle-income residents. “And it is a good way to make sure that people have the basics that they need,” he said. “And it’s a way to make sure that certain people in our economy can continue to do work and not have to do two jobs, three jobs. At certain points, my parents had to do two to three jobs. It’s not fair.” The city’s former economic development chief, Barros said he’s planning to release a guaranteed income plan on his website. However, he suggested that it wouldn’t be a “universal” basic income plan. According to Barros, the program would start out dedicated to “single heads of households,’ targeting single mothers who have struggled particularly hard during the pandemic, in part due to a lack of affordable child care. He pointed at his work with a group called Family Independence Initiative, which provides direct cash assistance to low-income families, as well as opportunities for recipients to talk with each other about how they’re using the money. Barros said he favors a similar pilot for Boston, so that guaranteed income recipients “can make the right kinds of decisions.” “This is not about sustaining people,” he said. “This is not about creating just the basics. This is about positioning people to be more productive in our society.” South Boston state Sen. Nick Collins announced Tuesday he will not enter the race to become Boston’s next chief executive. “After much encouragement and consideration and discussions with my family, I’ve decided I will not be a candidate for mayor,” Collins said in a statement. “I remain dedicated to my job in the Massachusetts Senate and working with leadership and my colleagues on our shared priorities to help Boston and the Commonwealth grow and thrive. I look forward to working closely with City Hall to create a better Boston for all.” Collins, a Democrat, was considered a potential early contender after it became clear earlier this year that now former Mayor Marty Walsh would not seek a third term. Last month, Collins faced some criticism after making a joke ahead of the city’s annual St. Patrick’s Day Breakfast aimed at Michelle Wu that suggested she is not “from Boston.” “What else do @BenAffleck and @wutrain have in common?” Collins wrote on Twitter, commenting on a video Wu posted that parodied viral moments of Affleck struggling to hold his Dunkin’ order. “They both love acting like they’re from Boston!” The remarks came following a mass shooting that left eight people — six of them Asian women — dead in Atlanta and sparked a national dialogue on racism against Asian Americans. Michelle Wu wants to make Boston’s yellow buses a bit more green. During a press conference Thursday afternoon outside one of the city’s bus yards, Wu called for Boston to shift to an all-electric school bus fleet by 2030. “This is not only an urgent and important goal, it is a doable one,” Wu said, stressing the dual public health and environmental benefits. The call comes on the heels of President Joe Biden’s proposal to electrify at least 20 percent of the country’s school buses as part of his infrastructure plan, given the harmful health impacts of air pollution and research showing that children on the diesel-fueled yellow buses face exposure to pollutants between five and 10 times higher than average levels. “We are exposing our children, our bus monitors, our bus drivers to greater health risk, every single day,” Wu said. About half of Boston’s 700 school buses run on diesel, accounting for 60 percent of all diesel fuel consumed by the city government. Wu noted that the city is set to enter a new bus contract negotiation in 2023, which she said must be “a moment to really seize on progress and to take advantage” of potential financing and support made available through Biden’s infrastructure plan. Wu noted that the electrification goal is just one part of her 52-page education plan. Fellow city councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell has also called for electrifying the city’s school bus fleet as part of her transportation plan, though it does not include a target date. Andrea Campbell is calling on acting Mayor Kim Janey to bring in the U.S. attorney’s office to independently investigate the Boston Police Department in regards to the Patrick Rose Sr. case. Rose, a retired police officer and former police union president, is accused of molesting six children. Janey’s administration on Tuesday released 13 pages of a long-sought-after internal affairs investigation file showing a department probe sustained a 1995 allegation Rose molested a 12-year-old child. But Rose eventually returned to full duty after the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association’s attorney wrote a letter threatening to file a grievance over Rose’s restricted duties during the investigation. Campbell is also now calling on Janey to release the full file. “Transparency in the Rose case is what Bostonians deserve but not what we got on Tuesday, when heavily redacted and incomplete internal affairs files were released within twenty minutes of the most anticipated national news of the week — the verdict in Derek Chauvin’s trial for the murder of George Floyd,” the city councilor said in a statement. “There are so many questions left unanswered by the Administration.” Campbell said the administration should seek the U.S. attorney’s office “to conduct a full independent investigation.” “If BPD is refusing to release this information, the people deserve to know,” she said. If BPD is refusing to release information, the people deserve to know. I am calling on Acting Mayor Janey to enlist the U.S. Attorney to conduct a full, independent investigation, and to release the full internal affairs files including facts of the case and disciplinary action. pic.twitter.com/y3k82ztehI City officials have said files were redacted to protect the identity of the victim involved in the allegations. “In releasing a redacted version of former Boston Police Officer Patrick Rose’s internal affairs file today, we seek to provide transparency and accountability around the internal affairs process in 1996, while upholding our legal obligation to protect the identities of victims of sexual violence and our moral responsibility to avoid retraumatizing them,” Janey said in a statement released with the file. “In light of this goal, we are providing as much information to the public as possible about the circumstances surrounding the internal affairs investigation and how leadership at the time responded to the findings.” Janey has tapped Stephanie Everett, the incoming executive director of the newly formed Office of Police Accountability and Transparency, to investigate the process followed in the Rose case. Everett begins the job on May 3 and will have 45 days to “deliver a plan for review and, as necessary, for reform of the police department’s internal affairs procedures,” Janey said. But Campbell is not the only one wanting more information to come to light. In a joint statement Tuesday, Paul Evans, who served as the Boston police commissioner at the time of the first allegation against Rose, and former police Superintendent Ann Marie Doherty also called on the city to release the full file. They said the complete report will show the department did all that it could to try to hold Rose accountable. Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George’s mayoral campaign released a sweeping education reform plan Tuesday, drawing on her lifelong experience with the city’s public school system. “As a former Boston Public Schools (BPS) teacher, a BPS graduate, a mother to four BPS students, and the current Chair of Boston City Council’s Committee on Education, I’ve held a front row seat to the challenges facing our students, families, educators, and public school system day in and day out,” Essaibi George said in a statement. The 22-page plan broadly cites inconsistencies and achievement gaps across the district’s 125 schools and calls for more robust investments in child care and early education — including universal pre-kindergarten, something that former mayor Marty Walsh campaigned on. According to Essaibi George, she would seek to implement universal child care through “Commonwealth and community partnerships, City investment, federal block grants, social impact bonds, private providers and development funds.” Essaibi George says she would also keep entrance exams for Boston’s three exam schools, but work to increase access to the schools, particularly for communities of color. “Taking away the exam schools doesn’t fix the disparities in Boston Public Schools and only delays getting to the real problem,” Essaibi George said during a forum Tuesday night. Her plan pledges to implement citywide literacy programs beginning at the pre-K level, as well as new district-wide curriculum standards that include more robust STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) programs and new standards for ethnic studies, art education, and civics. The plan also proposes reforms to Boston’s School Committee. While some councilors have suggested making the committee an elected body, Essaibi George says its members should still be appointed. However, she would give the City Council, in addition to the mayor, some appointing power. Essaibi George would also add two seats — including a voting student seat — to make it a nine-member committee. Additionally, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Essaibi George called for increasing access to behavioral health and emotional wellness support in schools, including “universal behavioral health screenings” and district-wide staffing rules requiring a full-time psychologist, school counselor, and social worker in every school. “I hope as mayor that I never see this pandemic again,” she said Tuesday night. “But I do know, as mayor, we will be in the midst of — because it’s already started — a mental health pandemic.” Citing the ongoing risks of COVID-19, nearly all the candidates in the Boston mayor’s race are calling on state election officials to ease signature requirements to qualify for the September ballot. In a letter Tuesday to Secretary of State Bill Galvin’s office, as well as the co-chairs of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Election Laws, Sen. Barry Finegold and Rep. Daniel Ryan, five of the six mayoral candidates — as well as five at-large City Council candidates — urged officials to reduce the number of signatures that candidates need to file to qualify for the ballot, permit electronic collection of signatures, or allow the city itself to provide greater flexibility around “ballot access and signature collection requirements.” “Our ability to campaign for office and access the ballot in a manner consistent with public health is currently undermined by state laws requiring us to collect a high number of “in person signatures in order to appear on ballots in the City of Boston,” read the letter, which was signed by John Barros, Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, Kim Janey, and Jon Sanitago. “While this is a statewide issue, we are most acutely burdened by the current laws, given the high number of signatures (3,000 for mayoral candidates, 1,500 for Council candidates) we need to collect to reach the ballot,” the Boston candidates added. One name that was notably absent among the signatories was Michelle Wu, the first candidate to declare their candidacy in the 2021 race. While she voted in favor of a unanimously passed Boston City Council resolution last week that urged Galvin to reduce the number of required signatures and allow electronic collection, Wu told GBH that we “are very far into the campaign season.” “We are exactly one week away from getting the printed signature papers in hand to begin the process of getting on the ballot,” Wu said. “This is five business days for the state Legislature and others to act.” Candidates have until May 18 to file the required number of signatures. Just over a year ago, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court slashed the number of signatures required for candidates for state and federal office by 50 percent, after a number of candidates sued the state, arguing that the pandemic made the traditional face-to-face, door-to-door method of collecting signatures potentially hazardous and unconstitutionally burdensome. That decision, however, came amid slightly different circumstances. At the time, Massachusetts was in the midst of the first COVID-19 surge. But now, infection rates — both in Boston and across the state — are trending downward and hospitalizations are far lower than last spring, as vaccinations progress. Still, the candidates’ letter to Galvin argues that asking campaigns to “engage with large numbers of individuals at close quarters to collect signatures poses a public health risk and increases the likelihood of infection with the deadly virus.” “Last year, your efforts to allow candidates to collect signatures electronically placed the Commonwealth at the forefront of a movement to ensure our democracy remains fair and accessible during a pandemic,” they wrote. “This year, we hope you will continue that legacy.” Boston city councilors are considering shifting the scheduled Sept. 21 municipal preliminary election up one week to give the city’s Election Department more time to handle mail-in ballots. Eneida Tavares, chair of the Boston Elections Commission, told councilors on Tuesday commissioners are seeking to move the election to Sept. 14 in anticipation of vote-by-mail expanding through the fall election cycle. State lawmakers voted last month to extend the practice to all voters through June 30. Should the Legislature opt to do so again, the city’s Election Department “will be faced with a very tight turnaround” for printing and distributing ballots to voters between the September preliminary and November general elections, Tavares said. Ballots cannot be sent out until after the results of the preliminary election are certified — currently scheduled to be completed by Sept. 27, barring any needed recounts, according to Tavares. The city would receive printed ballots between Oct. 7 and 12 ahead of the Nov. 2 general election. “That leaves us with about three weeks to mail ballots to voters and for them to get back to the Election Department in enough time to be counted for the general election,” Taveres said. Former Mayor Marty Walsh, before leaving office to serve as U.S. secretary of labor last month, wrote to councilors urging them to make the shift. According to city officials, the change does not require approval from state lawmakers. Some councilors expressed hesitation over the switch. Councilor Kenzie Bok said voters often don’t begin tuning into an election until after Labor Day. “That has been my experience, so I’m worried about us losing another week,” she said. Councilor Ricardo Arroyo asked if officials could consider pushing back the general election by one week. “Why wouldn’t we preserve sort of the maximum amount of time for people to actually, you know, engage with this ballot?” Arroyo asked. Tavares said doing so would require a home rule petition, which would need approval from the state Legislature to take effect. While state officials have not expanded vote-by-mail to include this fall’s election, Taveres said the request aims to be proactive. “We don’t want to find ourselves in the position where vote-by-mail is expanded and then we’re scrambling to get something moved, and it’s probably not a good idea to change the date of the preliminary at the last minute either,” she said. Council President Pro Tempore Matt O’Malley backed the move. “I support any efforts that we can employ to make sure that as many people are able to vote safely and efficiently, and if that means moving the date of the preliminary election, then I absolutely support it,” he said. Secretary of State William Galvin told The Boston Globe he also supports the change. “From a public policy point of view it makes a lot of sense,” he said. Annissa Essaibi George says she opposes the controversial decision made last fall to temporarily suspend entrance tests typically required for Boston’s three exam schools. “I’m disappointed that we’re breaking something that works,” Essaibi George told WBZ’s Jon Keller on Sunday. “We’re breaking something that is an opportunity for so many of our kids, thousands of our kids, across the district.” The Boston School Committee voted unanimously in October to forgo the admissions test for incoming classes later this year. The move is intended to address racial disparities among the testing policies, as well as challenges raised by the coronavirus pandemic. A student’s eligibility for entrance to the schools will instead be based on grades, 2019 MCAS scores, and the student’s zip codes. On Thursday, a federal court judge upheld the new policy, ruling it does not discriminate against any students after the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence filed a lawsuit, alleging the policy was “wholly irrational,” The Boston Herald reports. “I think it was an important opportunity for us to think very creatively about how to uphold our commitment to our families and our kids across the district,” Essaibi George, a former East Boston High School teacher, told WBZ. “I think it was also a missed opportunity to take a well-intentioned intellectual, smart group of people to look at some of the real problems that exist within our school system.” But she also told Keller that there are “real concerns around diversity” in the district, particularly that Black and brown students have access to a good education. “The bigger problem is when a family does not gain admission to one of our three exam schools they feel left out, they feel left behind, and we have so much work to do when we think about all of our high schools across the district. …We have to create opportunities across the board,” she added. Almost half of Boston’s registered voters aren’t yet sure who they will be casting a ballot for in the mayor’s race this fall, an early poll released Wednesday shows. Approximately 46 percent of the 552 voters surveyed between April 7 and 11 by the MassINC Polling Group indicated they are undecided regarding who will get their vote. The poll, which carried a 5 percent margin of error, was sponsored by WBUR, The Dorchester Reporter, and The Boston Foundation. Michelle Wu has so far garnered the most support among the field of candidates, with 19 percent of voters who were contacted indicating they would most likely support her in the race. Kim Janey followed with 18 percent, Annissa Essaibi George with 6 percent, and Andrea Campbell with 4 percent. Jon Santiago and John Barros each received support from 3 percent of the voters surveyed. The survey also indicated candidates lacked name recognition with sizable portions of the voters surveyed, with 57 and 50 percent of voters polled indicating they had not heard of Santiago and Barros, respectively. Likewise, Essaibi George and Campbell were unknown to 44 and 42 percent of those surveyed. Wu was apparently the most familiar, with only 21 percent stating they had not heard of the city councilor at-large. Notably, candidates still have quite some time to get their names out and build support. The Sept. 21 preliminary election is over five months away. The general municipal election is set for Nov. 2. The #BOSMayor candidates have a long way to go introducing themselves to voters. Other than Wu, half or more of Boston's voters have either not heard of the other candidates, or have not formed an opinion of them. @WBUR / @DotNews poll. https://t.co/rqHL9imF00 pic.twitter.com/CBjeKhI2mM Some Boston mayoral candidates are calling for the release of internal affairs records regarding a former Boston police union president who is accused of molesting children over the course of three decades. A Boston Globe report published Saturday detailed the allegations against Patrick M. Rose Sr., including one dating to 1995. A criminal complaint filed against him at the time for allegedly sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy was dropped, but despite an internal affairs probe that concluded he probably committed a crime, he went on to serve another 21 years on the force, according to the newspaper. Since October, the Globe has sought internal affairs documents for Rose, which the city has refused to provide even though the state’s supervisor of public records said officials had failed to meet the legal requirements to retain the files. Former Mayor Marty Walsh’s administration maintained that the records could not be redacted in a manner that would meet a state law that requires the identities of victims of sexual assault and domestic abuse be protected. Some of acting Mayor Kim Janey’s fellow candidates and councilors are demanding she and other city officials make the files public. Here’s what they have said so far: Andrea Campbell “More than 24 hours after the Globe reported BPD covered up decades of alleged child molestation by a former officer and BPPA president, BPD and the Administration has yet to release or agree to release the records. This continued lack of transparency and accountability is unacceptable. Every minute of delay further erodes public trust and denies victims justice. Acting Mayor Janey should release these records immediately.” This continued lack of transparency and accountability is unacceptable. Every minute of delay further erodes public trust and denies victims justice. Acting Mayor Janey should release these records immediately. pic.twitter.com/2lZpkwpIXt Annissa Essaibi George “Release the records. The people who protect us should always be held to the highest possible standard. Our City institutions only work when they’re transparent & held accountable.

Time to take action & dig in for accountability through ongoing police contract negotiations.” This is a horrific breach of the public trust—continuing to this day with the City’s refusal to release internal affairs records for full transparency. Time to take action & dig in for accountability through ongoing police contract negotiations.https://t.co/k1ujH8SmSl Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced $2 million in reallocated funding Wednesday as part of commitments made by former mayor Marty Walsh to increase supplier diversity, after a study found that a combined 11 percent of city contracts in recent years went to businesses owned by women or people of color. The new goal, set by an executive order signed by Walsh, aims to direct 25 percent of contracts to businesses owned by women or people of color. According to Michelle Wu, it’s still not enough. In a tweet Thursday, the at-large city councilor and mayoral candidate called the new goal — which aims to direct 10 percent of contracts to minority-owned businesses and 15 percent to women-owned businesses — “paltry.” The new goal would amount to a significant increase compared to past spending; the city-commissioned study last year found just 2.5 percent of the $2.1 billion in city contracts from 2014 to 2019 went to minority-owned businesses, while 8.5 percent of the contracts went to businesses owned by white women. However, Wu noted that Black, Hispanic, and Asian residents make up more than half of the Boston population. “It’s simply not enough to stick with the paltry goal of 10% set by the last administration,” Wu wrote in response to the news of the initiative launched by Janey, who announced this week that she would enter the race for a full term. “Time for bold action & real change.” People of color make up more than half of Boston, yet the share of city contracts going to minority-owned businesses was 2.5%.It’s simply not enough to stick with the paltry goal of 10% set by the last administration. Time for bold action & real change.https://t.co/KJdX7XBBML Wu’s campaign didn’t provide a specific percentage when asked what goal Boston, which is 45 percent white, should set for increasing procurement diversity. Sarah Anders, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said it should be “much higher” than 10 percent for minority-owned businesses. Anders noted that Philadelphia aims to fill at least 35 percent of all contracts through a minority-, woman-, or disabled-owned business (and the city — which is 63 percent Black, Hispanic, or Asian — has done so at a rate of between 30 and 36 percent in recent years). Atlanta, which is 48 percent Black, has also directed 23 percent of contracts to Black-owned businesses, and a combined 37 percent to businesses owned by minorities and white women. “Boston should be setting the standard here and beating other cities, not falling well behind,” Anders said. Overall, 11.2 percent of businesses in Boston are owned by white women and 5.7 percent are owned by minorities, according to the city’s recent study. However, critics say the city should overshoot in its procurement diversity goals to close “entrenched” disparities and support entrepreneurship in communities previously shut out of the process. “We have to build the capacity of our businesses to be able to take advantage of these opportunities,” Janey said during an appearance Thursday on GBH’s “Boston Public Radio.” Her office announced “concrete actions” to advance that goal Wednesday, including a full-time, five-person team to develop inclusive procurement practices, monitor city contracts, provide technical assistance to businesses, and provide outreach to minority- and women-owned businesses. “This is the taxpayers’ dollars, and … we have a responsibility to spend them wisely,” Janey said. Jon Santiago is in the market for a new person to lead his mayoral bid, after his campaign manager, Victoria Williams, resigned six weeks into the job. As the Boston Herald first reported Tuesday night, Williams “left the campaign to pursue other opportunities,” according to Santiago’s campaign. “Thanks to her leadership, our organization has grown tremendously since launch day and is building citywide, neighborhood by neighborhood,” the campaign said in a statement. “We’re grateful for all that Victoria has done to lead us to this point.” Williams had previously spent half a decade in New Hampshire politics, working for Sen. Maggie Hassan for several years before becoming the state director for now-Tranportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s presidential campaign. Santiago’s campaign is now in the process of hiring a new campaign manager. With a call for bold leadership to address deep-rooted inequity as Boston climbs out of the COVID-19 pandemic, acting Mayor Kim Janey announced Tuesday she will seek a full term as the city’s chief executive this fall. “The work to address the challenges we face from COVID and racial inequalities that have been inherited from centuries of structural racism will take longer than a few months to change,” Janey said at a press conference in Roxbury’s Nubian Square. “It is going to take fearless leadership, bold action, and a commitment to doing the hard work to make Boston the equitable city our residents want, need, and deserve — and I am 100 percent committed to leading this change.” Read the full story. Andrea Campbell has picked up an endorsement from across the Charles River. Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui backed Campbell in the race to become Boston’s next mayor, Campbell’s campaign announced Monday. Siddiqui became the first Muslim person to serve as mayor of a Massachusetts city when she was elected to the position by her fellow Cambridge city councilors last year. She has served on the City Council since 2018. “I am proud to support Andrea Campbell for mayor of Boston, whose vision and plans to make Boston truly equitable for all will help our entire region,” Siddiqui said in a statement. “Andrea cares deeply, leads authentically, and works collaboratively to address the inequities she experienced growing up in Boston that too many families in our communities still face.” Campbell said she is “humbled and proud to have the support of Mayor Siddiqui, whose own leadership I admire and whose partnership in the work to ensure equitable opportunity for all I am grateful for.” “From our higher education institutions, public transit, and local economy, collaborative leadership between the City of Boston and City of Cambridge is essential to creating an inclusive, equitable, thriving community for our residents, students, and workforce,” Campbell said in a statement. Siddiqui most recently served as honorary co-chair of Boston acting Mayor Kim Janey’s transition committee. Janey, who entered office late last month, has not yet revealed whether she will be entering the race to seek a full term. According to The Boston Globe, an announcement regarding Janey’s intentions is expected this week. Annissa Essaibi George unveiled a public health policy plan on Wednesday, calling for more support to better position community health centers as the backbone of the city’s health care system. “There’s no question that this past year has amplified the conversation around the health and safety of our city and its residents. The pandemic has made it perfectly clear: our health care system, even in the world-class city of Boston, is broken. It has failed too many of our most vulnerable residents,” Essaibi George said in a statement. “My plan will not only see our city through an immediate recovery, but gives us a long-term vision to help Boston through the next chapter and build a stronger, equitable health care system for all.” The plan lays out a vision for tackling some of the city’s most pressing issues: recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, access to substance use recovery services, availability of mental and behavioral health services, and addressing health care as it relates to violence and trauma. Interwoven in that work should be more city-fostered partnerships with community health centers, according to the plan, which seeks to establish the centers as “the foundation of Boston’s health care system.” “As Mayor, Annissa will give them the necessary support in order to continue providing the best possible care to our most vulnerable residents,” the plan says. “These institutions have worked hard to build trust within the communities they serve and they will be critical partners in our work to increase access to care across all of Boston.” Specifically, Essaibi George pledged to dedicate city funding to support center initiatives; invest in “broader referral patterns between community health centers and city agencies;” create a public health care directory accessible through 311; and form a workforce development program with Boston Public Schools and higher education “to expand access to health care providers with racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity,” among other priorities. The plan also calls for strengthening connections between the health centers and state initiatives and local nonprofit organizations to improve accessibility to mental health and behavioral health services. According to Essaibi George’s campaign, the local health care centers can also help bridge racial disparities in health care. “Because along with a lack of coverage and care for too many, there are persistent racial inequities that plague our systems and everyday lives in this city – all leading to disparate health outcomes dependent on race, ethnicity, gender, immigration status, and the neighborhood in which you live,” her campaign said in a statement. “As community led institutions, CHCs are uniquely positioned to combat these, provide culturally competent care, and improve the health of all Bostonians.” Read the full plan. A “Restaurant Recovery Plan” released by Andrea Campbell this week seeks to set a cap on fees charged by third-party delivery companies to local eateries at 15 percent. The provision is among several Campbell says is needed to support the city’s restaurant industry as it works to survive and recover from the financial devastation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Boston’s restaurants ground us in the city’s rich cultural diversity and international identity, and are a key part of why people choose to live in the City,” Campbell said in a statement. “They are the site of our first date with our future partner, the places we gather with friends and family to celebrate milestones, and where co-workers become lifelong friends. “The restaurant industry is also the nation’s second largest private employer, creating low-barrier employment opportunities and driving economic activity in our neighborhoods,” she added. “Boston must do more to support restaurants through the remainder of the pandemic, and to accelerate a rapid recovery of our restaurant industry as soon as the pandemic is over.” The plan was developed with and backed by several local chefs and restaurant owners, including Michael Serpa, chef and partner at Back Bay restaurants Select Oyster Bar and Grand Tour, and Atlántico in the South End, and Cassandria Campbell, founding partner of Fresh Food Generation in Roxbury, according to Campbell’s campaign. Campbell’s vision calls for streamlining the city’s permitting and inspection processes by creating a “Hospitality Division” at City Hall and for convening a 15-member “Hospitality Advisory Council” to advise officials on industry-related policies. Campbell also wants the city to impose a cap on fees charged to restaurants by third-party companies such as GrubHub, Doordash, and UberEats. As more customers opted for takeout at the onset of the pandemic last year, city councilors considered the 15 percent cap on fees after learning companies charge restaurants between 10 to 30 percent of the price of an order. Restaurant owners said the measure was necessary to preserve their businesses while Grubhub pushed back on the effort, saying such a move would be government overstep. Other major companies did not take up invitations to testify before city officials. “The Massachusetts Legislature has passed a bill to cap delivery fees at 15 percent, and the bill is on Gov. (Charlie) Baker’s desk,” Campbell’s campaign website says. “Andrea will push for this to be implemented immediately to alleviate pressure on restaurants.” Other aspects of Campbell’s plan call for reforming the city’s process for granting liquor licenses. Campbell’s campaign noted licenses can often fetch six figures and only “a handful of Boston’s 1,100 liquor licenses are Black-owned.” Campbell also envisions expanding the city’s “Open Streets” initiative across the city to promote small businesses through creating public gathering spaces. Read the full plan. For the first time next month, the candidates in the Boston mayor’s race will gather — virtually — to take questions about how they would lead the city. The Boston Ward 4 and Ward 5 Democratic Committees announced Thursday morning that they will host the first mayoral forum of the 2021 race on April 20 from 6:30-8:30 p.m. on Zoom. The event will also be livestreamed on Facebook and organizers are inviting the public to submit questions online. The event, moderated by GBH host Callie Crossley, isn’t a debate, so don’t expect a frequent amount of back and forth between the candidates. But it’s still an opportunity for mayoral hopefuls to highlight and contrast their platforms. According to the forum hosts, all five currently declared candidates — John Barros, Andrea Campbell, Annissa Essaibi George, Jon Santiago, and Michelle Wu — have accepted invitations to participate. Additional candidates will be invited and announced as the field takes shape. Acting Mayor Kim Janey, fresh off taking the oath of office on Wednesday, told reporters she will make a decision on whether to seek a full term and enter the mayoral race in the coming weeks. “Right now, I’m focused on being mayor, but I will make a decision and an announcement in the coming weeks,” Janey said during a press conference at City Hall Plaza. Whether Janey, the District 7 city councilor, will enter the fray has been a major question mark since it became clear former mayor Marty Walsh would leave the job for the Department of Labor. Under the city charter, Janey — who, until this week, was the City Council president — was elevated to the mayor’s seat through this fall’s election. Janey appears to be giving the possibility of a run some serious thought. The acting mayor is soliciting donations via her transition website, in emails to supporters, and during an event held via Zoom Tuesday night ahead of her swearing-in ceremony. “We really want to grow our base,” a Janey aide told supporters there, according to Politico. “If she does decide to run, we want to be able to have her make that decision, not because of what is in the bank account.” Janey, a former education advocate, was first elected to the City Council in 2017. Although Marty Walsh is no longer the sitting mayor of Boston as of Monday night, he has no apparent plans to wade into the escalating race to choose his elected successor. The Dorchester Democrat, who was off to Washington D.C. on Tuesday to serve as President Joe Biden’s labor secretary, told reporters he will not endorse a candidate in this election cycle. “I will not be playing a role in the mayor’s race,” he said at a press conference shortly after the U.S. Senate confirmed his nomination to his new post. “It is not right for me to play a role in the mayor’s race.” Walsh said he personally knows all of the declared candidates to date, pointing to how one candidate grew up on the same street as him and others either worked for him or alongside him. “It’s no place for me to be involved,” he said. Still, Walsh acknowledged the historic nature of the race which boasts a diverse field of candidates — the majority of them women — made up entirely of minorities. “I think that the person who follows me as mayor, potentially will be a first — and that’s a good thing for the city,” he said. Walsh’s departure to the federal government blew open the mayoral race set for this fall, stoking rumors about who would enter the fray and who would sit it out. While several candidates launched campaigns when it became clear the popular incumbent would no longer be on the ballot, city councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell both declared their candidacies before a “Secretary Walsh” became probable. And Walsh, for his part, had planned to take them on in a bid for a third term, he said Monday. “I had a whole team of people and consultants and the whole deal. We ordered new bumper stickers, too,” Walsh said. “So if you want a bumper sticker we can do a good price on an old Marty Walsh bumper sticker. There’s like, two on cars right now.” Asked whether he’ll run for office sometime again, Walsh said he wasn’t sure. “God only knows. I didn’t expect to be secretary of labor so I don’t know what’s gonna happen,” he said. “I mean, I’m not gonna rule anything out but trust me, it’s not top of mind right now … I just want to do the best job I can do for the American people. There’s lots of work to do in Washington D.C.” After resigning from her post as Boston’s first equity chief earlier this month, Karilyn Crockett says she won’t be entering the mayor’s race — at least not this year. “The timing is not right for me to make a run this round, but I remain grateful and energized by our collective fight to make Boston a better, stronger and more equitable city for all of us every single day,” Crocket said in a Facebook post Sunday. The announcement comes after GBH reported that the 47-year-old Dorchester native was thinking about joining the increasingly crowded field against established candidates who had already built sizable political organizations. In her post Sunday, she thanked “everyone who reached out and encouraged” her to consider the race. “As a born and raised Dot girl, dreaming big for the city that raised me is one of my heart’s greatest joys,” Crockett wrote. Jon Santiago received two more endorsements Thursday from fellow Massachusetts state representatives from Boston. Reps. Mike Moran and Kevin Honan — two longtime Allston-Brighton legislators — backed Santiago in the Boston mayor’s race, calling the South End Democrat a “crisis leader” who would best lead the city’s recovery from the pandemic. Moran, the assistant House majority leader, cited Santiago’s work as an emergency room physician and efforts to distribute vaccines. Honan, the longest-serving House member and former Housing Committee chairman, said he had watched Santiago grow into “a convener, collaborator and doer who has become a leading voice on equity and opportunity for our city.” Santiago said he was honored to have the support of the two local “fixtures.” The news Thursday gives Santiago three supporters among Boston’s House delegation, following Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Aaron Michlewitz’s endorsement earlier this month. Andrea Campbell’s mayoral campaign released a sweeping transportation plan this week focused on creating “15-minute neighborhoods” and calling for increased investment in all modes of transit infrastructure — with the exception of cars. “Past decisions about street design and priorities emphasized moving cars through our neighborhoods as quickly as possible,” the plan says. “Now, it is time to prioritize movement of everyday residents within our neighborhoods.” Campbell’s plan goes onto embrace everything from more pedestrian-friendly streets to increased bike lanes to the legalization of electric scooters and e-bikes to ambitious expansions of the region’s train and ferry systems. “With city-led investments, intentional zoning, and mixed-use, transit-oriented development, residents can have everything they need — grocery stores, schools, parks, small businesses — within 15 minutes of their doorsteps,” the plan says. The 15-minute neighborhood concept is an idea that has increasingly been adopted by mayoral candidates in other cities across the country. Campbell’s plan includes hiring more planning staff to further accelerate projects, while also investing in community engagement and adding a “Safety Impact Review” layer to the approval process to assess the effect of developments on sidewalks and streets, as well as expanding pilot programs to replace street parking with outdoor dining and other walkable spaces. She also calls for eliminating fares on the MBTA bus system — a plank that fellow city councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu has championed — and increasing the number of bus-only lanes in Boston. Campbell also pledges to advocate for the long-delayed MBTA link connecting the Red and Blue lines, and even the use of the T’s Red Line test track to provide passenger service between the Dorchester, Roxbury, and Mattapan neighborhoods and the Seaport District. Her plan also voices support for a “regional rail” network (as opposed to one focused on commuters) that better connects Boston residents to jobs, family members in other communities, and places outside the city. It also envisions a more robust MBTA ferry system that services East Boston and Dorchester. “Boston has an historic opportunity to rebuild and reimagine our city’s transportation system with safe and well-connected streets, better buses, and less traffic and air pollution,” Campbell said. Read the full plan here. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Annissa Essaibi George is receiving the backing of the state’s largest nurses’ union. The Massachusetts Nurse Association announced Wednesday that they’re endorsing Essaibi George’s mayoral campaign, citing her advocacy for public health and frontline workers long before the pandemic. “Just as MNA nurses and healthcare professionals have always been on the frontlines of healthcare – during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond – Annissa has long dedicated herself to improving public health by elevating and meeting the social, environmental and emotional needs of all Boston residents,” Katie Murphy, the president of the 23,000-member union, said in a statement. The MNA noted that Essaibi George was one of the three Boston city councilors that filed a resolution last year (which was approved unanimously) in support of a nurse protest of staffing levels at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, as well as her advocacy for addressing the opioid epidemic, homelessness, and insufficient mental health care in Boston. The MNA also backed Marty Walsh in his victorious 2013 mayoral campaign. The group is known for its strong political advocacy and was the driving force behind the unsuccessful Question 1 statewide ballot measure in 2018. “Nurses show up,” Essaibi George said in a statement. “Before, during, and after a global pandemic, they show up day after day, night after night, to keep our residents safe and healthy,’ she said. “I’m proud to stand by their side as we continue to increase access to quality care, tackle health disparities, fight for workers’ rights, address our mental and behavioral health crisis, and ensure a safe, happy, and healthy future for every single Bostonian.” Kim Janey hasn’t said if she’ll run for a full term as mayor of Boston. However, the Boston City Council president and soon-to-be acting mayor’s new “mayoral transition” website certainly has the looks of a campaign. The refreshed website, which Janey announced Sunday, features webpages on the Roxbury native’s biography, transition team, and press coverage, as well as a link to donate to her campaign committee, which is still registered as a city council candidate account. The site’s search engine optimization headline simply states “Kim Janey | Mayor of Boston.” Janey has said she will seriously consider running for a full term as mayor, as she prepares to take over in the interim role in the wake of Mayor Marty Walsh’s impending departure to become President Joe Biden’s labor secretary. According to the Boston Herald, the District 7 city councilor also sent out a fundraising email Saturday promoting the new site. “From taking the bus to Charlestown as an 11-year-old girl, to taking the bus to City Hall as Boston’s first Black, first woman mayor, Kim Janey will be a mayor for every Bostonian,” reads the donation page. After scrutiny, discussion, the strokes of pens from both Mayor Marty Walsh and Gov. Charlie Baker, and lengthy public hearings, the home rule petition to forgo a Boston special election this year is apparently now a moot point. Last month, city officials signed off on the measure to nix an election required under the city charter to select Walsh’s successor as he anticipates becoming the nation’s next secretary of labor. Baker followed through with his own approval of the move just last week. The charter mandated an election be held should Walsh vacate his current post by March 5 — this Friday. Lawmakers, advocates, and others argued that with already scheduled preliminary and general elections this fall for the mayor’s seat, additional contests would only threaten to disenfranchise, confuse, and risk the health of voters during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to mention the price tag for the city. But as of Friday, the U.S. Senate had not confirmed Walsh to the post President Joe Biden tapped him to serve in, nor is there a vote scheduled, even nearly two months after the president officially nominated Walsh to his cabinet. Biden first announced that Walsh, a former union leader from Dorchester, was his pick to helm the Department of Labor on Jan. 7. The mayor was questioned by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions in a rather mild hearing on Feb. 4, and that same committee voted 18-4 to advance Walsh’s nomination to a Senate vote the following week. The Senate, of course, had a busy February. Federal lawmakers held an impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump and ultimately voted to acquit him of the charge of inciting the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The Senate is now engaged in debate over Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which would, in part, grant eligible Americans $1,400 stimulus payments if approved. According to the Associated Press, Biden’s cabinet is forming at “the slowest pace of any in modern history” with a little over a dozen nominees confirmed as of Tuesday. That day, the Senate voted to confirm Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo to serve as secretary of commerce. Raimondo was, notably, nominated by Biden on the same day as Walsh. Karilyn Crockett, the city’s first equity chief, is resigning from her post on Friday after just over eight months on the job. And according to GBH, which first reported Crockett’s resignation, sources close to the 47-year-old Dorchester native say that she is weighing a run to be Boston mayor. Crocket, who was on leave from her assistant professor position at MIT to lead the city’s Office of Equity, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An automatic reply from her city email Thursday said that she had “completed my service as Chief of Equity for the City of Boston but our work steadily continues.” Read the full story here. After deciding against running for Boston mayor himself, state Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, a North End Democrat and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, announced Thursday that he’s endorsing fellow state Rep. Jon Santiago in what’s now a five-person race. “Our city stands on the precipice of a new era of leadership and I know Jon’s experience as a doctor, a veteran, a Peace Corps volunteer, and as a state representative make him the most qualified to lead us into that new era,” Michlewitz said in a statement. “He will help us recover as a city and region.” The endorsement comes after Santiago announced Wednesday that his campaign had raised more than $274,000 in the month of February, after officially entering the race last Tuesday following weeks of speculation. The haul was, narrowly, the largest monthly fundraising total of any candidate in the Boston mayoral race (Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell raised $267,130 and $272,288, respectively, in January). Santiago said Thursday that he was “humbled” to receive Michlewitz’s support. “Having worked with Chairman Michlewitz on Beacon Hill to deliver urgently needed results for our city and state, I’ve seen firsthand how much he cares about our city and expanding opportunity for all,” he said. John Barros will launch his campaign to become Boston’s next mayor Thursday morning, becoming the fifth candidate in what’s shaping up to be a crowded race. The announcement comes after weeks of speculation that the city’s longtime economic development chief would run for the office, which was further fueled by his resignation last week from that post. Read the full story here. City Councilor and candidate for mayor Andrea Campbell on Monday released an environmental plan geared around climate justice, focusing in particular on communities of color that have disproportionately shouldered the impacts of climate change and other issues for decades. “The climate crisis is a public health crisis and its impacts are visible everyday, from the flooding on Morrissey Boulevard to the devastating health disparities and COVID-19 mortality in communities of color due to higher rates of air pollution,” Campbell said in a statement. “With plans that center environmental justice and equitably invest in climate resiliency, Boston can lead the nation in tackling the climate crisis while building an equitable, sustainable economy and improving public health.” Campbell’s vision outlines five strategies, from putting environmental justice at the forefront and creating pathways to green economy jobs, to prioritizing sustainability and resiliency in public property, reducing traffic and transportation emissions, and rolling out more sustainable housing and development. The District 4 city councilor vowed to work with communities of color “and those most vulnerable to climate-related disasters” to make certain that projects built in their neighborhoods are climate resilient and meet city environmental priorities. Elsewhere in the proposal, Campbell eyed making city-owned buildings and vehicles carbon neutral by 2035, increasing energy efficiency in Boston Public Schools, and putting in place additional waste reduction strategies such as curbside composting as city-operated services, among other ideas. The plan frames Boston’s potential for being a national and global urban leader in cutting down carbon emissions and boosting the use of green technology. “Today, more than half of the world’s population lives in cities and those cities are responsible for over 70 percent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions,” the plan says. “Because our national leaders have largely ignored this crisis, Boston must rise up and show how cities can indeed address the climate crisis by engaging all communities including communities of color, and in a way that makes cities and local economies more resilient, equitable, and sustainable.” Read the full plan. BOSTON (AP) — A measure aimed at eliminating the need for a special election in Boston if Mayor Marty Walsh steps down to become President Joe Biden’s labor secretary was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday. The home rule petition, which was approved by the Boston City Council and state lawmakers, aims to avoid the need to conduct a special election just months before holding the regular municipal election in the fall. Both the special election and regular municipal election would have required holding preliminary and general elections — essentially four elections in Boston in the space of less than a year. If Walsh is confirmed and steps down, current City Council President Kim Janey will assume the role of interim mayor until the fall election. She will be the first woman and first Black Bostonian to serve as mayor. There are four declared candidates for the top City Hall post, including three women of color who are also all city councilors: Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell and Annissa Essaibi George, and Democratic state Rep. Jon Santiago, who is Latino. No woman and no person of color has served as mayor of Boston in the city’s long history. — Associated Press After more than seven years as Boston’s economic development chief, John Barros is stepping down this week. Mayor Marty Walsh’s office confirmed Wednesday that Barros submitted his resignation letter last Friday saying that this upcoming Friday, Feb. 26, will be his last day. “John has been a valued member of my team, and we’re grateful for all of his work on behalf of the people of Boston,” Walsh said in a statement. “We wish him well as he starts this new chapter.” The letter, which was first reported Tuesday night by The Boston Globe, comes amid speculation that Barros will become the fifth candidate to enter the city’s open mayoral race, in the wake of Walsh’s expected confirmation as President Joe Biden’s labor secretary. Barros, who also ran for mayor in 2013, told the Globe earlier this month that he’s having “really encouraging conversations across the city” about a potential campaign. Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell is proposing to reallocate at least 10 percent of the Boston Police Department’s budget — or roughly $50 million — to invest in public health, economic justice, and youth development strategies as part of a sweeping public safety plan released Wednesday. “It’s time we reimagine our approach to public safety to address root causes of violence and crime, and invest in strategies that support public health, economic justice, and youth development to heal and empower our communities and break cycles of generational poverty, trauma, and incarceration,” Campbell, whose life has been deeply impacted by the criminal justice system, said in a statement. The plan comes after Mayor Marty Walsh said in June that he would shift $12 million from the BPD’s overtime budget to community programs aimed at reducing inequality in the city (though city councilors have questioned if the city will meet that goal). To make another $50 million in cuts, Campbell is floating budget reforms such as eliminating the four-hour overtime minimum; transferring certain overtime jobs, such as construction details, to civilians; scaling back the Boston Regional Intelligence Center; and eliminating the department’s gang and bike units to free up capacity for the city’s busiest police districts. Her wide-ranging plan also calls for a new “co-responder” system — a model that involves law enforcement officers and clinicians working together — to respond to non-violent 911 calls. It would also make direct investments in youth job and development programs and in revitalization initiatives in communities considered “hot spots.” Additionally, Campbell’s plan would remove police from Boston Public Schools by eliminating the role of school resource officer and using those funds to invest in more school counselors, nurses, and clinicians. Campbell says she would also implement Boston’s recently established police accountability office, as well as approve an ordinance to severely limit the use of military enforcement tactics like tear gas and rubber bullets by Boston police, which was vetoed last month by Walsh. “As mayor, I will ensure our Boston Police Department is the most transparent and accountable in the nation, make Boston a leader in criminal justice reform and effective reentry, shift our school safety approach to a restorative justice model, and ensure all Bostonians feel safe in their communities,” Campbell said. Teamsters Local 25, the largest Teamsters union in New England, is endorsing Michelle Wu to be the next mayor of Boston. “Michelle Wu is a strong leader who will stand-up for our members during this unprecedented time when greedy corporations are trying to expand profits at the expense of workers,” Sean O’Brien, the Charlestown-based union’s president, said in a statement Tuesday, calling the at-large city councilor a “relentless” fighter for better wages, health insurance, retirement benefits and improved working conditions. “As the daughter of immigrants, Michelle shares our vision for the City of Boston, with an understanding that access to training and other neighborhood resources will help the working class that makes this city great,” O’Brien said. Local 25 is one of eight Massachusetts-based local Teamster chapters, and comprises more than half of the state’s 23,000 Teamster members. The union also endorsed Mayor Marty Walsh in the city’s last open mayor’s race. “Knowing that the 12,500 hardworking members of Teamsters Local 25 have my back in the race to become the next elected mayor of Boston is a great honor,” Wu said Tuesday. In 2018, the so-called Wakanda I initiative successfully helped rally Black voters around Rachael Rollins in the Suffolk County district attorney’s race. Now, community leaders are hoping for a sequel. According to The Boston Globe, former state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson is spearheading an effort dubbed WAKANDA II, intended to unite the city’s Black voters around a single candidate of color in the wide-open 2021 mayoral race. The effort may also expand to the up to four City Council seats that could open up this cycle. “We have an opportunity here to upend and reshape the whole composition of the city government, and we’re going to take it,” Wilkerson told the Globe. Currently, while all four candidates in the Boston mayor’s race are people of color, only one, City Councilor Andrea Campbell, is Black. However, two other Black candidates may join the field: soon-to-be acting mayor Kim Janey, the City Council president, is considering running for a full term. And the city’s economic development chief, John Barros, is also expected to run. The effort comes after two white men, Marty Walsh and John Connolly, emerged from the 12-person preliminary mayoral field in 2013, in which half the candidates were Black or Hispanic. Boston has never elected a woman or person of color as mayor. Wilkerson’s effort does some have detractors in the Black community, who called such moves to coalesce support around one candidate at the expense of others “brutal” and “presumptuous.” But Wilkerson says they’re not asking anyone to drop out and that the group — which so far includes 150 people in the area — will make a decision based on a questionnaire sent to mayoral hopefuls with questions about issues like education, criminal justice reform, housing, and systemic racism. “We expect people will make whatever decision that makes sense for them, but we will be clear that once we’re settled on a candidate, we’re going all in,” she told the Globe. Jon Santiago is making it official. The second-term Massachusetts state representative, who also serves as an emergency room physician at Boston Medical Center and as a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve, announced Tuesday that he is seeking a new job: mayor of Boston. “The only reason I got into politics is because I wanted to have a bigger impact,” Santiago told Boston.com in an interview, highlighting the stark inequalities that have only been deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Read the full story of his campaign launch here. Annissa Essaibi George released the first video of her 2021 mayoral campaign Wednesday, “Every Bostonian, Every Experience,” in which the Dorchester native and first-generation American pledges to listen and learn from Boston residents across the city. “It has to be every experience that informs the work,” Essaibi George says, leaning on her own unique background. The daughter of immigrants, Essaibi George, a city councilor, is the mother of four sons and the owner of a small sewing shop in Dorchester. But the video released Wednesday primarily highlights her experience as a teacher at East Boston High School. “I know without a doubt I was elected because of my years in the classroom,” she says in video, adding that she had “a front row seat” to the housing insecurity, food insecurity, and lack of economic opportunity that many students faced. “To have a teacher in the mayor’s office, leading with those experiences will have such an impact on our families across the city,” she said. “I’m running for mayor, not just to get through this crisis. I want to be mayor of this city for its future, for this period of sustained recovery and rebirth.” Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell is calling on the city to hold a “Teacher Vaccination Week” in order to more quickly reopen schools for in-person learning. While not fully formed, Campbell’s campaign says the idea is intended to promote the mass vaccination of teachers in Boston, including vaccination sites specifically dedicated for the city’s educators and school staff, when they become eligible under the state’s three phase rollout. “Many Boston families are desperate for their children to return to in-person learning, and I believe it’s critical that all families have the opportunity to do so – safely – before the end of this school year,” Campbell said in a press release Tuesday. “We also need to make sure that our teachers’ health and safety is protected.” The idea headlines Campbell’s long-term education plan, released less than two weeks before Boston Public Schools begins its phased return to in-person learning next month. While a majority of states have allowed at least some teachers to get the COVID-19 vaccine, Massachusetts is not one of them. Currently, staffers from early education through high school are in the third group of Phase 2 of the state’s vaccine rollout. It’s unclear when that stage will begin. Recently released federal guidelines are encouraging the mass vaccination of teachers as a strategy for reopening schools, though not necessarily as a prerequisite. Andrea Campbell on Thursday urged state officials to either rescind or revise a new policy unveiled only one day earlier that allows people who accompany eligible, senior vaccine recipients to also receive vaccine doses. The call comes as Craigslist advertisements from across the state have cropped up with offers for free rides to seniors ages 75 and older — the demographic that can receive the shot — in exchange for the opportunity to join them at their appointments. “While it may have been well-meaning, it took less than 24 hours for this new state policy to be abused,” Campbell said in a statement. “It’s the wrong approach when those who need it most — seniors, essential workers, teachers, Black and brown residents in communities where infection rates are highest — are still waiting for their chance to be vaccinated.” Campbell noted that with health disparities, “Black people, especially Black men, often don’t make it to 75.” State officials should either rescind the policy or limit who may accompany eligible patients to only Massachusetts residents who are 65 and older, “and immediately open up appointments to these other individuals,” Campbell said. Gov. Charlie Baker, on Thursday, said it was “pretty disturbing” that some were trying to take advantage of the program through those kinds of offers. “If you’re 75 years or older and you need assistance going through the vaccination process, you should only reach out to somebody that you know or trust to bring you as your companion,” Baker said. The policy is intended for someone like a child, spouse, neighbor, or caregiver to tag along, he said. “Don’t take calls or offers from people you don’t know well or trust, and never share your personal information with anyone,” Baker said. “If you’re contacted by somebody soliciting to take you to a site, please report it to the authorities.” Boston’s economic development chief, John Barros, is reportedly on the verge of launching a second campaign for mayor — and with the backing of the spouse of one of the city’s most influential elected officials. The Boston Globe reported Saturday that Conan Harris, the husband of Rep. Ayanna Pressley, has been encouraging Barros to enter the race to replace Mayor Marty Walsh, which currently consists of three of the Massachusetts congresswoman’s former City Council colleagues. “John is a Boston guy,’’ Harris, who worked with Barros as a fellow member of Walsh’s administration, told the Globe. “He grew up in Boston, he’s attended Boston schools and he’s worked in Boston.” The two men reportedly became close friends during their time together at City Hall. Harris served as Boston’s deputy director of public safety and as the executive director of the city’s My Brother’s Keeper partnership for several years up until 2020 when he left to launch a private consulting firm. Barros, who placed sixth in Boston’s 2013 mayoral preliminary election, has been the city’s chief of economic development since 2014. According to the Globe, supporters say the Roxbury native would provide continuity in the midst of a tumultuous year. Barros, who is 47, told the Globe that he is having ““really encouraging conversations across the city.” Pressley herself has yet to make any endorsements in what’s currently a three-way race between councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell, and Annissa Essaibi George. —Nik DeCosta-Klipa State Rep. Jon Santiago isn’t officially in the race to be Boston mayor, but the South End Democrat does think someone with his skillset would be well suited for the job. “There’s no doubt that this mayoral election will be, I would argue, the most consequential race in Boston’s history,” Santiago said during an appearance Sunday on WCVB’s “On The Record.” “We have a virus that has upended our society, our schools, our economy, our health care system,” he continued. “I think what I’m most worried about is what’s the Boston that will come back from this. And I would argue that the next two, three, four years really needs to be rooted in equity and opportunity, and I think that my skills and track record — be it in my ER physician role, state representative role, or as serving in the United States military — really lends itself to address those issues and leading Boston through that crisis.” The interview comes after multiple outlets reported last week that Santiago has privately decided to run. Santiago said Sunday that he’s taking a “hard look” at the race, discussing the idea with family, friends, and colleagues both at Boston Medical Center and on Beacon Hill. “My wife has veto power,” he said, adding that he expects to announce a decision in the “next couple weeks.” —Nik DeCosta-Klipa And then there were four? Massachusetts state Rep. Jon Santiago, a South End Democrat, is reportedly on the verge of entering the race to replace Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, joining the three city councilors who have already declared their candidacies. According to a Politico report Friday morning, two sources who had spoken with Santiago said the South End Democrat has been privately telling allies and others that he’s decided to run for mayor. The report comes after a Boston Globe article Thursday night similarly suggested that a decision has already been made: One person who spoke to Santiago told the Globe the lawmaker called him late last week, saying he intends to run and asked for his support. Another person said the 38-year-old hasn’t said he will launch a campaign, but that he is trying to gauge who he could include on a potential staff and finetune what his message would be. According to the Globe, Santiago said he’s still “seriously considering” a campaign. An emergency room physician at Boston Medical Center and Army Reserve captain, Santiago defeated longtime state Rep. Byron Rushing to win his seat in 2018. He has also become a prominent voice since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, using his Twitter account to provide a firsthand perspective of the virus’s toll, especially on communities of color. Santiago, who would also be the first man to enter the Boston mayoral race, also got a big shout out earlier this week from Red Sox President Sam Kennedy during a press conference at the new Fenway Park vaccination site. “I call him Superman,” said Kennedy, who has previously donated to Santiago’s campaign. “He’s on the frontlines dealing with the crisis at Boston Medical, he served his country overseas, helping us protect our troops. He’s a great leader in our city.” —Nik DeCosta-Klipa Boston city councilor and 2021 mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell characterized the emergence of a 1999 domestic violence allegation against newly appointed Police Commissioner Dennis White as a “failure to properly vet” the longtime cop by Mayor Marty Walsh’s administration. But she also said the issue is “bigger” than just that. “The systemic lack of accountability for wrongdoing and transparency in BPD is a trend, from serious domestic violence allegations that are swept under the rug to BPD officers’ potential participation in the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and complaints about the repeated use of excessive force against Black and brown people and peaceful protesters,” Campbell said in a lengthy statement Thursday reacting to the news. This is bigger than the Administration’s failure to properly vet a candidate to lead our police department.  The… “Until we have this kind of public accountability and transparency, BPD will continue to struggle to properly serve, build trust with our communities, and create an internal culture that encourages officers to root out wrongdoing,” she added. “This hurts residents as well as officers who show up every day to exercise their duties honorably.” White was sworn in as BPD commissioner on Monday after his predecessor, William Gross, abruptly announced last Thursday that he was retiring the following day. However, the city placed the 32-year veteran of the force on leave Wednesday, after The Boston Globe inquired about an allegation that White pushed and threatened to shoot his then-wife in 1999 and was later ordered to stay away from his family. Campbell, who has called for a stronger police oversight board, said the incident was part of a “pattern.” The surfacing of the allegations against White come after an investigation was launched into whether another officer attended the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, the emergence of footage of officers using force against nonviolent protesters, and revelations about an officer accused of sexual assault. “I will continue to push the City to investigate this wrongdoing, and ensure the City immediately implements the Office of Police Accountability and Transparency along with other essential policing reforms,” she said, to the city’s recently created police oversight office. Campbell’s statement was echoed Thursday afternoon by fellow councilor and mayoral hopeful Michelle Wu. “The City must investigate these very serious allegations, and I urge our next Commissioner to lead a complete overhaul of the culture and lack of transparency at BPD,” Wu told Boston.com in a statement Thursday afternoon (Walsh appointed Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief Gregory Long to serve as acting commissioner while the city investigates White). The calls come after Councilor Annissa Essaibi George, who became the third candidate to enter the mayoral race last week, tweeted Wednesday night that she supported Walsh’s move to place White on leave and launch an investigation. “Every possible incident of domestic violence is a big deal,” Essaibi George said. “There are no exceptions. We deserve to know that the leaders we trust to keep our community safe can live up to the highest possible standard in their own lives.” I support the Mayor’s call for an immediate investigation into these matters so we can put our focus where it belongs: preventing domestic violence, protecting victims, and keeping our neighborhoods safe. 2/2 Michelle Wu says if elected mayor, she would explore the possibility of creating a city-owned broadband network to bring affordable Internet access to every resident and business. The at-large city councilor raised the idea in her five-part plan, “Building a Connected City: Digital Equity Through Boston’s Recovery & Beyond,” unveiled Tuesday. The agenda aims to strengthen the city’s digital infrastructure, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed inequity in access to reliable Internet. In Boston, almost 15 percent of households do not have an Internet subscription and over 32,000 households — primarily for Black, Latinx, and immigrant residents — do not have any Internet access, according to Wu’s campaign. “The pandemic has made it clear that the digital divide reinforces every inequity across our city. As we plan for Boston’s recovery, we must urgently recognize Internet connectivity and hardware as critical infrastructure,” Wu said in a statement. “It’s time to build connected communities through digital equity across our neighborhoods.” A municipal broadband network is one avenue the city could explore, according to Wu. Elsewhere in the plan, Wu calls for creating “digital resource and learning hubs” in schools, community centers, and libraries for students and families, seniors, job seekers, and aspiring entrepreneurs to use for accessing the Internet and various technology and learning digital skills. The plan also outlines conducting an audit of public buildings to find ways to upgrade infrastructure and remove barriers to affordable and reliable Internet service. “Given the expense of home Internet plans, approximately 8 percent of households in Boston access the Internet exclusively through a smartphone plan, constantly monitoring data usage to remain within their monthly data limit, for fear of incurring burdensome fees or losing service altogether,” the plan says. “While the City works with partners to expand affordability and access to home Internet options, digital tools should meet residents where they are as they move throughout the city. The MBTA has already extended WiFi to the commuter rail, but we need City leadership to close gaps through an equity lens.” To do that, the city should use its resources to install free and secure public WiFi at bus stops and along routes, and work with the MBTA to receive federal and state funding to expand WiFi to subway stations, according to Wu’s plan. Other points in the agenda call for a need to strengthen access to telemedicine beyond the pandemic. Wu suggests creating dedicated spaces for city employees to use for telehealth appointments and encouraging private employers to follow suit. “Telemedicine by phone or video can dramatically expand access to physical and mental healthcare services – even outside of the pandemic,” the plan says. “But we must continue working swiftly to address the digital gaps that act as a barrier to accessing care. With City leadership, telemedicine can equitably connect our residents with and remove barriers to essential health services.” Wu’s latest plan comes on the heels of a major fundraising month for the campaign. In January, Wu took in over $267,000 with almost 1,800 individual donors — the most Wu has raised in a single month since declaring her candidacy in September, according to an email sent to supporters on Tuesday. Fellow city councilor and mayoral hopeful Andrea Campbell this week also reported January as her best fundraising month on the campaign trail to date. The windfall arrived as Mayor Marty Walsh announced he accepted President Joe Biden’s offer to serve as secretary of labor pending confirmation by the U.S. Senate, essentially ending the possibility Walsh would seek a third term. Read Wu’s full digital equity plan. City Councilor and mayoral hopeful Andrea Campbell says voters should keep Boston’s history with and ongoing dialogue on race front of mind as they consider selecting the city’s next mayor. Campbell, in an appearance Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Week with Joshua Johnson,” said Boston has a “unique opportunity that we won’t necessarily get (again) anytime soon … to confront our own painful history of racism, segregation.” “To do that we need leadership not only that is bold and courageous, but leadership that understands those inequities, and has lived them,” Campbell said, when asked why voters should choose her. We have a unique opportunity to confront a history of racism that has created generational inequities here in Boston, but to do that we need leadership that not only understands those inequities, but has lived them. Thanks for having me @TheWeekMSNBC @NBCJoshua! https://t.co/n31JIEgExR The District 4 city councilor and Boston native launched her campaign in September, shortly after fellow City Councilor Michelle Wu announced her run. Last week, City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George entered the race following news Mayor Marty Walsh was tapped by President Joe Biden to serve as secretary of labor. “Boston has a lot of things to deal with, as does every major city,” Johnson told Campbell on Sunday. “It’s kind of why I love covering mayoral politics, because as mayor, you can’t hide behind rhetoric, you have to get things done. You have to pave potholes… “But where should Bostonians put this dialogue about race and gender and the city’s history in their considerations along with paving potholes, improving the T, thinking through the city’s future, vaccinating residents?” Johnson added. “How does that fit into the mix of how residents should pick their next mayor?” Campbell responded: “It should be front and center.” She referenced how the nation experienced the death of George Floyd last year and the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol building last month. “White supremacists and race and racism and marginalization, segregation — it is real,” Campbell said. “And so this is our opportunity in the city of Boston to say if we’re going to move forward and ensure that our city provides equitable access, not only of course, to testing and vaccines in the midst of COVID, but to opportunity generally, then we have to confront our painful history of race and racism, which allows persistent inequities in the city of Boston, whether in education, housing, policing, our criminal legal system, to persist. “And if we are going to eradicate those inequities, we have to grapple with the root causes,” she continued. “And we need a leader who is unafraid to do that, and I’m not afraid.” Campbell’s campaign received a notable boost in January with news of Walsh’s planned departure to Washington, D.C., pending his Senate confirmation. On Monday, the campaign reported raising over $275,000 last month, with most of the cash pouring in after Walsh announced he accepted Biden’s nomination. The haul — of which just over $272,000 came from some 900-plus donors — is also the largest Campbell has raised in a single month to date. According to the campaign, Campbell has now brought in almost $600,000 since announcing her run — more than any other Black candidate for mayor has ever raised in Boston. Watch the full MSNBC interview. Boston is facing what is already shaping up to be a historic election year as city councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell, and Annissa Essaibi George are running to become the city’s next mayor. Never before have there been three women — all of them of color — at a single time seeking the city’s top job, an office that has only been held by white men. Each has offered how their lived experiences would serve to better address longstanding inequalities and disparities plaguing communities across the city. Wu, 35, kicked off her campaign in September. The Chicago native and at-large councilor asserted that Boston needs “leadership that matches the scale and urgency of our challenges,” from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to the push to tackle systemic racism. “Business as usual has been failing Bostonians since well before the pandemic, and COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated deep inequities across our city,” Wu said at the time. “In this moment of crisis, it’s not only possible but necessary to reimagine community-based leadership with the vision and conviction to act.” Campbell, 38, announced her run shortly after Wu last fall. The District 4 councilor, who grew up in Boston, has said she experienced the inequity of the city firsthand and has set her sights on addressing the stark contrast between lower-income Black and brown communities and the city’s downtown economic centers. “In this profound moment of reckoning for our country and our city, as people rise up to demand change, Boston needs leadership that not only understands, but has lived the systemic inequities facing our residents every day,” Campbell said in a statement in September. “I’m running for Mayor to be that leader, to bring our city together to confront inequities head-on, and finally make Boston a City that works for everyone.” Since Wu’s and Campbell’s entrances to the race, however, the campaign landscape saw a major change-up in January when Mayor Marty Walsh was selected as President Joe Biden’s nominee for labor secretary. With the possibility of a popular incumbent no longer on the ballot, officials from across the city began pondering their own chances at becoming Walsh’s successor. So far, Essaibi George, 47, who announced her run last week, is the only candidate to have joined the race following news of Walsh’s likely imminent departure. The at-large city councilor outlined the work needed to bring the city out of the coronavirus pandemic, and set a focus on existing inequalities present in issues like housing and healthcare that have only been exacerbated by the health crisis. “I’m running for mayor because I believe in a Boston that sees inequity, everyday injustices, the wrongs, and tackles them head on,” Essaibi George said. “I believe in a Boston that lifts up every neighborhood and embraces all who call it home.” With a long road to go until the September primary election — presuming the City Council is successful in nixing a special election prior to that, an effort they’re expected to vote on this week — voters should expect to see a few more names join the ballot. Marty Martinez, the city’s chief of health and human services, confirmed last month he is considering a possible mayoral campaign. City Councilor At-Large Michael Flaherty also indicated he has been weighing a run. According to Politico, also on that list are: state Sen. Nick Collins, a South Boston Democrat; John Barros, Boston’s chief of economic development; and state Rep. Jon Santiago, a Boston Democrat. Speculation has also centered on City Council President Kim Janey, who would become acting mayor should Walsh be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Janey has not personally expressed interest in seeking a full term, although her friends told The Boston Globe they would be “surprised if she does not give it strong consideration.” Meanwhile, several other suspected, potential candidates have confirmed they will not seek Walsh’s seat. North End Democratic state Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins announced last month they will not be entering the race. Former Boston Police Commissioner William Gross, soon after announcing his retirement last week, also said that despite coming close to embarking on a campaign, he opted not to follow through. “I follow my heart, and I made a promise to my family,” Gross told WBZ. “We planned out retirement.” Stay up to date on all the latest news from Boston.com  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

373,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/18/california-ghost-guns-deadly-toll,"Loopholes surrounding these weapons make them untraceable – and a hot commodity in many vulnerable communities Last modified on Wed 19 May 2021 11.38 BST When Brian Muhammad, a program manager at a gun violence prevention group in California, asked a 16-year-old boy in 2018 how young people were getting guns, he assumed the answer would be Nevada, the neighboring state with looser gun laws. “Who would waste time going to Nevada when you can just get them in the mail and put it together?” the Stockton teen nonchalantly replied.  Three years later, homemade weapons known as “ghost guns” have risen to the top of the Biden administration’s policy agenda. When the president announced executive actions targeting gun violence after the mass shootings in Georgia, California and Colorado, they included steps to regulate the sale of the devices – the first time the federal government took up such efforts. Warnings about do-it-yourself guns have steadily grown in recent years, spurred by ominous news stories describing the weapons’ use in a slew of mass shootings, domestic terrorism cases and gun trafficking busts. In California alone, homemade guns were used in a 2013 mass shooting in Santa Monica, a 2014 bank robbery in Stockton and a shooting spree in rural Tehama county that killed six in 2017. In 2019, a 16 year old killed two students and injured three others before killing himself with a ghost gun at a school in Santa Clarita. The next year, as protests over police violence filled city streets, Steven Carrillo used a homemade machine gun to shoot two security guards at a federal building in Oakland and a sheriff’s deputy in an ambush in Santa Cruz. But as the role of ghost guns in high profile criminal cases has grown, community violence reduction workers warn of the less visible toll ghost guns are taking : ghost guns, they say, have become a hot commodity in many vulnerable communities, a trend that has only intensified during the pandemic. The ease with which these guns can be ordered and constructed, and the difficulties in tracing them have made them readily available in many California cities, the organizers say. Their rapid spread, combined with Covid-19 limitations to the in-person contact so many violence interrupters rely on, have created a dangerous combination that is contributing to the surge in gun deaths that began last year. “We have people buying guns on the street at a faster pace. We can’t keep up with the number of guns especially when they may be more accessible than social services for some,” said Muhammad, of the Advance Peace program, a gun violence prevention organization, in Stockton. Antoine Towers, the chair of Oakland’s Violence Prevention Coalition, said he first heard about ghost guns at the beginning of the pandemic. First from friends who bought a ghost gun and assembled it, next up were some family members, then his co-workers. Gun ownership in Black communities in California rose significantly during the pandemic, mass protests and election chaos of 2020, and Towers’ network was opting for ghost guns rather than buying full-priced guns from stores that were inundated with sales. Soon, Towers said, ghost guns started showing up at his work. “We already had a problem with firearms, but it became really ridiculous,” Towers said. “[Ghost guns] are so easy to get right now that the only solution I see is figuring out a way to make sure people who have them aren’t using them. It’s heartbreaking.” Once a niche hobby among gun enthusiasts, do-it-yourself gun kits have been around since the 1990s, but they’ve increasingly become a feature on the nightly news since the early 2010s. The guns aren’t subject to traditional firearm sale mandates, including background checks and serial numbers, because of a legal loophole. Since they are shipped in several pieces, they fall out of the bounds of what the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) classifies as a legal firearm. “The argument is that they can’t fire in the condition they’re sold in. Because they require some assembly, they’re not firearms,” said Eric Tirschwell, the managing director of litigation for Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun violence prevention advocacy group. Previously, police say, they mostly found ghost guns during large gun busts and underground trafficking operations. But in the past two years, they are more frequently turning up in the backs of cars or the hands of individuals. Increasingly popular among gun owners, the guns have also become an interesting business proposition for traffickers. Tina Padilla, a peacekeeper with Breaking Through Barriers to Success (BTBS), a Los Angeles-based violence prevention nonprofit, said she first heard about ghost guns on the news a few years ago, especially after mass shootings. Then she heard some young people trickle into the nonprofit’s office discussing their purchases and what kits they were eyeing in passing conversation. “I learned the logistics of getting a ghost gun from working in the community and found out that they can be purchased from different sites, with different credit cards to different addresses and the government can’t trace who’s buying these guns and where they’re going,” Padilla said. “Now, instead of people having to purchase weapons for $600 to $700, they can buy them on the computer, put them together and use them on the street,” said Padilla. Police in Stockton first became familiar with ghost guns in 2014, when a homemade AK-47 was recovered after a deadly bank robbery that turned into a hostage situation and hour-long car chase. In 2019, the department recovered 42 ghost guns. And in 2020, it seized 175, nearly four times as many. The ATF has been recovering more ghost guns in the US each year. In 2019, they seized more than 7,100 and in 2020 that number grew to 8,712, according to department data. Police departments in other California cities have reported similar rises. San Francisco police started tracking ghost guns in 2016, and found six that year. In 2019, they recovered 77 and, in 2020, the number leaped to 164. Los Angeles county police found 813 ghost guns in 2020. In Oakland, 16% of all guns seized by police in 2020 were ghost guns. So far in 2021, 22% are ghost guns. Violence intervention workers say the rise in ghost guns has played some role in the rise in gun deaths recorded in cities all across America. “There’s a whole industry of people who are making guns and in this digital age the difficulty factor isn’t there, so if a person wants a gun they can get it,” said Muhammad, the Advanced Peace director in Stockton. Like hundreds of other cities, homicides in Stockton have ticked up in past months. In 2020, 55 people were murdered in the city, the highest number in three years. Muhammad believes that ghost guns have played a role, especially among Stockton’s teens. “We’ve seen a younger group of people engaging in gunplay, he said. “There’s no school right now, and a 14, 15 year old isn’t gonna just sit at home if their parents are out working.” The loss of in-person schooling and extracurriculars, have left “ample time to get in disagreement”, he said. “Whatever people can do to make money, they will. And they know there’s a high demand, with people scared at the beginning of the pandemic and buying guns,” said Rudy Corpuz Jr, the executive director of United Playaz, a San Francisco-based violence prevention and youth development organization. “It’s scary because a lot of the ghost guns are in hands that are not responsible. And when you have kids all over in parks and places where violence happens, there’s potential that one of these can be used, and then one of these kids doesn’t get a chance to grow up.” Padilla, the Los Angeles-based violence interrupter, said the casualness with which she’s heard some young people talk about getting a kit sent to their home worried her. She said language barriers and lack of information among parents can make it difficult for them to regulate the packages that are being sent to their homes. “We need to do more education campaigns because some of these parents may get a package they may not think too much about. We need to let them know that they need to keep an eye out because these guns can cause a lot of harm,” she said. Following three mass shootings this spring, including a downtown San Diego shooting where a ghost gun was used, Biden directed the Department of Justice to develop new regulations around ghost guns. On 7 May, the ATF, which is part of the DOJ, proposed new rules that would close the loophole that allows ghost guns to be sold with little oversight. Under the new measures, the primary parts of a gun kit would be considered firearms, and therefore would need a serial number. Buyers would have to pass a background check. The measures would mark the first effort to regulate ghost guns on the federal level. In California, a 2018 state law required at-home kit builders to apply for a unique serial number, but the requirement only applied to ghost gun builders, and not to sellers, leaving it legal to sell kits without a serial number. San Francisco is set to weigh a proposal that would go further, and ban the sale of ghost guns as well. If the ordinance passed, it would make the city the first in California to do so. Meanwhile, several local district attorneys have sued ghost gun manufacturers and a number of states and cities have had lawsuits against the ATF for their original refusal to regulate ghost gun kits like traditional firearms. The Los Angeles city attorney joined Everytown for Gun Safety in a lawsuit against Polymer80, a popular gun kit seller that is facing a number of other lawsuits in California and Washington DC over their advertisement practices. The suit alleges that the dealer acted negligently and failed “to avoid exposing others to reasonably foreseeable risks of injury”, according to the complaint filed in December. Everytown is also suing 1911builders.com, the gun kit maker and dealer who sold the kit that was used in the Saugus school shooting, on behalf of one of the victims. In November 2019, Mia Tretta was injured in a mass shooting at Saugus high school in Santa Clarita. A 16-year-old student at the school had brought a homemade .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol which he used to shoot five students – two fatally – before turning the ghost gun on himself. The entire incident lasted less than 30 seconds. Since the tragedy, in which she lost her close friend Dominic Blackwell, Tretta’s been a vocal gun violence prevention advocate with Students Demand Action, a youth-led organization that lobbies for strengthened gun laws. “In my situation, we still don’t know who bought the gun. We know who used it, but we can’t trace it back,” Tretta said. “I want people to use my story to show what happens when anyone can get a gun.” Community workers such as Corpuz and Muhammad welcome Biden’s efforts, and agree that the spread of ghost guns needs to be stifled. But they also worry that federal action will beget local police crackdowns, a backlash that would lead to more harm among those who are already most at-risk of being shot. Rather than increased patrols and traffic stops, the interventionists say, communities need traditional violence intervention practices that provide social support and healing services. “The devil’s in the details,” said Corpuz of United Playaz. “You can think a new policy is about the ghost guns but then it leads to harassment. We all want ghost guns off of the street but we have to look to see what the fine print is before we support the rules because they can be harsh on Black and brown communities.” Muhammad of Advanced Peace likened the potential danger of increased policing and harsher sentences for having a ghost gun to the crack-cocaine laws of the late 20th century. “Once the laws happen they affect the bottom rung,” Muhammad said. “Police forces all over the country get access to federal dollars for any campaign, but that won’t stop the shooting; it won’t stop the guns from getting into the hands of young people.” This article was amended on 19 May 2021 to remove an incorrect paragraph saying that home-assembled guns cost much less than a traditional gun bought from a licensed store.",2021-05-18 06:00:49,"Ordered online, assembled at home: the deadly toll of California’s ‘ghost guns’","politics and government,law and legislation,armament, defense and military forces,gun control,terrorism,crime and criminals,firearms,children and youth",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Chernykh appeared in U.S. District Court in Riverside, where in January 2017 she pleaded guilty to conspiracy, perjury and two counts of making false statements. The status of Chernykh’s immigration case was unclear Monday; Debbie Cannon, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said her agency does not comment on individual cases. Chernykh’s Russian passport was ordered returned to her after the sentencing.

The Russian citizen previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy; fraud and  visas misuse, permits, and other documents, perjury; and material false statements.

(Photo by Cindy Yamanaka, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG)  “Miss Chernykh made a very, very bad decision based on exceedingly bad advice from her brother-in-law,” David Kaloyanides, her attorney, told Judge Jesus G. Bernal in an attempt to get a lesser sentence. “It was he who orchestrated the scheme.” Syed Raheel Farook, the male attacker’s brother, and Raheel’s wife, Tatiana Farook, who is Chernykh’s sister, had been sentenced to three years of probation. The attorney said Chernykh was on the verge of homelessness with her daughter, who at the time was a year old, and was desperate. Assistant U.S. Attorney Melanie Sartoris disagreed that Chernykh was less culpable. “She engaged in a multi-year conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Immigration Service. She was the central actor,” Sartoris told Bernal. Chernykh declined to make a statement to the court before she was sentenced as Trenna Meins, widow of shooting victim Damian Means, watched from the gallery. Chernykh was not accused of any crime directly related to the Dec. 2, 2015, assault that also wounded 22. Still, Kaloyanides sought to have the courtroom cleared before sentencing, saying that the media had unfairly linked her to the attack. Bernal denied the motion, noting that by law almost all hearings are open to the public. In July 2009, Chernykh and her sister – then Tatiana Gigliotti – came to the U.S. on three-month visas and never left. In 2013, Gigliotti married Syed Raheel Farook, brother of Syed Rizwan Farook who would carry out the 2015 San Bernardino attack alongside his wife, Tashfeen Malik, at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. The radicalized Muslims, residents of Redlands, were killed in a gunfight with police a few hours later. In 2014, Chernykh married Enrique Marquez Jr., who supplied the weapons used in the attack. The marriage was a sham; Marquez was paid $200 a month to go along with it. Related Articles

On Dec. 1, 2015, two days before Chernykh and Marquez had a meeting with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, they created a backdated lease to pretend they lived at the Corona house of Tatiana and Raheel Farook, court documents say. In reality, Chernykh lived in Ontario with her boyfriend, who is the father of her child, while Marquez lived with his parents in Riverside. The marriage allowed Chernykh to apply for permanent residence. The phony couple took other steps to make their marriage appear to be one borne out of love and not convenience. Chernykh and Tatiana Farook purchased a $50 wedding ring for Marquez, Raheel and Tatiana Farook signed the marriage license as witnesses, wedding photos were taken, and the newlyweds opened a joint banking account, according to the indictment.

I had never heard of such a thing until the airing in the 1960s of a new series on television: ""Combat!"" It followed a squad of American soldiers in France during World War II led by Sgt. “Chip” Saunders. He was the one with the machine gun. He blasted Nazis, and mowed them down. He was my hero, so much so that I called myself “Chip,” and better still, I found my own machine gun. In the woods on the property where I grew up there was an old garbage dump used at the turn of the century by the previous owners and years before the town mandated a garbage pick-up system. My sisters, brothers and I enjoyed excavating the dump, finding old bottles, dolls, cans, and once a beautiful, enamel, cream-colored machine gun. It was, in reality, the leg of a kitchen table with a support bracket that looked like a weapon Chip and the men carried through the war they fought every Tuesday night. I lugged my machine gun through the backyard and adjacent woods for weeks, shooting airplanes, squirrels, the neighbor’s beagle, the neighbor hanging her laundry, and my sister at least 15 times a day. I loved the adventure, the victories, the feeling I had when I placed my gun in the garage and ran up the back porch steps on my way to dinner. That summer, my grandparents came to America for a visit from Belgium. It was at this time that my grandmother explained to me how my grandfather volunteered to fight in World War I, and how a German bullet ripped through his left arm, shattered the bone, nerves and cartilage to such an extent that my grandfather lost the use of that arm. I always knew he had a shriveled appendage, always saw how he struggled with the newspaper and the garden tools, but I never knew what happened until that summer and after my grandmother shared the story of my grandfather’s near death experience on the battlefield, and his spending two years in the hospital with countless operations, I dragged the kitchen leg and buried it in the ancient garbage dump. No way to stop it: Gun control is a lost cause. Come despair with me. It is my suspicion that the exposure to violence that we see on television, in the newspapers, in video games, in art, and in the words of pop music all contribute to the mass shootings in the nation these past months and years. According to the American Psychiatric Association, the average American youth will witness 200,000 violent acts on television before the age of 18. We spend over $240 billion dollars in 2019 on advertisements, proving that pounding the image of a product into our minds again and again convinces people to subliminally purchase this brand of beer, or that medication or this automobile or that insurance. Advertisement works. Chip Saunders was my hero, and ""Combat!"" my user’s manual. Perhaps children being exposed to 200,000 violent acts of television before they reach the age of 18 isn’t a good idea. Do we learn violence and its pleasures from our culture, or is this an innate dark side of our nature? Why do people flock to the bullfight arena and watch the abuse of an animal with glee and call it art and tradition? Why do we relish a seat ringside and watch with passion two human beings smash each other in the face until one combatant falls unconscious to the mat with blood oozing from his mouth and nose? John Steinbeck said in his acceptance speech after being awarded the Nobel Prize in literature that the writer “is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.” 2nd Amendment Foundation: Gun control laws don't deter madmen We are a nation dreaming of death and violence, having exhumed my kitchen machine gun and shooting people in the malls, in the offices, on the streets, and in our homes. Why do we have so many guns in our country? How is it possible that it is illegal for an air freshener to block a car mirror, and yet so many millions can enter a store and buy a rifle? Advocates of our national arsenal use the Second Amendment as a justification. But what does the Second Amendment say? ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" The writers of the Constitution didn’t say that a militia and every Tom, Dick and Harry have the right to walk around with a semi-automatic slung over his shoulder. This clearly reads that the people have a right to establish a regulated militia to protect our country from aggression. Despite this common sense reading, the Supreme Court held, 5-4, in the 2008 District of Columbia v. Heller case case that the Second Amendment ""protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home,"" granting this guarantee to the individual person. And yet the country is still not satisfied. People want to carry their guns out into the neighborhood, so the Supreme Court will decide this year if states can prevent people from carrying concealed weapons outside the home for self defense. I don’t think the framers of the Constitution would suggest that there ought to be a .44 Magnum tucked under our belts when we go out for ice-cream or a bazooka, which are heavily regulated but still legal, in the SUV. USA TODAY News: Supreme Court poised to jump into Second Amendment disputes, as nation mourns mass shootings But we are a nation with freedoms. We shun regulation. We want what we want. I loved my machine gun. If someone wants a gun (the thinking goes) that person ought to have the right to own that gun. But we are placing weapons of mass destruction in our hands. Routinely we hear of another mass shooting. Violence is advertised and consumed in our homes daily from police dramas to the nightly news. What do we do? Why don’t we as a nation sit next to James Madison, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and George Washington, and establish gun laws that not only protect us from our enemies, but also protect us from ourselves as well? Christopher de Vinck’s newest book is ""Ashes"" (published by HarperCollins), a novel based on his relatives’ four year experience under Nazi occupation in Belgium.

Ptarmigan is still my favorite silent “p” word. It’s difficult to describe the magic that is being worked in my life by tacos lately. They’re probably the healthiest coping mechanism I’ve found yet. These past fifteen months have given us myriad examples to prove we’re all just sims and the advanced being who’s playing the game has a most twisted sense of humor. Nothing seems real at this point. Reason and logic are out the window. Frequent fodder here at the Briefing during this time has been the bumbling gubernatorial triumvirate of Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and Andrew Cuomo. Make no mistake, I would love to be able to stop writing about them but they just won’t go away. Few people have benefited more from a toxic combination of liberal media bias and the participation trophy era than these three. The fact that they’re all still employed is kind of stunning when you think about it. Back when this country had more backbone, shame would have made each of them tuck tail and resign. We discussed Whitmer recently, and yesterday the other two members of the Idiot Triplets were in the news again. Gavin Newsom decided that science doesn’t need to be followed anymore and is keeping California’s mask mandate in place. The Cuomo news was even more stunning. Bryan wrote about it: Forbes reports a bombshell: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is set to haul in a total of $5 million from the book he wrote while he was supposedly handling the COVID crisis in his state. A cool five million for a book about “Leadership Lessons” from the governor who bungled things so badly that he killed 15,000 or so people. That’s the real galling thing here. Cuomo not only didn’t handle things well, he was actively covering up how poorly he was doing. He has yet to face anything in the way of accountability. Quite the opposite — he’s making bank on his failure. I’m trying to remember the last time that a Democrat was held accountable for any wrongdoing. We have been subjected to over-the-top demagoguery from elected Democrats — including the alleged president — and the so-called “experts” for over a year and it’s nigh on impossible to count how many times they’ve all been wrong. Matt has a post about the most recent and egregious example: In March, Texas Governor Greg Abbott axed the state’s mask mandate and other COVID-related restrictions on businesses and people. Joe Biden blasted the decision, calling the move a “huge mistake” and “Neanderthal thinking.” “The last thing we need is the Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime everything’s fine, take off your mask, forget it. It still matters,” he said. “It’s critical, critical, critical, critical that they follow the science.” Dr. Anthony Fauci also called it “risky” and “potentially dangerous.” “When you pull back on all mitigation methods on all public health guidelines, that’s when you get into trouble and history has proven that,” Fauci told Chris Wallace of Fox News. “This isn’t just some kind of a theoretical, a point that I’m trying to make. It’s not theoretical. It actually happens.” Weeks later, when no surge in cases happened, Fauci tried to suggest that there might be a “lag,” but no surge ever happened. Now, for the first time since the start of the pandemic, Texas has reported zero coronavirus deaths for a day. They also reported the fewest COVID cases in over a year, the lowest seven-day COVID positivity rate ever, and the lowest number of COVID hospitalizations in 11 months. Where does Greg Abbott go for his apology? Or Ron DeSantis? Fauci’s mouth runs like diarrhea from a toddler. There may not be any highly educated person in history who’s said more stupid things in a one-year span than Anthony Fauci. The hacks in the mainstream media never call him out on any of it. He’s still treated like he’s the messiah by the mask fetishists. It’s OK to be sick of these people. They’re horrible and they’re bad at their jobs and they’ve been praised for ruining what was once the greatest country on Earth. Somewhere, someday, they’ll hopefully have to answer for all of this.

          / CBS News Washington — The House approved a bill Tuesday to address the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act passed by a vote of 364 to 62, with all 62 ""no"" votes coming from Republicans. It was overwhelmingly approved last month by the Senate by a vote of 94 to 1. President Biden has previously expressed support for the bill, and is expected to sign it when it comes to his desk. The legislation would direct the Justice Department to expedite the review of hate crime incidents and provide more guidance to state and local entities to make it easier to report hate crimes, as well as expand public education campaigns designed to increase awareness and outreach to victims. The bill, sponsored by Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and New York Congresswoman Grace Meng, was introduced amid a dramatic rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic. The organization Stop AAPI Hate said last month that it had received a total of 6,603 reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders between March 19, 2020, and March 31, 2021. The vote on Tuesday also comes two months after a mass shooting in March that killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent, in the Atlanta area. The bill garnered support from Senate Republicans after a round of negotiations last month. The Senate-passed legislation removed sections tying hate crimes to COVID-19, after Republicans argued that the initial bill's focus was too narrow. The bill also allows the attorney general to issue grants to state and local governments to assist them with reporting hate crimes. ""Those of Asian descent have been blamed and scapegoated for the outbreak of COVID-19,"" Meng told reporters in a press conference ahead of the vote on Tuesday. ""And as a result, Asian Americans have been beaten, slashed, spat on, and even set on fire and killed. The Asian American community is exhausted from being forced to endure this rise in bigotry and racist attacks. Asian Americans are tired of living in fear.""

380,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/652664916/0/phoenix/nation~Hate-crimes-bill-to-fight-Asian-American-discrimination-gets-final-House-vote-Tuesday/,"WASHINGTON – For more than a year, reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans have drastically climbed. Legislation meant to combat the attacks and racism is headed to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature after passing a final vote in the House – a win for advocates and the Asian Americans and Pacific Islander community. The House passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, 364-62, which would expedite the Justice Department's review of hate crimes and designate an official at the department to oversee the effort. More: Suspect in Atlanta-area spa killings indicted on murder, domestic terror charges, could face hate crimes Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a news conference Tuesday that ""after a year in which we've seen 6,600 reported anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents and after a year of the Asian American community crying out for help, today, Congress is taking historic action to pass long-overdue hate crimes legislation."" ""These incidents have terrified the Asian American community,"" she said. After a mass shooting in Georgia in March that killed eight people – six of whom were women of Asian descent – lawmakers in both chambers of Congress called for quick action on the legislation. May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. The bill passed the Senate in April by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 94-1, becoming one of the few pieces of legislation to be negotiated and pass the gridlocked upper chamber. More: COVID-19 hate crimes bill to fight Asian American discrimination passes Senate ""The vote today on the Anti-Asian hate crimes bill is proof that when the Senate is given the opportunity to work, the Senate can work to solve important issues,"" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said from the Senate floor before that vote. The last piece of hate crime legislation to be signed into law was the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded the law to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation, gender identity and more. President Barack Obama signed the measure in 2009 as a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act. Violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander  communities has grown despite increased national attention and political action against anti-Asian hate. The uptick in anti-Asian violence was first reported in March 2020 as COVID-19 began spreading, and some politicians, including President Donald Trump, blamed China for the pandemic. Opinion:Asian and Pacific Islander heritage helps lift America to what it must be There was a more than 164% increase in anti-Asian hate crime reports to police in the first quarter of 2021 in 16 major cities and jurisdictions compared with last year, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. More than 6,600 hate incidents have been reported in the year since the pandemic began in the USA, Stop AAPI Hate announced this week. More than a third of those incidents were reported this March, according to the organization founded last year in response to increased targeting of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during the pandemic. In New York this week, a woman was arrested after being seen on surveillance video attacking two Asian women because they were wearing masks, striking one with a hammer. 'A historic surge': Anti-Asian American hate incidents skyrocket despite public awareness campaign Tuesday's House vote fell on the third annual National Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Day Against Bullying and Hate, which coincides with the birthday of Vincent Chin, who was murdered in 1982 in a hate crime. Chin was a Chinese American man in Detroit killed by two autoworkers who thought he was Japanese, whom they blamed for the industry's struggles. His killers paid a $3,000 fine each and went free. Though the hate crimes legislation got broad bipartisan support in the Senate and widespread support in the House, it faced some Republican resistance. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said from the House floor Tuesday that his GOP colleagues took issue with provisions in the bill such as the ""ambiguous hotlines for people to report anything they find troubling."" Helen Zia has seen hostility against Asian Americans before: ‘We didn’t learn enough or some people have forgotten.’ Biden supports the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. He said in March, “It’s time for Congress to codify and expand upon these actions – because every person in our nation deserves to live their lives with safety, dignity and respect."" White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Tuesday that Biden would sign the legislation into law this week. @potus was pleased to see the House pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. He looks forward to signing this important legislation into law at the White House later this week. For some AAPI members of Congress, the legislation is a good start to combat some of these crimes, but advocacy and support from other communities is necessary. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., author of the legislation, released a video in September that played several racist voicemails her office received. Last week my resolution condemning anti-Asian sentiment passed the House.After that, I got many racist voicemails saying the very things we collectively condemned.164 Republicans voted against #HRes908 & couldn’t condemn this hate. Words & actions have consequences. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/lCFgVb8zoo Some of the messages referred to the ""kung flu,"" an offensive and derogatory term used to describe COVID-19. ""During COVID-19 we have witnessed unspeakable acts of violence – even death – against our community. It breaks my heart to see such hateful incidents. But I believe this moment in American history has planted new seeds of friendship and allyship,"" Meng said in a statement Tuesday. ""Let us go forward in solidarity within our community and lock arms with other communities."" Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., rose in support of the ""Senate-amended, bipartisan"" legislation Tuesday, saying hate crimes are ""not reflective of the country that welcomed me and my family into its fabric."" ""That's why I'm glad Congress is coming together in a bipartisan way to take steps against the hate targeting communities like the AAPI community,"" she said. ""However, let's recognize that we cannot legislate hate out of our people's hearts and minds. We must treat each other with respect and see each other as Americans."" Rep. Young Kim: Bipartisan stand needed against hate crimes that target Asian Americans Chu, who was born in the USA, told USA TODAY in March that “like many Asian Americans,” she has received “comments like ‘where are you from?’” Those questions make her feel ""seen as a foreigner in my own land."" The text of the No Hate Act, legislation co-sponsored by Chu that is included in the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, would enact a more informed approach to prevention by providing grants to states to improve hate crime reporting. That provision would allow courts to require people convicted under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act to take part in community service and educational programs as a condition of supervised release. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., called the data around increased anti-Asian hate ""both humbling and frightening."" ""Everyone deserves to live without fear of violence against themselves and their families. And our country needs a way forward past this era of violence and hate. The swift passage and implementation of the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act will prove crucial to this endeavor,"" he said during Tuesday's news conference. Contributing: N'dea Yancey-Bragg, Ryan W.

The photographer Wendy Huynh, whose parents are Chinese immigrants from Vietnam who moved to France to flee communism, has experienced racism in Paris and London. She created a series of portraits celebrating Asian women in London from the creative industry to tackle the issue, and the Guardian talked to some of them about their experiences Last modified on Wed 19 May 2021 14.07 BST For Bonnie Kwok it was a subtle difference. Whenever she used public transport there was always a space left next to her. At first she dismissed it, but when it started to happen regularly she began to question why other passengers were reluctant to take the free seat. Kwok, 43, who was born in Hong Kong but moved to the UK when she was 16, also started to notice children at the Hackney Chinese community school, where she is a headteacher, were increasingly coming in upset. They were, she says, being subjected to racist abuse on their way to school – something that started to happen with concerning regularity during the onset of the pandemic.  Mrs Helen Fung, honorary chair of Community Cohesion Advocates CIC, governor of London Hackney Chinese community school and Dr Bonnie Kwok (right), headteacher of London Hackney Chinese community school, East Croydon. “There is no other way of explaining it – we were being shunned and abused because we were being blamed for spreading coronavirus,” she said. “Things definitely got worse with Covid: someone told one of our students to ‘go back to your country, we don’t want you here , you are a virus’ – the student was really upset. She couldn’t understand why she had been singled out.” The experience described by Kwok and her students is part of a worrying trend. Over the past year there has been a significant rise in hate crime against people of east Asian appearance. In May 2020, ministers told MPs that hate crime directed at south and east Asian communities had increased by 21% during the coronavirus crisis, with police estimates suggesting a threefold increase in such incidents in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. Incidents include individuals being spat on and assaulted, with an unprovoked attack on a 26-year-old woman in Edinburgh, the beating of a university lecturer out jogging in Southampton and a physical assault on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok on Oxford Street in London. For Songsoo Kim, a South Korean cook who has been living in the UK for more than three years, there had always been a level of microaggressive behaviour towards her, as well as overt racial slurs, including being called “ching chong”, but there was a distinct change during the pandemic. Yeon You, fashion stylist, Hackney Central. Right: Songsoo Kim, cook, Shoreditch. The 33-year-old, who lives in London, said one of her regular customers questioned whether she was still OK to work, with another making racially loaded comments about her mask. “I think Covid has definitely brought about certain incidences and these kind of strange suspicions of east Asian people,” she said. “At first it was quite confusing – like: why am I being asked if I should be working still? – and then you realise what the meaning is and it hurts.” Maya (make-up artist), Vic (sport massage), Josie (singer) and Alexandra Man (personal trainer), St Mary Cray. But Kim says UK-based east Asians have suffered racism for many years, and due to a culture of quietly ignoring inappropriate comments and staying silent, the abuse had slipped under the radar. “It is not something new for me and others, but our parents’ generation did not want to talk about it – it’s a deeply rooted cultural thing where there is a sense of shame in discussing it,” she said. “It’s also rooted in the fact that there is a facade of this model minority, of excelling, and so you kind of shut your mouth, don’t complain and keep going.” Jyni Ong, writer at It’s Nice That, Cricklewood. Right: Maria Yeung, founder of Marieyat, Dalston. However, movements to end violence and racism against east Asian people have begun to gain traction globally. In the US there have been dozens of rallies against anti-Asian hate across the country, viral social media campaigns spreading awareness of the issue and more than $25m in donations to groups supporting Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) causes. This comes after two high-profile, violent incidents in January against elderly Asian men, one of whom died from his injuries, and the murder of six Asian American women in a mass shooting in Atlanta. In the UK, celebrities have united to back a #StopAsianHate campaign with Marvel film stars Gemma Chan and Benedict Wong among prominent east and south-east Asian people taking action on the country’s wave of Covid-related sinophobia. Jenny Cheng, AKA Stem, DJ, High Barnet. Right: Candice Lo, film-maker, Dalston. The photographer Wendy Huynh, who grew up in the suburbs of Paris, raised by Chinese parents who immigrated to France in the early 1970s from Vietnam, says she created this series of portraits to try to encourage open dialogue about east Asian racism. “Racism has been a constant thing for me and my family in France and this has followed me in the UK with people shouting ‘Ni Hao’ or ‘Ching Chong’ to me and making the slitty eyes,” she said. “Every time this happens I would just ignore it but in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and people being more vocal about racism I have opened my eyes on the issue,” she added. The 28-year-old said the pandemic became an excuse for people to be actively racist towards the east Asian community. “It was the start of the pandemic last year and I was in a pharmacy when a woman shouted at me: ‘You people come here and bring your virus! Go back to your country! We don’t want your virus here’. I was so shocked that I didn’t immediately understand that she was talking to me,” she said. “The east Asian community is one which doesn’t like to speak up or is afraid to. Parents would tell their kids to keep their heads down and just keep working hard in order to be accepted by our current society,” she said. “But our parents have risked their lives migrating to a western country to create a better life for their family and I feel like it is our turn today to tell the story of our immigrant parents, to embrace our culture and to speak up in order to fight racism.” Rahel Stephanie, founder and chef at Spoons, Brockley. Tianna Chan, head of operations at Rekki, Deptford. Natalie Chui, an amateur footballer, agrees with Huyhn about the importance of discussing racism openly. The 24-year-old was physically attacked in 2017 and says she has only recently been able to talk about the assault. “I was at the bus stop in the morning and I saw this figure walk towards me, and without me kind of realising it, all of a sudden he was right in my face calling me a ‘dirty Vietnamese’. I have never been so aggressively attacked like that – there was a lot of rage – and then he hit me in the head,” said Chui, who is dual Malaysian Chinese heritage. Nicole and Natalie Chui, football players from the Victoria Park Vixens, Homerton. The attacker was arrested immediately by a passing police car and after a trial was found guilty of a racially aggravated assault and given a custodial sentence, but Chui says she still thinks about the attack often. “At the time I just tried to move on from it quickly. It was so intense I blocked it out. I had spent most of my life living in Hong Kong, where I was the majority, and then all of a sudden to be attacked because of my race it was a real shock. I felt like an alien,” she said. But Chui, who plays football for the Victoria Park Vixens team with her sister, Nicole, 25, says many in the east Asian community are feeling mobilised for the first time ever to tackle the issue. “The Black Lives Matter protests really helped: it allowed us to reflect on what was happening in our communities, and we have bonded together and started to talk about these difficult things we have been experiencing,” she said. “It’s shocking and it’s sad and we would like for it to stop.” Sarah, Sami and Roxy, founders at Baesianz, Loughborough Junction.",2021-05-19 01:00:19,Confronting hate against east Asians – a photo essay,education and schools,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

But that pause was temporary. As the country has embraced the renewed freedoms offered by vaccination, there has been a rash of high-profile mass shootings. They have happened in Indianapolis, Boulder, Atlanta — and here close to home at the Oneida Oneida Casino/Radisson Hotel & Conference Center in Ashwaubenon. These tragic acts represent only a few of the more than 190 shootings in which four or more individuals were either injured or murdered since Jan. 1. What one doesn’t see in the news are the tragedies that continued on an individual basis. There were more deaths from gun violence in 2020 than in 2019. RELATED: Oneida Casino shooting: Three killed, including gunman; one person seriously injured near Green Bay According to FBI data, close to 40 million firearms were purchased in 2020. This is almost 10 million more than were purchased in 2019. An increase in the number of deaths from gun violence also increased, according to the Gun Violence Archive, from just under 40,000 deaths in 2019 to over 43,500 in 2020. These include any casualty related to a gun, which includes mass shootings, suicides, and other incidents. What can be done to help prevent this violence? Congress must take action. On April 7, President Joe Biden addressed the nation about the gun violence epidemic, calling it an “international embarrassment.” Biden vowed to take six actions, including preventing the purchases of “ghost guns,” legislation for states to use on “red flag” laws and working with communities. This is a start, but we need bipartisan action from Congress. Recently, two pieces of federal legislation have passed the House of Representatives and are awaiting action in the Senate: the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, (H.R. 8) and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 (H.R. 1446). The bills represent small, yet effective steps that can be taken to reduce deaths from gun violence. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act would require a background check for individuals buying a gun through alternative methods, such as online or at gun shows. The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021 would lengthen the time the FBI has to conduct a background check to 10 days. These ideas have the support of Americans. A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University, indicated that 89% of Americans support background checks. The bills would help ensure that the rights of responsible gun owners remain intact, keeping the foundation for the Second Amendment and ensuring that law-abiding citizens maintain their legal gun ownership. For example, the language in the Bipartisan Background Checks Act is clear: Your grandchildren can still inherit your gun collection, or you can still have your gun in your home for protection.  Rather, these bills are focused on those who are an imminent danger to themselves or others. The Fox Cities community has been hit hard by the lack of regulations for purchasing guns online. One example is the loss of Sara Schmidt in 2018. Even though her spouse was charged with felony domestic violence charges, he was able to purchase a gun. He later murdered her and committed suicide. The Post-Crescent reports that in 2018, she was one of four women murdered in firearm-involved domestic violence. The mass shooting in Atlanta targeted women of Asian descent and the workplace shooting in Indianapolis murdered members of the Sikh community. How many more communities will be affected? These bills have a potential to reduce the many deaths and injuries that occur from gun violence. Removing the ability to buy a gun without a background check and providing the proper amount of time to conduct a background check can help prevent violence. What if the pause in mass shootings had marked the end of mass shootings? As gun safety measures are considered in the U.S. Senate, please join me and ask your senators to vote “yes” on these common-sense approaches to keep communities safe. Sen.

385,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/qanon-shaman-s-lawyer-blames-autism-his-client-s-jan-ncna1267920," Follow think More from NBC © 2021 NBCNEWS.COM Autistic people advocating on their own behalf in recent years have been pushing society to accept the idea of neurodiversity, which argues that autism (and other neuroatypical conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia and more) are not problems that need to be cured as much as they are different permutations of humanity and, therefore, people with these conditions deserve to be treated as equal citizens. But demanding the right to equal treatment comes with the equal social responsibilities as one’s neurotypical counterparts. Autism and other neuroatypical conditions are not and cannot be literal “get out of jail free” cards and cannot and should not absolve neuroatypical people of their worst actions. But in part because of the persistent myths about autism and the social stigmas that have been attached to people with the disorder, it’s become an increasingly convenient scapegoat for people’s harmful actions. His excuses for his client are just the latest example of people using autism to excuse someone’s bad behavior, no matter how unrelated it may be to their actions. For instance, Albert Watkins, the lawyer for Jacob Chansley, the self-described QAnon shaman who is facing charges for his role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, is now saying that his client’s supposed Asperger’s syndrome should play a factor in the disposition of his case. “A lot of these defendants — and I’m going to use this colloquial term, perhaps disrespectfully — but they’re all f------ short-bus people,” Watkins told Talking Points Memo. “These are people with brain damage, they’re f------ retarded, they’re on the goddamn spectrum."" Setting aside Watkins’ bigoted and ableist language that was also outdated —Asperger’s syndrome, along with other autism permutations, was folded into the umbrella term of autism spectrum disorder in 2013 — his excuses for his client are just the latest example of people using autism to excuse someone’s bad behavior, no matter how unrelated it may be to their actions. But using autism as an excuse only further stigmatizes autistic people and makes neurotypical people associate the condition with violence and antisocial behavior. Of course, blaming autism for the harmful actions of entitled men is not unprecedented in our society, which is one reason why stigmas around autism persist. What these lawyers hope will liberate their clients adds to the stigma that essentially imprisons other autistic people who do not conduct themselves in ways requiring legal representation. For example, after it was revealed that Adam Lanza, who committed the horrific mass shooting in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., was autistic, calls to the advocacy group Autism Speaks spiked 130 percent. (Many autistic people and autistic-led organizations criticize the group for its lack of autistic people in leadership and its focus on finding a cure as part of its mission until 2016.) Similarly, after rumors spread that the mass shooter at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015 might be autistic, a Facebook page called “Families Against Autistic Shooters” briefly sprang up, before it was eventually removed. The shooter's mother told The Los Angeles Times in 2017 that he had been diagnosed with Asperger’s later in life and had been medicated for unspecified mental health conditions but stopped taking his pills, while his manifesto released that year suggested he had been treated for bipolar disorder. But neurotypical people blaming autism for violent people’s actions is only part of the stigma-reinforcing cycle; people with autism who commit violent acts have also blamed their disorder — or, at least, allowed their lawyers to try to take advantage of the stigma, as in Capitol rioter Chansley’s case. Using autism as an excuse only further stigmatizes autistic people and makes neurotypical people associate the condition with violence and antisocial behavior. Take Alek Minassian, who killed 10 people with a van in Toronto in 2018: He pleaded not guilty on the grounds that his autism meant he could not be held criminally responsible. (The judge rejected his defense and found him guilty in March.) Similarly, lawyers for Jason Berlin, who was convicted of raping a woman in San Diego in 2013, argued during an attempt to withdraw his guilty plea that because Berlin was autistic, he didn’t know that what he was doing was wrong. (Berlin’s sentence was reduced from eight to six years as a result of the hearing, though the judge did not credit the autism testimony.) And lawyers for Dylann Roof — the racist shooter who killed nine people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 — initially planned on arguing during his death penalty hearings that Roof had, among other conditions, autism as way of arguing that he should receive life in prison instead. Roof told a judge, “If the price is that people think I'm autistic, then it's not worth it,” and said that being labeled as such “discredits the reason why I did the crime.” (Incidentally, Hans Asperger, the researcher for whom the syndrome is named, conducted his research in Nazi-occupied Austria, and referred or transferred children to a clinic in Vienna where children were experimented on or killed; autism would naturally diminish one’s standing as a member of the master race among the modern neo-Nazis Roof idolized.) Autism is never the sole reason people commit bad acts — or good ones. As someone who is autistic — and having spent the last few years researching and writing a book about autism — I can say that these rationales are unequivocally (to quote the president) a bunch of malarkey. While it is true that autism makes social interactions difficult — in particular, it often makes it difficult to read other people’s nonverbal cues, on which so much of our social understandings are predicated — having some difficulties with social interactions is not in and of itself an incubator or predictor of violence toward others. There are plenty of autistic people who have never gotten involved in a violent insurrection against our democracy; there are lots of autistic people who have never committed a mass murder; and there are many autistic people who have trouble dating who have never raped anyone. As autistic writer Zack Budryk (a former colleague) has written, plenty of autistic people have a strong sense of right and wrong, which governs the way we live our lives; being autistic doesn’t mean you don’t know the difference. Saying that autism is why Chansley — or any of a myriad of other bad actors — committed terrible actions on Jan. 6 essentially argues that autism alone makes them (and any of us) prone to acts of aggression and therefore we are unprepared or unfit for democracy. But what these lawyers hope will be a means of liberating their clients adds to the stigma that essentially imprisons other autistic people who do not conduct themselves in a manner requiring legal representation before a criminal court. This is not to say that autistic people can’t do terrible things or that autistic people can’t be vulnerable to the same kind of online right-wing radicalization that affects our neurotypical counterparts. (There were, after all, plenty of neurotypical people who occupy the highest echelons of society among the rioters on the Hill on Jan 6.) Autistic people can as easily express bigoted views or be committed to social equality as neurotypical people. Autism is never the sole reason people commit bad acts — or good ones — and one autistic person’s actions aren’t characteristic of the entire gamut of autistic people. We are just people — sometimes good, sometimes bad, and sometimes a combination of both. One would think neurotypical people, who claim to have superior powers of perception in personal interactions, would be able to see that more clearly than we do.

The House overwhelmingly passed the bill Tuesday, which sent it to Biden's desk. As reports of hate incidents against Asian Americans have drastically climbed for more than a year, the legislation is meant to combat the attacks and racism. After a mass shooting in Georgia in March that killed eight people – six of whom were women of Asian descent – lawmakers in both chambers of Congress called for quick action on the legislation which will become law in May, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast: Israel unleashed a wave of airstrikes across the Gaza Strip early Thursday, killing at least one Palestinian and wounding several others. The strikes came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against U.S. pressure to wind down the offensive against Gaza's militant Hamas rulers, who have fired thousands of rockets at Israel. Israel's Foreign Ministry says ministers from Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia will arrive in the country Thursday ""to express their solidarity and support"" for Israel during its campaign against Hamas. Israel faces mounting international pressure to de-escalate hostilities after 10 days of heavy fighting in Gaza. President Joe Biden, in his most forceful statement yet on the conflict, told Netanyahu on Wednesday that he expects ""a significant de-escalation today on the path to a cease-fire,"" the White House said. Netanyahu, however, said he was ""determined to continue this operation until its aim is met."" Thursday is Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which promotes digital access and inclusion for people living with disabilities. To mark the day, Apple will roll out SignTime, which lets customers communicate with AppleCare and other retail services by using American Sign Language in the United States, British Sign Language in the United Kingdom, and French Sign Language in France through a web browser. Customers visiting Apple Stores in those countries can also use SignTime to remotely access a sign language interpreter without booking one ahead of time. It's one of several new accessibility features on the way for Apple's iPhones, Apple Watches and iPads. A judge in Los Angeles will determine whether there is enough evidence for ""That '70s Show"" and ""The Ranch"" star Danny Masterson to stand trial accused of raping three women in the early 2000s.  Graphic testimony at a preliminary hearing Wednesday saw a woman identified in court only as Christina B., who was five years into a relationship with Masterson, say she awoke one night to find he was raping her. On Tuesday, a different woman identifying herself only as Jen B., testified that she was slipping in and out of consciousness when she found Masterson raping her. ""The first thing I recall is grabbing his hair to pull him off,"" she said. Masterson, 45, has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer, Thomas Mesereau, has said he would prove his client's innocence. The 103rd PGA Championship begins Thursday from Kiawah Island Golf Resort's Ocean Course in South Carolina. Collin Morikawa won last year's event, which was played in August due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He will open the tournament alongside 2021 Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama and 2020 U.S. Open winner Bryson DeChambeau. Tiger Woods, golf's most recognizable player, is still recovering from injuries sustained in a car accident and will not play.

The NFL Network producer paused and pondered while working in December on a particular installment of the “Say Their Stories” series, which involved delicately conveying the significance of Sharonda Coleman-Singleton — one of nine lives lost in a June 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Stark-Jones was touched as she looked through images Coleman-Singleton's family had submitted for the four-minute video. ""There’s a photo of her, sitting at a restaurant,” Stark-Jones recalled during an interview with USA TODAY Sports. Coleman-Singleton, who was 45 when she was killed during a Bible study session, was captured in the picture wearing a striped dress, a broad smile complementing her short-cropped hair. “It reminded me of my mother. JALEN HURTS: I'm 'not above' competing for Eagles' starting QB job BUCS: Share their blueprint on how women can reach the NFL as coaches ""When I was younger, she had a haircut like that. She looked like her. I just remember seeing that photo and I connected to her. I think that’s why, as Black people, we feel hurt by all of this, because we see ourselves and we see our loved ones in these victims.” Coleman-Singleton’s story, narrated by Texans receiver Randall Cobb, was among the 20 documentary-styled PSAs the league-owned media operation produced and distributed on its network and website, and during nationally televised games, under the umbrella of its “Inspire Change” initiative. The purpose was to unapologetically humanize the overwhelmingly Black victims of racial violence, police brutality, social injustice or a combination of any and all such factors, while hopefully enlightening and changing attitudes. Several NFL players, including Saints running back Alvin Kamara, Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu and Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield, served as narrators on the project. They told the stories of people that include some who became household names because of, sadly, the heinous circumstances attached to their deaths: George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. Ahmaud Arbery. Emmett Till. “Oftentimes when I watch the news and hear about these senseless murders and acts of violence, we hear somewhat of a skewed perception of who they were, or giving some type of excuse as to why what happened to them happened — they resisted or didn’t take directions or whatever, and a negative perception of these humans is painted,” said Stark-Jones, who has worked for the NFL since 2011. “With this series, I personally really wanted to make sure that we were able to tell the stories of who they were — they were parents, children, ER nurses — and to let people understand that they are human beings and not just another statistic.” As the first anniversary of Floyd’s death approaches — former police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd’s neck on a Minneapolis street, was found guilty of murder last month — let’s not overlook the perspective of storytellers like Stark-Jones. As a Black woman, she said she felt more a sense of duty than burden in working on a project so different from the typical assignments. The stories forced her into an emotionally charged space. It was personal. It allowed a deeper sense of purpose, awareness and growth. “They’re very tough,” she said. “I think I was definitely hyper-sensitive to a lot of things all season because of the subject matter I was intimately working with. But I wouldn’t have had it any other way. I’ve been so proud to work on these stories."" Stark-Jones wrote and produced about half of the PSAs, tapped by senior producer Anthony Smith to essentially split the heavy lifting with fellow producer Quincy Young. The completed package, which ran during the course of the 2020 season and for several weeks in 2021, was one of the most ambitious and undoubtedly the most socially woke series ever produced by the media arm that often makes its mark with cinematic elegance in documenting the game or other significant moments in NFL history. Included in the widespread acclaim, the series was nominated for an NAACP Image Award and a Webby Award. It’s what Kamara had in mind when he urged the league to do more to commemorate the lives lost than merely allowing players to wear decals featuring the names of victims. “He didn’t want empty symbols,” Smith said of Kamara. That inspired Smith — whose parents used to quiz him with Black History flash cards during his formative years — to brainstorm with others and formulate the structure of the pieces. He settled on simple backgrounds to support the intimate narrations, with each piece ending with the identical “say their name” closing remark. When Smith went back to Kamara, the running back got on board and recruited other players to participate. Kamara narrated the first video, paying homage to Arbery, who was killed in February 2020 while jogging in southern Georgia. “He really set the tone for everything that came after that,” Smith told USA TODAY Sports. “I think having him and Tyrann — players of that caliber — as our first two (narrators) helped us book the additional players for the rest of the series.” Like any producer, Stark-Jones fretted about the nuts-and-bolts challenges, which included a tight timeline and the perils of operating during a pandemic. She wondered whether the narrations, conducted over Zoom  from her Los Angeles home, would be intimate enough for stories with such enormous gravity. Those fears where quickly alleviated. “I was nervous,” she recalled. “ ‘How am I going to get this personal connection with players when we’re talking about something so serious?’ I wanted to be in the room (with them) for this. After doing a few of these, I was like, 'These players are just so passionate about it and care so much.’ ""It was heart-warming to know how invested they were ... and how much they knew about (the victims) without having to prompt them. They didn’t just put a name on the helmet because they thought it was the trendy thing to do, because someone told them to. They did it because it meant something to them.” Stark-Jones couldn’t help but become emotionally attached to the victims whose stories she told. That explains what she described as her “biggest breakdown,” which occurred in real time as she was in the final editing phase for the PSA about Taylor, the 26-year-old EMT who was shot and killed in March 2020 by police who raided her apartment in Louisville in the middle of the night. Coincidentally, the story on Taylor was scheduled to air the week that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced he would not press charges against the officers responsible for her death (a state grand jury merely indicted one of the officers with three counts of “wanton endangerment” for endangering Taylor’s neighbors with the shots). It sparked protests and illustrated yet another case of police not being held accountable for the death of a Black person. “Hearing that there wasn’t going to be any justice served to her was so heart-breaking,” Stark-Jones reflected. The PSA included a comment from the narrator, Cardinals tackle Kelvin Beachum, stating that no one was charged for Taylor’s death. What's next? Officially, the “Say Their Stories” campaign has been completed, with the powers-that-be still determining what form or fashion they will continue with social justice stories as part of their Inspire Change initiative. Stark-Jones, though, would be the first to maintain the work isn’t over when it comes to illuminating the plight of people victimized by social injustice and systemic racism. Nor should it be. “I hope people didn’t see what happened over the summer (of 2020) as just a moment, as something temporary,” she said. “It’s important that we share these types of stories and understand people’s pain and why we’re hurting as a Black community and not just see it as a trend."" The NFL can demonstrate social leadership for corporate America at large by investing resources for projects such as “Say Their Stories,” which speak to the concerns of many of its players and undoubtedly a significant portion of the fan base. Sure, people can consume the games and the NFL can hawk its content and merchandise while growing revenues, but a greater purpose exists. Go ahead. Honor the legacies. Say their names and tell their stories.

She thought about Floyd calling out to his mother as former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes. “What is something that I can do to make me feel like I have a bit of agency?” Brown, an associate professor of political science at Purdue University, asked herself. “What can I do for my girls?” Brown’s answer came in the form of a public syllabus, called the #BlackLivesMatter PGI Syllabus. A year later, Brown still gets emails from teachers, librarians and policymakers who use the guide she created. Public syllabuses often start out as loose lists of resources shared through social media and organized into online guides. As tragedies, from the pandemic to shootings, have shaken the nation and left teachers scrambling to help students make sense of them, public syllabuses have offered a starting point to contextualize current events. Experts say public syllabuses have allowed scholars of color to lead the way in academic spaces that have long excluded them and to explore issues affecting their own communities. But while the months of worldwide protests following Floyd’s murder has been a catalyst for new guides, the public syllabus model is far from new. Among these syllabuses is Justice in June, created by two friends, Autumn Gupta and Bryanna Wallace, following Floyd’s murder. Justice in June is meant to help people incorporate racial justice education into their daily schedules in 10, 25 and 45-minute chunks. “I realized I have some work I can do on my own of learning and setting my foundation,” said Gupta, a 24-year-old middle school science teacher in Smithville, Missouri. “And I thought I could bring people along with me.” In the first week alone, the syllabus had over 1.1 million Twitter impressions and 200,000 users at a time. “Since George Floyd, people are feeling powerless and wanting to know how we got to this point,” Brown said. “Public syllabi are giving them those answers.” Teaching kids to hate America? Republicans want ‘critical race theory’ out of schools Before Justice in June, the list of public syllabuses was long. There are syllabuses on prison abolition and welfare reform. There's a Tulsa syllabus centering the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, and even the Lemonade Syllabus on Beyoncé’s work. Most recently, syllabuses are in the works on the March mass shooting at three Atlanta spas that left eight people, including six Asian women, dead. Many scholars cite historian Marcia Chatelain’s Ferguson Syllabus as the model for crowdsourced public syllabuses. When the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown, a Black teen, sparked protests in Ferguson, Missouri, Chatelain, a history and African American studies professor at Georgetown University, realized she could use Twitter to strategize with other scholars on how to help teachers frame conversations. A year later, the Charleston church massacre left nine Black churchgoers dead at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Chad Williams, chair of the African American Studies Department at Brandeis University, and scholars Keisha Blain and Kidada Williams thought back to Chatelain's work. Williams wanted to start a more historically informed conversation because media coverage often treated the shooting as an isolated incident, rather than part of a larger history of racial violence. So he turned to Twitter. Nine days after the shooting, #CharlestonSyllabus was trending on Twitter, with thousands using the hashtag. The African American Intellectual History Society published a cohesive version of the syllabus, and it was published as a book called “Charleston Syllabus: Readings on Race, Racism, Racial Violence.” “It just took off like wildfire,” Williams said. “It really started as a frustrated tweet, and it turned into something much bigger.” While the Ferguson Syllabus is often cited as the first of its kind, Chatelain said,  “crowdsourcing as a practice and tool for education isn’t new.” Instead, this type of public education outside formal classrooms has deep roots in communities of color, especially in Black intellectual tradition, scholars say. This public education came in the form of pamphlets, speaker series and even protests in civil rights and other movements. “In some ways, public syllabi are an extension of that work,” Chatelain said. “They carry forward some of that spirit of a political pamphlet.” Chatelain said scholars of color have turned to this public education because most classrooms long ignored their experiences and because they see their work as tied to the activism in their communities. ""It's a critical tradition of scholars of color,"" Chatelain said. ""And it's because we know the cost of staying silent."" In addition to crowdsourcing, one factor that makes public syllabuses distinct is that they're open access, unlike most syllabi used in college classrooms. “This open access made the public syllabus much more democratic and detethered the syllabus from its very narrow and even elitist academic roots,” Williams said. “It wasn't just college students or the educated elite who would have access. ... These were resources that were created by the public and for the public.” The controversy over the Trump Syllabus, created by the Chronicle of Higher Education, shows the benefit of crowdsourcing, said Laura Ciolkowski, creator of the Rape Culture Syllabus. The initial syllabus was criticized for its lack of diverse voices, so two historians of color independently created a new crowdsourced public syllabus called Trump Syllabus 2.0. Through crowdsourcing, Ciolkowski said Trump Syllabus 2.0 was able to include work by scholars from a range of backgrounds. “As many people as you can invite into the conversation, the better,” Ciolkowski said. When creating public syllabuses ,scholars not only engage with the public but also with activists on the frontlines of movements. As activists gathered in 2016 to protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, Jaskiran Dhillon, an associate professor of global studies and anthropology at the New School, helped create the Standing Rock Syllabus. Dhillon worked closely with Lakota and Dakota historians. Afterward, they sent copies of the syllabus to front-line resistance camps and to a school organized by water protectors. “It wasn't developed in isolation from the frontline water and land defense movement,” she said. “It was developed in sync with the movement. That’s something you don’t usually get in a typical syllabus.” Dhillon said this community-centered approach allows scholars to raise public awareness in a way that makes people more invested. But public syllabuses also have a place in formal college classrooms, said Hilary Green, an associate professor history at University of Alabama who has used the Charleston Syllabus in her introductory classes since the 2015 shooting. In one of her graduate-level courses, Green had her students create their own crowdsourced public syllabuses to contextualize the 2016 film “Birth of a Nation.” Years later, she still receives emails from teachers and homeschool parents wanting to use the syllabus. “My students saw themselves in this immediate conversation and as part of a larger project that they were crowdsourcing,” she said. “They felt that they were part of a movement.” Derek Chauvin's trial is a teachable moment. How classrooms are discussing it. Many scholars of color say public syllabuses are freeing, allowing them to work beyond the limitations of universities or the so-called ivory tower. Of all full-time faculty at U.S. degree-granting postsecondary institutions in fall 2018, 75% were white, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. A 2019 study from the Hispanic Journal of Law and Policy found that there had been little growth in numbers of faculty members of color at U.S. colleges and universities between 2013 and 2017. Williams said public syllabuses have offered a way to build community with other scholars of color and to feel less alone. “The university and academia has historically not been a welcoming place for scholars of color. Oftentimes, it's a very hostile space,” Williams said. “So there's always been a need to create alternate forms of community for scholars of color.” Brown said the syllabuses expose the limitations of universities, where she said race and gender are often seen as an afterthought. Crowdsourced syllabuses, however, “highlight work that is often marginalized by the mainstream,” and center the voices of marginalized communities, she said. “It gives agency and voice to scholars who are made to feel like they don't matter or that their scholarship doesn't matter,” she said. “This is a way for us to counter, to move outside of the institution, to be able to do this work on our own terms.” Contact News Now Reporter Christine Fernando at cfernando@usatoday.com or follow her on Twitter at @christinetfern.

Plus, you'll hear about the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which President Biden will sign into law today, and the mounting calls for a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza. Hit play on the podcast player above and read along with the transcript below. Taylor Wilson: Good morning, I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things You Need to Know, Thursday the 20th of May 2021. Today, 2020 was a record year for transgender killings in the U.S., plus President Joe Biden ups his rhetoric to Israel's Prime Minister as airstrikes continue in Gaza, and more. Taylor Wilson: Here are some of the top headlines: Taylor Wilson: Violence against transgender people in the U.S. and the world is on the rise. The United States saw a record for transgender killings last year, and in Latin America, violence has been particularly widespread. 82% of the world's transgender killings last year took place in Central and South America, according to Transrespect versus Transphobia Worldwide. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is at the heart of those two disturbing trends and has the highest transgender murder rate in the country. National correspondent for identity and inclusion issues, Marc Ramirez, has more. Marc Ramirez: Puerto Rico is part of a larger picture. There has been a rising number of killings of transgender people around the world, frankly, but in the U.S. it's been on the rise and last year hit a high of 44 homicides, and that's just reflecting the numbers that we know of, the numbers are likely more, for different reasons. Six of those murders took place in ... Well, I'm sorry, those killings, took place in Puerto Rico. And if you looked at it in a two period, heading up to January of this year, there were actually 12 such deaths in Puerto Rico. So, for an island community, that is so small compared to so many other places, it was a striking number of deaths there. Marc Ramirez: The reasons for that are similar to what you would find here in the U.S., where you've got a lot of rhetoric going around, especially when Donald Trump was president, was feeding a lot of that. So, there's just been a lot of political backlash, but in Puerto Rico, you have to look at Puerto Rico, even though it's a U.S. territory is really part of Latin America. And that whole region, it's a heavily Catholic part of the world that has traditionally opposed LGBTQ rights. And so, with political parties that are rooted in this fundamentalism, there's a lot of rhetoric going on in Puerto Rico also, that leads to some of this violence. Marc Ramirez: One thing that was really striking was in talking to some of the trans women who live in Puerto Rico, I was just trying to get a sense of what their life was like, there's a very tight knit community. They're all very supportive. They watch out for each other. But many people choose to, they go out after dark because they're less conspicuous. They travel in groups. They don't drive or go anywhere alone. There was one woman who said that when they go out, after they're heading home for the night, she drops off her friends and she doesn't stop for anything on the way home, not even stop for gas, she just goes straight home. And so, people are definitely feeling like they need to be more careful in order to avoid danger. Taylor Wilson: To read Marc's full story, search, ""Puerto Rico,"" on usatoday.com. President Joe Biden will sign the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law on Thursday. The legislation comes as hate incidents against Asian-Americans have climbed significantly for more than a year. According to Stop AAPI Hate, there were more than 6,600 hate incidents against Asian and Pacific Islander people in the U.S. since the pandemic slammed the country in March of 2020, and reports of hate crime are particularly rising in recent months. Taylor Wilson: The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State, San Bernardino, found there was a 164% increase in anti-Asian hate crime reports to police in the first quarter of 2021, across 16 cities, and a mass shooting in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian women, highlighted recent trends. The Hate Crimes Act is meant to fight back against the attacks and racism. It will speed up the Justice Department's review of hate crimes, and also designate someone at the department to oversee the effort. Additionally, it will task the justice department to coordinate with local law enforcement groups and community-based organizations, to raise awareness about hate crime reporting. That includes an online hate crime reporting system available in several languages. The bill passed the House overwhelmingly 364 to 62 on Tuesday, author of the bill, Congresswoman Grace Meng. Grace Meng: Those of Asian descent have been blamed and scapegoated for the outbreak of COVID-19 and as a result, Asian-Americans have been beaten, slashed, spat on, and even set on fire and killed. The Asian-American community is exhausted from being forced to endure this rise in bigotry and racist attacks. Asian-Americans are tired of living in fear and being frightened about their kids or elderly parents going outside. People often ask what Congress is doing about this, and we are here today to say that Congress is taking action. Asian-Americans have been screaming out for help and the House and Senate and President Biden have clearly heard our pleas. Taylor Wilson: The bill passed the Senate last month in a major bi-partisan vote, 94 to one. Another day brings more Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. Israel killed at least one Palestinian and injured others in its latest strikes on the territory. Israel continues to stress that it is going after Hamas militants, which it and the United States consider terrorists. But recent strikes have hit private homes and residential neighborhoods, and at least 64 children are among the 227 Palestinians who have been killed in less than two weeks of recent fighting. Taylor Wilson: In Israel, Hamas militants have killed 12 people, including a five-year-old boy. The latest round of fighting between Israel and Hamas was sparked by aggressive Israeli police tactics at Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, as Muslims celebrated Ramadan and as Jewish settlers threaten to forcefully removed dozens of Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem. On May 10th, Hamas then fired long range rockets toward Jerusalem and Israel continues to respond with airstrikes. Taylor Wilson: Israel is facing increasingly strong pressure from abroad to deescalate the strikes and that includes President Joe Biden. In his strongest statement yet on the conflict, he told Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Wednesday, that he expects, ""A significant deescalation today, on the path to a ceasefire."" Biden had previously avoided pressing Israel more directly, but U.S. Democrats are increasingly pushing him to take more aggressive actions. Many Republicans see the conflict as Israel defending itself, the House Republican Israel Caucus spoke Wednesday, Congressman Lee Zeldin. Lee Zeldin: Israel has an inherent right of self-defense. The Hamas is a terrorist organization and an Iranian proxy that seeks to wipe Israel off the map. They had actually put it into their charter, calling for jihad. Hamas has launched more than 3,100 rockets at Israel and counting. Israel's Iron Dome has blocked 90% of these rockets. It says a lot about Israel's neighbors, that it needs a complex missile defense system like this, and fortunately, the United States has been there for Israel in the past, now is the time to ensure that we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Taylor Wilson: Netanyahu says Israel will push ahead to return calm and security to its citizens, and will continue the current operation. Officials from several European countries, including Germany, are arriving in Israel Thursday, and negotiators from Egypt are waiting for an Israel response to a ceasefire offer. Protests continue around the world but activists, including in the U.S., say a ceasefire may only be a band-aid solution to generations of conflict. Al-Awda, the Palestine Right to Return Coalition, has been fighting for Palestinian justice for years. Florida chapter chair, Anas Amireh. Anas Amireh: It's not just a matter of putting a bandaid on it and having Jordan and Egypt and someone from the U.S. go out and say, ""Hey, let's have another ceasefire."" It doesn't work like that. This is occupation. The occupation needs to end. Taylor Wilson: For all the latest from Israel and Palestine, stay with the world news section on usatoday.com. Thursday is Global Accessibility Awareness Day. The event promotes digital access for people living with disabilities. It's the 10th year of the day and events are scheduled around the world, including online. Tech companies are also increasingly stepping up their game when it comes to accessibility, and to mark the day, Apple is rolling out SignTime, which lets customers communicate with a number of retail services, using sign language. Coming later this year, Apple will begin assistive touch for Apple Watch users. It allows those with upper limb differences to use the watch without necessarily touching the display. Instead, they'll be able to use certain hand gestures like pinching or clenching, and also iPad users will soon have more access to third-party eye tracking devices, that let them control the iPad with just their eyes. Head to the tech section on usatoday.com for more accessibility features. Taylor Wilson: Golf's second major of the year tees off Thursday. The 103rd PGA Championship begins on Kiawah Island in South Carolina, Collin Morikawa enters as the defending champion from last year's event, which was played in August due to the pandemic. He'll open the tournament alongside last month's Masters champ, Hideki Matsuyama, and 2020 US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau. One star is still missing though, Tiger Woods is recovering from injuries during a February car accident, and will not play.

President Biden signs COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act President Joe Biden on Thursday signed into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act that passed through Congress in an increasingly rare show of bipartisanship, hailing the effort a ""significant break"" in a gridlocked Washington. Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman and person of Asian descent to hold the office, opened the signing ceremony by thanking lawmakers present for their work including Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., who introduced the bill. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, also received a nod from Biden for showing up to the ceremony which was dominated by Democrats. Without masks and social distancing, it was largest-scale event at the White House since the Biden administration began. ""To the members of our United States Congress on both sides of the aisle who helped pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, thank you,"" Harris said first to applause. ""Because of you, history will remember this day and this moment when our nation took action to combat hate."" Biden said he hopes the signing ceremony, which comes during Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI, Heritage Month, marks the end ""first significant break"" in a hyper-partisan era and sends this message to the Asian American community: ""We see you."" ""For centuries, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, diverse and vibrant communities have helped build this nation only to be often stepped over, forgotten, or ignored,"" he said. ""My message to all of those who are hurting is, we see you. And the Congress has said, we see you. And we are committed to stop the hatred and the bias."" The president also called the history of mistreatment against the AAPI community in the U.S. ""un-American."" ""Silence is complicity. And we cannot be complicit. We have to speak out. We have to act. That's what you've done. And I can't thank you enough,"" Biden said. ""I'm proud today."" In what was one of the first event's since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new guidance for those vaccinated from COVID-19, several Democratic lawmakers gathered inside the East Room without masks and social distancing for the bill signing. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was seen closely chatting before the ceremony with Attorney General Merrick Garland, who sat front row for the remarks alongside Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Asked how it felt to be inside the White House without a mask, Pelosi told one reporter, ""Fabulous."" Drafted in response to an alarming rise in violence against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, the legislation is intended to expedite the review of pandemic-related hate crimes and make grants available to help local law enforcement improve reporting of bias-driven incidents. It specifically directs the Justice Department to designate a point person to assist with expedited review of COVID-19 hate crimes, provide guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to establish online reporting of hate crimes in multiple languages, expand ""linguistically appropriate"" public education campaigns and issue guidance on best practices to curb racially discriminatory language in describing the pandemic. The House of Representatives on Tuesday gave final passage to the bill with a 364-62 vote after the Senate passed the bill last month, 94-1. All votes in opposition were from Republican members, with Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who challenged the results of the 2020 election after the Capitol attack, standing out as the lone senator to vote against it. Biden pledged to swiftly sign the legislation, tweeting Thursday morning that ""Hate has no place in America."" More than 6,600 hate incidents against the AAPI community have been reported in the year since the pandemic began, according to a report this month from Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition addressing anti-Asian racism. Another recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, on hate crimes against Asian Americans in major U.S. cities found a 164% increase in reported crime in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, before the pandemic surged. Harris said in her remarks Thursday that the violence is nothing new. ""In my life, my lived experience, I have seen how hate can pervade our communities,"" Harris said. ""I have seen how hate can impede our progress and I have seen how people uniting against hate can strengthen our country."" ""This bill brings us one step closer to stopping hate, not only for Asian Americans, but for all Americans,"" she added. Democrats have argued the rise in crimes against Asian Americans is linked to former President Donald Trump's branding of COVID-19 as the ""China virus,"" among other names. While some advocates say the bill takes relatively modest steps to equip law enforcement and communities to better deal with the rise in violence against the AAPI community, House Democrats argued Tuesday the legislation will help prevent attacks by facilitating better reporting of the incidents. The legislation was introduced after the shooting of eight people, including six Asian women, at several spas in the Atlanta area in March. Those women are memorialized in the bill's text. The mass shooting followed a general rise in anti-Asian sentiments across the country.

In a ceremony in the White House East Room, Biden signed the first new federal hate crimes law in a dozen years and denounced what he described as the ""gut-wrenching"" attacks against Asian Americans that have surged since the spread of COVID-19 across the country. ""I believe with every fiber of my being that there are simple core values and beliefs that should bring us together as Americans,"" Biden said. ""One of them is standing against hate."" Hate in the U.S. hides in plain sight and too often is met with silence, Biden said. ""Every time we're silent, every time we let hate flourish, you make a lie of who we are as a nation,"" he said, his voice rising. More: AAPI pride: Asian and Pacific Islander heritage helps lift America to what it must be The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, expedites the Justice Department’s review of hate crimes and designates an official at the department to oversee the effort. It also provides grants to states to improve hate crime reporting. Violence against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities has been on the rise for more than a year with the spread of COVID-19 and as some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, blamed China for the pandemic. More than 6,600 anti-Asian hate incidents have been reported in the year since the pandemic arrived in the U.S., according to Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit group that tracks incidents of hate and discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. Reported cases jumped more than 164% in the first quarter of this year in 16 major cities and jurisdictions, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.

By NICK NIEDZWIADEK 05/20/2021 03:40 PM EDT Link Copied President Joe Biden on Thursday signed into law anti-hate crime legislation in response to the surge of attacks on Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Every time we’re silent, every time we let hate flourish, we make a lie of who we are as a nation,” Biden said before signing the bill two days after Congress finished passing it. “We cannot let the very foundation of this country continue to be eaten away like it has been in other moments in our history and happening again.” The newly enacted law would establish a position within the Justice Department centered on anti-Asian hate crimes and allocate resources to enhance state and local reporting. The legislation passed with overwhelming majorities in both chambers, a relatively rare occurrence in recent years, and was a product of bipartisan deal-making that has eluded other highly charged issues. In his remarks at the White House, Biden repeatedly underscored the bipartisan nature of the legislation as an achievement in a Congress that has often been polarized into paralysis. Biden also thanked Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — whom he obliquely referred to as “the leader from the state of Kentucky” — and Republicans for not filibustering the measure as some Democrats had initially feared. Negotiators struck a deal to allow votes on a handful of amendments to the bill and made several tweaks to the legislative language, ultimately freeing up the legislation to sail through Congress. Republicans earlier in the process expressed concern that the legislation was duplicative of other hate crimes statutes and would be designed instead to use as a political cudgel against the GOP. Former President Donald Trump and other Republicans enraged Democrats and many Asian American advocates by derisively referring to the coronavirus as the “China virus” repeatedly and using other inflammatory terms. Hate crimes against Asians and Asian Americans more than doubled in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year, according to a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. However, advocates say those figures vastly undercount the actual number of hate crimes and bias incidents, something the law is intended to address. “All of this hate hides in plain sight,” Biden said. “Too often, it is met with silence. Silence by the media, silence by our politics and silence by our history.” During his speech, Biden referenced several high-profile recent attacks, including this year’s mass shooting in the Atlanta area that left six Asian American women dead. The law has been met with some criticism from advocates who say it does not go far enough in addressing the root of the issue, as well as some liberals who dislike its emphasis on law enforcement amid a broader reckoning on policing practices in the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris spoke before Biden and touched upon her nuanced personal background and her status as the first Asian American to hold the position. “In my life, my lived experience, I have seen how hate can pervade our communities,” Harris said. “I have seen how hate can impede our progress, and I have seen how people uniting against hate can strengthen our country.” Link Copied © 2021 POLITICO LLC",2021-05-20 15:40:27,Biden signs anti-Asian hate crimes legislation,"politics and government,law and legislation,united states politics and government,crime and criminals",18268,https://www.politico.com/

Guaranteed automobile protection (GAP) is an optional benefit offered to car buyers who finance their purchase, according to an AG’s office news release. “If a buyer’s car is totaled in an accident, the buyer’s auto insurance typically pays only the fair market value of the car, which can be less than the amount owed on the buyer’s loan.” GAP coverage is used to bridge the difference and pay off a remaining balance owed on a car loan. American Assurance Corp. — a Lakewood-based company that acts as the GAP administrator between lenders, dealers, and consumers — did not always pay full coverage owed to consumers under Colorado law, according to the AG’s office. “We are committed to ensuring hardworking Coloradans receive the full GAP benefits they are entitled to,” said Attorney General Phil Weiser, in the release. “Our office will protect consumers by holding accountable institutions that fail to fully pay the amounts owed for GAP coverage or keep charging GAP coverage after a vehicle is already paid off.” The company cooperated with the AG’s investigation and agreed to promptly and fully refund $121,983 to consumers whose benefits were improperly withheld.

394,https://www.aol.com/entertainment/us-kids-david-hogg-parkland-184049622.html,"These teens endured unimaginable tragedy when a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, 2018. It was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history — and it transformed several of the survivors. David Hogg, Samantha Fuentes, Emma Gonzalez and Cameron Kasky, among others, emerged as vocal, passionate gun-control advocates who demanded reform and legislation through social media, a political action committee (Never Again), 2018’s March for Our Lives, which drew hundreds of thousands of protestors to Washington, D.C., and a subsequent nationwide tour. They’re now the subject of Us Kids, an enlightening and devastating new documentary from director Kim A. Snyder (Newtown) that premiered to acclaim at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. Though Parkland’s Gen Z activists have inspired millions of people across the country and given voice to a majority of Americans who favor stricter gun laws, Hogg says there is nothing special about their school or suburban South Florida community that bred such a resilient group. It’s merely a matter of privilege. “As much as I would like to think that our experience is solely based off of merit, I think most of it likely comes down to the fact that it’s a predominantly white community that was impacted,” Hogg tells Yahoo Entertainment in a new interview where he was joined by Snyder, Fuentes and Chicago activist Alex King (watch above). “Communities across the country are activated on this. It’s just some get significantly more coverage, unfortunately, than others. And because of that, they don’t get big donors, they don’t get a lot of the time. Or if they do, it’s a highly racialized view of gun violence in America.” Us Kids portrays the unification of activists from Parkland and those like King in Chicago and Bria Smith in Milwaukee, who represent the daily fight against gun violence in inner-cities across America disproportionately impacting communities of color. “I feel like when people see this, they’re gonna see that it isn’t just Black or white, it isn’t racial … but it’s us together fighting for a change,” says King. “We all saw something wrong in our country, we all saw nobody was doing nothing about it, so we as children decided to take a stand.” The issue of gun control remains intensely divisive in the U.S. The activists on the frontlines of the firearms reform debate regularly receive death threats and other threats of violence from extremists who disagree with them. “I don’t think the fear is anything that you ever really get used to,” says Hogg. “I don’t think you get used to the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world following you in the way that she did. [Before her election to Congress, the controversial Georgia politician followed Hogg around the U.S. Capitol in 2019 and berated him over his views.] There are some weird places, psychologically, you go to when you’re trying to justify why you continue doing this despite all of us having gone through so much. … There are people that want to kill us out there. And we’re gonna do everything in our power to try to mitigate and avoid that from happening. But at least in my own case, the way that I always think about it is, ultimately, in the event that I God forbid get shot or killed, they prove my point.” As also depicted in the film, Hogg in particular has drawn the most pronounced ire from gun rights advocates and right-wing politicians and media figures — far more than other prolific young activists like Gonzalez. Greene heckled him. Other conspiracy theorists called “a crisis actor.” Fox News host Laura Ingraham mocked the teen mass shooting survivor for not getting into colleges he applied to as a high school senior (he currently attends Harvard). It’s “because they’re afraid of me,” Hogg says. “I can’t think of what other reason it would be other than the fact that I’m a straight white guy and that’s typically the demographic that they to chase after. I guess you could say I’ve been significantly more overt in picking my fights with them at times, though I wouldn’t say I necessarily picked one with Marjorie Taylor Greene or Laura Ingraham to begin with. But I’m not just going to sit back, I’m going to defend myself.” The now-adult Hogg and company remain resilient in their efforts for gun reform despite a disheartening recent spate of mass shootings in cities like Atlanta, Indianapolis and Boulder, Colo., coming as the nation began emerging from a year of quarantining due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I am enraged, I am disappointed like anyone else,” says Fuentes, who was shot during the Parkland attack and has bullet shrapnel permanently embedded in her legs and behind her right eye. “But I think further, more than anything, it kind of proves a point in a way: which is that complacency kills and just hoping that an issue goes away just doesn’t make it go away. “It’s a bit trivial at times, what keeps people hopeful. It’s usually the tribe — it’s this, right here, it’s David, it’s Alex, it’s Kim. Otherwise there’s not much else except for each other. We don’t have anything else but a bunch of really scary adults screaming at us [on] a constant basis about an issue you’d think that people would care about.” Us Kids is now in theaters and on video on demand. — Video produced by Jon San and edited by Steve Michel Watch the trailer: Read more on Yahoo Entertainment: Stephen Colbert mocks 'child-harassing psychopath' Marjorie Taylor Greene's conspiracy theories Seth Meyers calls for media boycott of certain words following Boulder shooting George Conway blames Trump and conspiracy theorists like Marjorie Taylor Greene for 'moral collapse' of GOP",2021-05-19 14:40:49,"'Us Kids': David Hogg, Parkland gun-control activists talk recent mass shootings and living in fear","motion pictures,documentary films and programs",150985,http://news.aol.com/

Biden thanked a bipartisan group of lawmakers during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House for coming together to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. The president added that standing against hatred and racism, which he called “the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation,” is what brings the nation together. “My message to all of those who are hurting is: We see you and the Congress has said, we see you. And we are committed to stop the hatred and the bias,” he said. President Joe Biden signs the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law at the White House on May 20, 2021 (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The new law directs the Justice Department to accelerate its review of reported hate crimes related to COVID-19 and expedites the process of reporting such crimes to authorities. It also includes a bipartisan provision that offers federal grants to state and local law enforcement to improve hate crime reporting. The legislation was introduced in late March by Democratic New York Rep. Grace Meng and Democratic Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono. It was passed in the Senate in April by a 94-1 vote and was later passed in the House on Tuesday by a 364-62 vote. The legislation originally lacked widespread Republican support but was ultimately endorsed by several notable Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He and Maine Sen. Susan Collins were among the Republicans reported in attendance at Thursday’s signing ceremony, according to NPR. The new law is a response to the reported increase in violence and hate crimes against Asian Americans during the pandemic. Multiple violent attacks have been reported in a number of cities over the past several months. A mass shooting in March killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at an Atlanta massage parlor.

396,https://www.rawstory.com/marjorie-taylor-green-2653059433/,"Not long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials. by Isaac Arnsdorf ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. The ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts. Greene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racistremarks. In December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. “It's time to fight back now before it's too late,"" Greene said in one of the videos. Immediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to “make a contribution today."" Under federal law, candidates and elected officials cannot “solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election … unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements"" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines “solicit"" as “to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,"" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including “the conduct of persons involved in the communication."" Legal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks. Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line. “This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,"" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, “becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this."" Ryan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend. Political operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing. Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use — in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage. The Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC. “Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit — that is clear and indisputable,"" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart."" The Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue. “My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,"" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations. Still, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said. “The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,"" Baran said in an email. The Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, “I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write."" Greene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection. In February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders. Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with “a bullet to the head."" Those incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff “berated"" and “threatened"" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists. It is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for “digital and television advertising"" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. The super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads. FEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs. Cynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick “Chip"" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment. Another large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment. Greene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000. Shaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, “The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed."" In another ad, Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled “gun control"" and “socialism."" Shaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence. “Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself — the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,"" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones. “This is it. Nov. 3, freedom is on the ballot."" Greene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her. An Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police “had every intention of providing security"" and had “all necessary measures in place."" Chris Dorr didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor's proposed gun regulations. “There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,"" Dorr said in an online video. “We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards."" Greene also touted the Dorr brothers' American Firearms Association's endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations. An article on the far-right website Breitbart said Greene's bill was a response to an abandoned effort late last year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict equipment that makes it possible to use pistols like assault weapons. This type of weapon was later used in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting in March. In April, Greene's campaign said it would raffle off a version of the weapon. “I'm giving away the gun that triggers the Fake News Media,"" Greene said in an email to supporters. ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

After a shooting in America gets national attention, the debate usually centers around a few gun control measures, particularly universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. That’s what happened after the April mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis — with President Joe Biden calling on Congress to pass both measures. But if America wants to make a real dent in gun violence, it might want to consider another approach: requiring a license to buy and own a firearm. For one, the evidence on the effects of universal background checks and assault weapons bans is pretty weak. Several studies in recent years have found that universal background checks, at least on their own, don’t seem to have a big effect on gun deaths. Similarly, the research on assault weapons bans, including the national ban that Biden helped pass in 1994, found they have little effect on gun violence, largely because the vast majority of such violence is committed with handguns. But there’s some solid evidence that a license system reduces gun deaths. A 2018 study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that universal background checks alone correlated with more gun homicides in urban counties, while license systems were associated with fewer gun homicides. Other studies have similarly found that license requirements lead to fewer gun deaths. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. One way to explain these findings is that the reach of universal background checks and assault weapons bans is too small. The US already has background checks for most legal gun purchases, and all universal background checks would do is cover the minority of gun purchases not detected in the existing system. An assault weapons ban would cover a minority of guns used in crimes and would probably have loopholes that miss segments of that minority. A license system, though, is more comprehensive. In Massachusetts, one of the few states with a license system, obtaining a permit requires going through a multi-step process involving interviews with police, background checks, a gun safety training course, and more. Even if a person passes all of that, the local police chief can deny an application anyway. That creates more points at which an applicant can be identified as too dangerous to own a gun; it makes getting and owning a gun harder. Whatever one makes of all of this, the evidence strongly suggests the license requirement works. Massachusetts, for one, has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country. Democrats in Washington, DC, however, seem unenthusiastic. Only a few lawmakers, like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker have embraced a license requirement. On the campaign trail, Biden voiced skepticism about the idea, claiming it “will not change whether or not people buy what weapons — what kinds of weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them.” Public opinion can’t be blamed here. A recent poll by Data for Progress found that 69 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans and gun owners, support a license system — more support than an assault weapons ban received in the same survey. Now, the reality is Democrats are unlikely to do anything big on guns in the coming years, given their razor-thin margins of control in the House and Senate. But if Biden and other party leaders want to raise the issue of gun violence, they might as well focus on the policies with the strongest evidence behind them — especially if those same policies happen to have the public’s support. It’s not clear if universal background checks and an assault weapons ban meet those criteria. But requiring a license to buy and own a gun does. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

398,http://feeds.dailykosmedia.com/~r/dailykosofficial/~3/IXXfDBh68gY/-Morning-Digest-Why-the-stakes-are-so-high-in-next-year-s-races-for-the-Illinois-Supreme-Court,"The Daily Kos Elections Morning Digest is compiled by David Nir, Jeff Singer, Stephen Wolf, Carolyn Fiddler, and Matt Booker, with additional contributions from David Jarman, Steve Singiser, Daniel Donner, James Lambert, David Beard, and Arjun Jaikumar. ● IL Supreme Court: Four seats on Illinois's closely divided Supreme Court are up for election next year, and one key race that could determine which party winds up with the majority might attract a much bigger name than usual: Politico's Shia Kapos reports that Republican Rep. Darin LaHood ""could be interested"" in running for the 3rd Judicial District, conservative-leaning turf that stretches from the southern Chicago suburbs through Peoria all the way across the state to the Iowa border. LaHood, who hails from a well-known political family, might be eyeing the contest in part because Democrats could soon eliminate his 18th Congressional District and throw him in with another Republican, since they control the redistricting process and Illinois will drop from 18 districts to 17 thanks to reapportionment. The 3rd District is also open, for an unusual reason: Last year, Democrat Thomas Kilbride became the first Supreme Court justice to lose a retention election in Illinois history after he failed to win the 60% supermajority he needed to earn another 10-year term. As a result of that loss, state law requires a new election be held at the next available opportunity—in this case, Nov. 2022. Unlike a retention election, where voters simply vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on keeping an incumbent in office, this race will be a traditional partisan affair between multiple candidates, hence the possibility of a LaHood candidacy. Kilbride's court-appointed replacement, Democrat Robert Carter, has said he won't run, so Democrats will need to find a new candidate of their own, too. The 3rd District will be a major battleground because if Republicans flip it while holding a seat in the neighboring 2nd District, they'll also flip control of the court, which Democrats control 4-3. The 3rd is a particularly ripe GOP target because it voted for Donald Trump 51-47 last year, and in a typical midterm, that sort of lean would likely create a serious headwind for Democrats. That same factor should help Republicans hang on to the 2nd District, which backed Joe Biden 55-43, especially since Justice Michael Burke is seeking re-election. (There are also retention elections in the 1st and 4th Districts, which are respectively held by a Democrat and a Republican, but the incumbents should both be heavily favored.) The ultimate stakes, however, are even higher. Five years ago, as Stephen Wolf explains in a new piece, the Illinois Supreme Court struck down a Republican-backed ballot initiative on redistricting that would have prioritized compact districts over fair outcomes. Maps drawn to reflect these priorities would have locked in an unwarranted advantage for the GOP thanks to a decades-long history of racist redlining and white flight segregation in Chicago that has left voters of color heavily concentrated in urban areas. A Republican-run court could, however, greenlight such an initiative, which in turn could lead to perverse outcomes, such as Democrats winning fewer seats than Republicans in Congress despite winning more votes in statewide races, as they almost always do in solidly blue Illinois. The same outcome could even happen in the state House and Senate, handing Republicans control of the legislature. Undergirding worries about potential congressional and legislative maps is a very problematic map for the Supreme Court itself. Illinois is one of just four states that elects the members of its top court by district rather than statewide, using a map that hasn't been redrawn in over half a century. That's led to extreme malapportionment, with the rural 4th and 5th Districts in the conservative southern part of the state now home to fewer people combined than the 2nd District, which is based in the Democratic-leaning Chicago suburbs. Republicans have benefitted from this state of affairs over the past decade, which federal jurisprudence doesn't view as a problem because the courts say judicial districts don't have to have equal population, the thinking being that judges aren't representative officials. But just because lawmakers don't have to redraw the court's map doesn't mean they can't do so. In fact, they're empowered to do just that, and it's possible they will: Reporter Dan Vock says there have been reports ""that new judicial maps are in the works,"" though he adds he's been unable to confirm them yet. Democrats in the legislature may be eager to come up with new lines that shore up their majority on the Supreme Court, but doing so would also correct a serious imbalance that boosts one part of the state over another for no justifiable reason. And that, in the end, could leave LaHood out in the cold, both on the congressional front and the judicial. ● NH-Sen: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu offered some very weird comments recently when asked on a radio show whether he'd spoken with Mitch McConnell about running for Senate, first saying he hadn't talked to McConnell, then immediately backtracking and admitting he had: I have not spoken with Mitch McConnell about this issue. I've spoken with him on anoth—no, I take that back. I did speak to Mitch. I'm sorry, no, I did speak to Mitch McConnell. I've spoken to a bunch of senators, frankly, I've spoken to a bunch of governors. They come and go. They come and go, we guess, like memories of conversations with Senate minority leaders: Sununu's fuzziness came two days after Politico reported that McConnell had ""personally lobbied"" the governor about challenging Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. In late February, Sununu said he'd ""take a look"" at the race in ""six, seven months,"" so if he's still sticking to that timeline, that means no answer until the end of the summer at the soonest. ● OH-Gov, OH-Sen: After briefly flirting with a Senate campaign after Republican Sen. Rob Portman announced his retirement earlier this year, former GOP Rep. Jim Renacci sounds like it's governor or bust. Referring to his failed 2018 run against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, Renacci said in new remarks to Fox that ""my biggest mistake and my biggest regret was that I jumped into a Senate race because people wanted me to jump in, when I was fully prepared and running for governor."" That cycle, after he'd already spent nearly a full year on the trail seeking the open governorship, Renacci switched over to the Senate contest following fellow Republican Josh Mandel's departure from the race. Much to his chagrin, Renacci lost his bid, while Mike DeWine, who easily secured the GOP nomination for governor, won his. Now Renacci is looking for some sort of indirect vengeance, reiterating that he's still considering a challenge to DeWine, whom he's continued to trash for his aggressive efforts to protect Ohio from the coronavirus pandemic. Renacci also claims that a poll he commissioned shows him leading DeWine, but he hasn't released all the details we need for inclusion in the Digest, nor has he offered a timetable for making a decision. ● PA-Sen: Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has released a new poll of a hypothetical Democratic primary for Senate that shows him with a wide lead over all his rivals, actual and potential. The survey, conducted by Data for Progress, finds Fetterman taking 40%, while Rep. Conor Lamb, who is considering the race but hasn't launched a bid yet, is in second with 21. They're followed by state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta at 9, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan at 8, Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh at 5, and state Sen. Sharif Street at 2, leaving just 14% undecided. Like Lamb, Houlahan and Street are still exploring the race, while Kenyatta and Arkoosh are already running. ● MI-Gov: Conservative radio host Tudor Dixon just joined the GOP primary for governor, but whether she rates as the first notable Republican candidate in the race is hard to say: She has no Wikipedia page, and her Twitter following numbers less than 8,000. ● NM-Gov: New Mexico reporter Joe Monahan says that retired Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Greg Zanetti is considering a bid against Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham next year. Zanetti unsuccessfully sought the GOP nod for lieutenant governor all the way back in 1994, then ran an abortive campaign for governor in 2009, dropping out after just a few months. ● PA-Gov: Republican state Rep. Doug Mastriano, whose resignation Democrats have called for due to his role in instigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, has been mentioned as a possible candidate for this open seat, and now he’s publicly considering a bid. He also claims he would have the backing of the most powerful man in Republican politics if he were to take the plunge: In a radio interview, Mastriano said he met with Donald Trump regarding an endorsement and even says Trump encouraged him to run. At first, an unnamed Trump aide declined to comment on Mastriano’s claims to the Associated Press, though another Trump staffer (or possibly the same one) later confirmed to the Philadelphia Inquirer's Jonathan Tamari that a meeting between the two men had occurred. However, this aide made clear that Trump has not issued an endorsement. Regardless, Mastriano has been attempting to position himself as the Keystone State’s Trumpiest politician for a while now: The Associated Press notes that he claims to have met with Trump 15 times (including an Oval Office get-together after the election last year during which he received a positive COVID test during the meeting). If Mastriano does get in, he’ll have stiff competition for Trump’s backing, as another Trump favorite, former Rep. (and 2018 Senate nominee) Lou Barletta, has already entered the race. ● AZ-02: Democratic state Rep. Daniel Hernandez has kicked off a bid for this Tucson-area open seat. Hernandez is the third notable Democrat to launch a bid, following state Sen. Kirsten Engel and state Rep. Randy Friese. Before getting elected to the state House in 2016, Hernandez was an intern for former Rep. Gabby Giffords and assisted her immediatley after she was shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting at a constituent event she was hosting outside of a supermarket. Hernandez, just 20 at the time, stanched Giffords' bleeding with his bare hands and was credited with saving her life. Notably, Hernandez is the second person connected to that shooting who is vying for this seat: Friese was the trauma surgeon who attended to Giffords upon her arrival at the hospital. ● CA-48: While Democratic Rep. Harley Rouda made it clear he was very interested in a rematch while conceding to Republican Michelle Steel following his narrow loss last year, he never formally announced a campaign, and perhaps he never will. In a new piece on the impact of redistricting on next year's elections, Bloomberg's Greg Giroux characterizes Rouda as ""running again,"" a characterization Rouda affirms in his own remarks to Giroux. We'll therefore flip the switch on Rouda's status, though for the sake of clarity, we always like seeing a press release or news report when a campaign actually kicks off. ● KY-01: Former Hopkins County Republican Party Chair David Sharp says he'll challenge Rep. James Comer in next year's GOP primary, though the precise nature of his grievances with the congressman aren't quite clear. Referring to a study from the Center for Effective Lawmaking, Sharp claimed that Comer ""ranks in the bottom one-third of Republicans"" in effectiveness, which isn't actually true, at least for the most recent Congress (he ranked 121st out of 205 members rated in the House). Legislative prowess also isn't typically something disaffected conservatives hound incumbents over; usually intra-party dust-ups like these are about insufficiently ""owning the libs"" or demonstrating fealty to Donald Trump. No matter what, though, western Kentucky's rural 1st District will return a Republican to D.C. next year: According to Daily Kos Elections' calculations, it voted 73-26 for Trump, making it one of the reddest districts in the country. ● Anchorage, AK Mayor: A total of 90,000 votes have been counted as of Wednesday for last week's officially nonpartisan general election, and conservative Dave Bronson holds a raw vote lead of just over 1,200 votes—a 51-49 margin—over Democrat Forrest Dunbar. While domestic ballots can be received through Friday, the local clerk says there are very few left overall. ● New York City, NY Mayor: The conservative Manhattan Institute has commissioned a poll from the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies of the June 22 instant runoff Democratic primary that finds 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang leading Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams 22-21, with former city Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia at 13%. After the ranked choice process is simulated, Adams pulls ahead in the 11th and final round and edges out Yang 52-48. ● Erie County, PA Executive: Voters in Erie County, Pennsylvania have the opportunity in November to elect the first trans county executive in American history following Erie School Board President Tyler Titus' victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary. Titus edged out Erie County Councilman Carl Anderson 32-31, but rather than endorse them, Anderson said that he planned to decide in the next month whether to run as write-in candidate this fall. That may not actually be an option, though, as the Erie Times-News' Matthew Rink writes that state law ""restricts a candidate who lost in a primary from filing to run in a general election."" Titus will face Brenton Davis, a construction company owner who lost the 2017 Republican primary, for the right to succeed retiring incumbent Kathy Dahlkemper, a Democrat who previously represented this area in the U.S. House from 2009 to 2011. Erie County, which is located in the northwest corner of the state, backed Barack Obama by double digits in both his races, but it's become very competitive turf since then: Donald Trump took the county 48-46 in 2016, while Joe Biden prevailed 50-49 here four years later.

399,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/652905420/0/phoenix/local~Civil-Air-Patrol-honors-members-who-gave-first-aid-to-teens-in-Westgate-shooting/,"In a modest ceremony, the Arizona Wing of the Civil Air Patrol honored two of its members who helped save the lives of two injured teens in the 2020 Westgate shooting in Glendale. Maj. Randy Hammit and 1st Lt. Kelli Hammit, a married couple from Glendale and both members of CAP, were each awarded with a Silver Medal of Valor for rendering first aid to the teens on May 20, 2020. The recognition ceremony, which was held in a small lounge in Gila River Arena, was attended by members of the U.S. Air Force auxiliary and one of the victims. For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.  At the start of the ceremony, Maj. Gen. Mark Smith recognized the Hammits for their action. “Randy and Kelli ran into harm’s way, knowing they were placing their lives at risk,” he said, “and they did what needed to be done. And they took care of somebody who was needing some care.” The Hammits were each nominated for the medal, which is the highest decoration awarded to the auxiliary’s members. According to the organization, the medal is awarded to those who demonstrate “distinguished and conspicuous heroic action, at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of normal duty.” The Hammits each expressed feeling overwhelmed yet thankful for the nomination. “When they first talked to us about this award, it was incredibly overwhelming to me to think that anybody would think that what we did was what you shouldn’t do,” 1st Lt. Hammit said. “It’s just what I believe every human should do when another person is in need.” That night should have concluded as any other — peaceful with a hint of normalcy two months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, shots rang through the bustling outdoor mall, ultimately injuring three people, including two teens. At 7:25 p.m. on May 20, 2020, Glendale police responded to calls of an active shooter at the Westgate Entertainment District. Within minutes, the shooting stopped and officers arrived on the scene. A suspect was arrested by police shortly afterwards. The suspect was later identified as then-20-year-old Armando Hernandez Jr. of Peoria. Enraged by previous bullying and seeking respect, Hernandez told police he had been planning a mass shooting for three or four years and specifically targeted couples. Hernandez was later indicted by a grand jury on 39 charges, including attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault, and unlawful firing of a weapon. Hernandez is currently scheduled for trial. In an emotional statement, Destiny Bain thanked both CAP members for being the only people who rushed to her aid that evening before medical help arrived. “They were the only people that came around the corner to me,” Bain said. “Nobody else did nothing but stop and stare at me or brought out their phones to record.” Bain, who was 16 at the time of the incident, was shot once in the leg and her boyfriend, Alfredo Jaime, was shot in the chest. Both pled with Hernandez not to shoot them again. Bain was hospitalized for injuries that were not life-threatening. Jaime, who was 19 years old, was hospitalized in critical condition and underwent several blood transfusions and surgery on his lung and ribs. “To have you there and to know that I wasn’t alone fighting by myself meant a lot,” Bain said. “We will always have that memory, that trauma. But at least I wasn’t in it alone.” Reach breaking news reporter Monica D. Spencer at monica.spencer@arizonarepublic.com or on Twitter @monicadspencer. Support local journalism.

400,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/antisemitic-incidents-heightened-across-u-s-amid-israel-gaza-fighting-n1268137," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Rabbi Shaoul Hamaoui's synagogue, the Persian Hebrew Congregation in suburban Chicago, had never been defaced while he's served as spiritual leader for more than a decade. But that changed Sunday afternoon when a window was shattered and surveillance video captured two people, one carrying a stick and another holding a ""Freedom for Palestine"" sign. No one was at the synagogue at the time, and police in Skokie, Illinois, said they are investigating the vandalism as a hate crime as the search for its perpetrators goes on. The incident has jolted Skokie's Jewish community, which makes up nearly 30 percent of the town's population, and members of the Illinois Jewish Legislative Caucus condemned it as an ""attack"" targeting a congregation that is a ""visible symbol of Jewish life."" The incident, however, isn't an outlier. From New York to Los Angeles, an apparent uptick of antisemitic vandalism and incidents have been reported to police and shared on social media as deadly fighting escalated over the past two weeks in the Gaza Strip between Israelis and Palestinians. Mosques in the United States have reported damage in recent days, as well. And despite a bilateral cease-fire announcement taking hold early Friday between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, a move quickly welcomed by President Joe Biden and other world leaders, tensions continued to flare in the U.S. overnight during chaotic pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian demonstrations. ""We understand that every nationality stands with their country and there's freedom of speech in America — we respect that,"" Hamaoui said. ""But this is not right. Although there is a conflict overseas and we feel for both sides, it should not lead to violence in America."" Police in New York City are investigating an incident in which someone threw two commercial fireworks during opposing pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian protests Thursday evening in Times Square. One person suffered minor injuries, New York City Police Department Detective Annette Shelton said. Police made at least two dozen arrests during the demonstration, although the circumstances were not immediately clear. In addition, the department's Hate Crime Task Force is investigating an assault Thursday evening on a Jewish man in Times Square after a video of the apparent attack involving a group of people was shared on social media. Just witnessed a beat down in Times Square. #NYC #TimesSquare #Palestine #WTF #NewYorkCity pic.twitter.com/KSR5GQRvtw New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday he is asking the state police's Hate Crimes Task Force to assist in the investigation. Other videos show confrontations in the nearby Diamond District, where Jewish store owners have had a longstanding presence, between passersby on the street and people in cars carrying Palestinian flags. ""I unequivocally condemn these brutal attacks on visibly Jewish New Yorkers and we will not tolerate antisemitic violent gang harassment and intimidation,"" Cuomo said in a statement. Former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords tweeted Thursday that her Tucson synagogue was vandalized and that ""hate has no place in Arizona."" NBC News could not immediately confirm details about the incident. Yesterday, my synagogue in Tucson was vandalized. It's heartbreaking to see such a disgusting act in a place where so many are meant to feel safest. Despite these actions, we will not be shaken. Hate has no place in Arizona. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, said its preliminary research found an increase in online and real-world incidents of antisemitism in the U.S. amid the latest round of Israel and Hamas fighting. An analysis of Twitter between May 7 and 14 showed more than 17,000 tweets which used variations of the phrase ""Hitler was right,"" the group's Center on Extremism said in data shared Thursday. In addition, the group said, it received more than 190 reports of possible antisemitic incidents in the week after the fighting began, up from 131 incidents in the week prior. While the majority of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S. have ""stayed within the lines of free and civil discourse,"" the ADL said, it noted signs that invoke anti-Jewish tropes and Holocaust analogies. ""As the violence between Israel and Hamas continues to escalate, we are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate right here at home,"" CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement earlier Thursday afternoon. The recent rise comes after already heightened antisemitic incidents over the past few years. Last year, there were 327 reported incidents at Jewish institutions, including synagogues, schools and community centers, up 40 percent from 234 in 2019, according to the group. Research from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, found spikes in anti-Jewish bias during major conflicts in the Middle East in past years, as well as a rise in anti-Muslim bias after incidents, such as the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead. Brian Levin, the center's director, said bias incidents against Jewish Americans worsened in 2018 around the midterm elections, ""when bigoted anti-Jewish conspiracy theories were widely circulated,"" and with the attack that year on a Pittsburgh synagogue that claimed the lives of 11 people. ""Unfortunately, Jews in the U.S. get targeted around both international conflicts and domestic ones,"" he said in an email. But Muslims are also grappling with acts of vandalism and bias. Shelton, of the NYPD, said investigators found ""hate graffiti"" spray-painted on the front door of the Tayba Islamic Center in Brooklyn on May 13 after receiving a call of criminal mischief. The Hate Crime Task Force was notified, and the investigation is ongoing. The graffiti reportedly said ""Death to Palestine,"" and was discovered as congregants were celebrating Eid al-Fitr, a holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. All New Yorkers deserve to worship in peace, without fear. The vandalism at St. Athanasius Church and the anti-Palestinian graffiti at Tayba Islamic Center are unacceptable.We must build a city where hate is never scrawled on a house of worship's walls.https://t.co/lZUNDQSZfP Earlier this week, a mosque on Long Island was found vandalized with graffiti and a sacred flag on the property burned, Suffolk County authorities said. The investigation continues. Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a national Muslim American advocacy group in Los Angeles, said the attacks against both Jews and Muslims and their houses of worship are ""despicable"" and violence should not spill over into the streets. He said he was disturbed by reports this week in Los Angeles of antisemitic remarks directed at Jewish diners by people who were also yelling pro-Palestinian messages. There was also a report of men wearing Palestinian flags and shouting from cars and physically assaulting Jewish men on the sidewalk. Los Angeles police said the incident is being investigated as a hate crime and no arrests were immediately made. ""We as a city condemn last night's organized, antisemitic attack,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted Wednesday. ""Jewish Angelenos, like all residents, should always feel safe in our city."" Al-Marayati said the majority of pro-Palestinian protests have been peaceful and letting angry rhetoric overtake the larger message ""won't affect change in any way."" ""What we saw the other night on video does not help any cause,"" he added. ""Explaining and articulating the aspirations and the struggle of the Palestinian people is sufficient. You can be better than any violence or hate.""

404,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/22/systemic-racism-impacts-asian-americans-as-well/,"Trending: In the past year-and-a-half of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a dramatic rise in hate crimes against Asians. But the mass shooting of Asian women in Atlanta, the fatal attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee, the slashing of Noel Quintana’s face with a knife on a subway, the many attacks on our Asian elders – these anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiments are nothing new. These tragic events are reminiscent of the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, the Chinese American brutally murdered by two former auto workers who blamed Japanese auto companies for the loss of their jobs. While President Biden’s actions signing into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Bill on May 20th is commendable, they’re only first steps. More must be done to identify long-term solutions that can address the structural racism affecting the safety and health of Asian Americans. First, we can start by acknowledging that even those who are not direct victims of hate crimes experience worsened health as a result. Reports of the elderly avoiding walks and families postponing trips to the grocery store in fear of anti-Asian hate crimes are widespread, and such accounts of people consistently avoiding daily activities in public spaces due to the perceived dangers of living their lives can be a mental strain not only to the people choosing to stay sheltered at home but to those who hear of these painful stories as well. Second, we need to increase health care access for underserved Asian Americans. Language and culture gaps are huge barriers preventing Asian Americans from reporting hate crimes and receiving adequate health care, and our current healthcare system fails to sufficiently invest in health care providers and infrastructure that can help address those issues. For many Asian Americans, this may manifest into situations where individuals delay basic preventive health care check-ups in fear of potential social discomfort or discrimination, waiting until their health deteriorates to a point where it is too late. Third, we need immigration reform. Immigration policy directly impacts public health,  as federal law requires most legal immigrants to wait five years before they can qualify for federal safety net benefits, including the Affordable Care Act and non-emergency Medicaid. The problem is, even when immigrants do qualify for health benefits, they choose not to use them out of fear that it may jeopardize their legal status in the country and path to U.S. citizenship. Popular (and harmful) sentiments about immigration and race become enshrined in immigration policy, exacerbating health disparities and proliferating xenophobic ideas that affect Asian Americans, who are often perceived as perpetual foreigners regardless of their actual citizenship status. Furthermore, my research suggests that stress from the long and arduous process of applying for an immigration visa, a process exacerbated by politically created immigration visa backlogs, contribute to health disparities among Asian immigrants in the U.S. We need immigration policies that are just and equitable, and that streamline the immigration application process.

Finally, accurate data infrastructure that can shed light on the discrimination Asians experience in housing, healthcare, education, and the workforce are essential. One of the major reasons we have not done more to address inequities for Asian groups is because we have not had the data to do so. Especially needed are data that disaggregate Asians into the various Asian ethnic subgroups. Asian subgroups are extremely diverse socioeconomically, linguistically, and culturally. Disaggregating Asian subgroup data will help to identify where the needs are in our diverse community and direct resources to those in need. Asian Americans experience systemic racism in all sectors of society, but our needs are often overlooked.

405,https://www.nationalmemo.com/marjorie-taylor-greene-superpac-ad,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Reprinted with permission from ProPublica Not long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials. The ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts. Greene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene's campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racist remarks. In December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia's two Senate runoffs. ""It's time to fight back now before it's too late,"" Greene said in one of the videos. Immediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to ""make a contribution today."" Stop Socialism Now PAC's Ad   Greene recites a script in the super PAC's ad, which ends with a call for donations. (Screenshots from YouTube) Under federal law, candidates and elected officials cannot ""solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election … unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements"" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren't subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines ""solicit"" as ""to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,"" that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including ""the conduct of persons involved in the communication."" Legal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene's appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks. Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line. ""This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,"" Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, ""becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this."" Ryan said he's never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC's script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend. Political operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC's blessing. Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use — in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage. The Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC. ""Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can't solicit — that is clear and indisputable,"" said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. ""The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they're allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart."" The Greene ad doesn't specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue. ""My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,"" said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can't do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations. Still, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn't appear on the super PAC's online donations page, he said. ""The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene's name or likeness,"" Baran said in an email. The Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn't respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, ""I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write."" Greene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on January 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection. In February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders. Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with ""a bullet to the head."" Those incidents predate Greene's election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff ""berated"" and ""threatened"" her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists. It is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for ""digital and television advertising"" against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn't show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. The super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on December 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn't one of the super PAC's paid posts that show up in the social network's voluntary disclosures of political ads. FEC disclosures don't connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs. Cynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene's district, gave $125,000 on November 13. Her husband, Frederick ""Chip"" Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn't vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn't respond to requests for comment. Another large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on December 9. He declined to comment. Greene's extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan's firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000. Shaftan's ads for Greene's official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, ""The socialist left won't stop until America is destroyed."" In another ad, Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled ""gun control"" and ""socialism."" Shaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron, and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene's. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence. ""Once it's gone, freedom doesn't come back by itself — the only way you get your freedoms back is it's earned with the price of blood,"" Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones. ""This is it. November 3, freedom is on the ballot."" Greene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her. An Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police ""had every intention of providing security"" and had ""all necessary measures in place."" Chris Dorr didn't respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor's proposed gun regulations. ""There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,"" Dorr said in an online video. ""We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards."" Greene also touted the Dorr brothers' American Firearms Association's endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations. An article on the far-right website Breitbart said Greene's bill was a response to an abandoned effort late last year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict equipment that makes it possible to use pistols like assault weapons. This type of weapon was later used in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting in March. In April, Greene's campaign said it would raffle off a version of the weapon. ""I'm giving away the gun that triggers the Fake News Media,"" Greene said in an email to supporters. Update, May 21, 2021: The good-government advocacy group Common Cause filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission citing ProPublica's reporting and alleging that the super PAC ad featuring Greene violated the ban on candidates soliciting unlimited donations. ""The United States Supreme Court has been very clear in upholding candidate contribution limits and prohibitions on candidates soliciting funds outside those limits because such contributions lead to corruption and undermine the faith of Americans in the political process,"" the group's president, Karen Hobert Flynn, said in a statement.

406,https://www.startribune.com/a-year-in-the-life-of-the-city-that-killed-george-floyd/600060231/,"Once upon a time in Minneapolis, a police officer drove through a crowded downtown intersection, aimed a can of Mace out the window, and started spraying bystanders as if they were cockroaches. Coughing, I tweeted out a brief video of the incident on Hennepin Avenue, then went back to covering the protest last May, under the watchful eye of the Bob Dylan mural. Just another bad moment in the city's worst year. It has been viewed millions of times since then. A 22-second statement about the relationship between police and the policed, here in the city that killed George Floyd. A year ago Tuesday, we watched George Floyd die. We watched the people rise up in protest. We watched police meet overwhelming grief with overwhelming force. We watched Lake Street burn. ""This last year has just been a barrage of trauma for all communities,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said last week, just after a bullet killed 6-year-old Aniya Allen and just before a weekend mass shooting outside a downtown nightclub. It is hard to move on when it feels like it is not over. We remember the tears and the prayers, the smell of smoke and the crunch of glass underfoot. The first bright strokes of paint on the mural at the corner of 38th and Chicago. The thump-thump-thump of Blackhawk helicopters overhead. The helpers who spent weeks sweeping up broken glass and donating food to neighborhoods that had lost every grocery store within a 10-mile radius. The deep bruises all over Terry Hempfling's body faded eventually. The memories have not. Again and again that week, Hempfling joined the protests. She stood vigil in George Floyd Square and helped medics treating the injured near the Third Precinct police station. That Friday night, she found herself pinned against a chain-link fence near the Fifth Precinct with two other women, trying to unlock their bikes and comply with police orders to go home. There was so much tear gas in the air, she couldn't tell if the streetlights were on or off. Two police lines marched toward them, firing a hail of projectiles. ""I was in such a state of adrenaline, I didn't immediately realize we were being hit,"" said Hempfling, who has attended protests since she was a baby and had never experienced such violent retaliation. ""We were sitting ducks right there, just trying to unlock our bikes. Me, my friend, and one other woman ... from both sides, there were lines of police coming towards us."" Hempfling and her friend vaulted over a fence to safety. The next morning, she woke to find her body covered in bruises from less-lethal projectiles — on her back, on her breast, on her leg, where one bruise spread from her knee to her hip. We'd like to make sure this sort of violence never happens again, but we can't even get answers about why it happened last time. The city still has not released the name of the officer who Maced a crowd of people out exercising their constitutional rights last May, or any reports from the incident. Frey said the officer went on unpaid leave a few months later and left the force for good last month. ""I saw the same video that everyone else did and I was angered by what looks like to be a totally unnecessary escalation of a situation that was already completely escalated,"" Frey said. Information about that one small incident is tangled in a web of data practice requests and contract law and Minnesota's police arbitration process that undermine the mayor and police chief when they try to discipline their own police force. A few years ago, the mayor and chief tried to fire the officers who decked out the Fourth Precinct Christmas tree with racist garbage. An arbitrator returned one of the officers to duty last year. ""That whole Macing incident maybe only took a few seconds, but the impact on the public consciousness will be there for years,"" Frey said. ""That particular incident, I think, is ingrained in people's memory and does so much to prevent trust from forming."" There were at least 550 complaints lodged against Minneapolis police during the first two weeks of protest following Floyd's death. The ACLU of Minnesota filed two lawsuits against the city — one on behalf of protesters, including Hempfling; one on behalf of the press. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's use of force. ""We don't know when the next time the police are going to kill another Black, Indigenous or person of color from our community. But we know that's going to happen,"" said Isabella Nascimento, staff attorney for the ACLU of Minnesota. ""We bring these cases to [ensure] when that inevitably happens, the community, protesters and the press aren't inhibited from speaking out, from doing their jobs, from voicing their concerns."" People matter. If the past year taught us anything, you'd think it would have taught us that. But when it came time for a verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder trial, the city that killed George Floyd wrapped itself in razor wire and stationed military vehicles in the streets to protect property. And when Daunte Wright was killed at a traffic stop — shot to death by a Brooklyn Center police officer who apparently pulled her gun instead of her Taser — in the middle of the Chauvin trial, police unleashed a ferocious barrage of flashbangs, projectiles and chemical munitions against protesters. They broke bones with rubber bullets. Late last year, Hempfling left Minneapolis to care for her terminally ill father, a longtime civil rights activist. She returned last month to find the city boarded up and patrolled by National Guard troops. ""I felt terrible being here,"" she said. ""I was really feeling like this is not a place I want to live."" But recently, she's been feeling better. She joined the ACLU lawsuit, putting herself out there once again. Minneapolis' worst year is almost over. Whether the next is any better is up to us. jennifer.brooks@startribune.com 612-673-4008 Jennifer Brooks is a local columnist for the Star Tribune.
