So intent is the town on suppressing attention that officials are urging businesses, churches and institutions to not let TV vans use their parking lots. The police will also be on the lookout for any such vans parked along the winding roads outside of town. The town will not mark the anniversary of the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, which occurred on Dec. 14, 2012, with a public remembrance. Schools or houses of worship may mark the day with speeches or prayers for the 20 first graders and six adults who were killed, but there will be no globally broadcast roll call of names, no playing of bagpipes, no honor guards. “All of these children, they need a chance to be happy,” said Maria Ruggiero, an employee at the Village Perk Cafe, speaking of the town’s children. “This constant reminder of sadness, it needs to stop. That’s why we want the media to stay away.” Normally, the first anniversary of such a tragedy would draw hordes of journalists, as happened with the mass killings at Aurora, Colo., and Virginia Tech. And each year since the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, there has been extensive, live coverage by the news media as the names of the dead are read at a solemn ceremony in downtown Manhattan. But at least two TV networks — NBC and ABC — say they have no plans to dispatch fully equipped crews through Newtown that day. One TV executive said that parents had urged his network to stay away because children were still suffering from anxiety, and the sight of TV vans triggered reminders of the shootings. “NBC News is respecting the town’s wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in Newtown for the anniversary,” said Erika Masonhall, a spokeswoman for the network. CBS News plans to be there, though it has already been turned down for some spots to park trucks. “Our goal is to have the smallest footprint possible,” said Tim Gaughan, director of special events for CBS News. “We don’t want to be intrusive, but we’re confident we can report the story and not get in the way.” Beyond the desire for keeping their grief private, the town’s business owners are concerned about their economic well-being. Last December, media vehicles clogged streets, making it difficult to get to shops during the important Christmas season. “Even the places you could get to, you didn’t want to because you’d have a microphone or TV camera in your face,” said Jim Morely, a board member of Newtown Savings Bank. Patricia Llodra, Newtown’s first selectman, equivalent to a mayor, said she had unanimous support for lowering the day’s temperature. In a town of 28,000 people, she said, almost everybody is regularly reminded of the lost children and teachers by the faces and places they see. “The difference with 9/11 is that it happened in a city of millions of people,” said Ms. Llodra, who was at the firehouse when parents were told one by one that their children had been killed. “It is possible to have a life in New York without continual reminders — for us, we live this tragedy every day.” “We need our own time to heal,” she added. “We’re in this journey of recovery, 28,000 of us.” The town could not help but be reminded last month when the Connecticut state’s attorney in Danbury released a 48-page report that chronicled the rampage by the gunman, Adam Lanza, and painted a disturbing portrait of his obsession with guns and mass shootings, and his willful isolation, even from his parents. Then, on Wednesday, recordings of the calls to 911 from inside the school were released. The townspeople say they do not want to be forever defined by tragedy. “We’re not victims,” Ms. Llodra said. “We don’t see ourselves as broken and we want to be able to have a positive future.” The town has demolished one likely media focus, the school, where Mr. Lanza, 20, shot his way through a locked door, opened fire on the principal, staff members and two classrooms of first graders before shooting himself with a handgun. The town made it virtually impossible to take mementos from the building’s remains — it had the structural steel melted — or to photograph it close up. The news media could only fly overhead in helicopters as the school was razed. One singularly affected group, the parents of the 12 children who were in the invaded classrooms but survived, will no longer speak to reporters, though two confided to The Associated Press in September about the nightmares, anxiety and curiosity about perished classmates that their children still experienced. Parents of the slain children as well as unnerved neighbors — “it struck everyone with such intimacy,” said John Woodall, a local psychiatrist — continue to devote themselves to philanthropic projects and advocacy that reflect themes that were dear to their children or were a motif in the tragedy. Thirteen sets of parents have started memorial foundations to raise money for art instruction, mental health research, physical fitness, horseback riding lessons, even lessons in compassion, according to Sharon Cohen, a local writer who has compiled a book about the projects. With Joey’s Fund, Michele Gay raised $200,000 for families with autistic children like her 7-year-old, Josephine, a girl who loved Barbie dolls, swinging with her sisters, and the color purple. And Ms. Gay worked with another parent, Alissa Parker, whose daughter Emilie was also killed, to help improve school security. “It doesn’t take away the pain of missing her, the heartache of how we lost her,” Ms. Gay said of her efforts. “But at the very least it allows us to help others.” Mark Barden started “What Would Daniel Do?” to promote what he calls acts of kindness. Daniel, his son, was a child who would pick a worm up from the driveway and return it to the grass, Mr. Barden said, or help a classmate with a stuck jacket zipper. “We’re not going to have his presence in our life so we’re going to do what we can do to do the things he would have done,” he said. Townspeople who did not lose a family member have also channeled their emotions into action. Po Murray, who lived 50 yards from the killer’s house, has met Congressional representatives to push for laws to deter gun violence. Last March, Monte Frank, a lawyer, and two dozen cyclists rode 375 miles to Washington for the same cause. The families of victims support the decision to observe the anniversary out of the limelight, even if, paradoxically, they are grateful to the media for the blizzard of condolences. Ms. Gay, who moved to Massachusetts this year, said that every encounter with journalists had been respectful. Still, she said, Dec. 14 should not be a day to be swamped. “It’s difficult enough to have to go through this and no one should, but it’s very important to all the families that they own their own grieving process,” she said.

Our nation’s fathers would be weeping with the angels. Special Correspondent Forget the Sandy Hook killer, but remember the Sandy Hook heroes such as 6-year-old Jesse Lewis, who had just seen his teacher shot when the gunman’s rifle jammed. Rather than use this moment to save himself, Jesse called to some fellow first graders who were standing off to the side, holding hands. “Run!” he told them. In the next moment, Jesse was killed, but the other youngsters escaped. Six of them, four boys and two girls, ended up outside a small yellow frame house nearby that is home to a psychologist named Gene Rosen. “We can’t go back to school,” one of the boys reportedly told Rosen. “Our teacher is dead.” Rosen brought them inside and took out some stuffed animals he keeps for his grandchildren and began calling parents. One little girl sat clutching a toy dog, silently staring out a window until her mother came. The last of the six survivors had been picked up when a woman appeared at the front door with a face that Rosen would later describe as frozen in terror. She had heard that some kids had come to the house and she hoped that maybe by some miracle her child was among them. The miracle was not to be. The child she named would be listed among the 20 kids who had been murdered along with six adults. In the mid-afternoon, I found the house empty and still, the stuffed animals where the children had left them as they headed home, having escaped the killer thanks to the monumental courage of a tiny hero. I took note of a wood plaque that attested to the year the house had been built. “1746” That was 30 years before the Declaration of Independence, 45 years before the ratification of the Second Amendment. I wondered what the founding fathers—whom the gun rights people love to invoke—would have said if they had happened to pass by here back then and been suddenly bestowed with the gift of prophesy. They no doubt would have been horrified enough if they could have foreseen the 1999 murder of 12 students and a teacher by a pair of teen killers at Columbine High School in Colorado. I was there in the immediate aftermath of that shooting as well. I remember standing in the parking lot, staring at a maroon Acura Legend that 17 year-old Rachel Scott had driven to school before becoming the first to be murdered, shot numerous times as she ate lunch. Her friends were now covering the car with flowers and ribbons, placing four candles on the trunk along with a Bible that the gusting wind blew open, rustling the pages as if an unseen hand were searching vainly for an answer. A classmate in jeans and a brown flannel shirt used a fingertip to inscribe a message into the road grime just above the rear bumper. “We love you.” The biggest testament was the diversity of the mourners. A girl with Day-Glo red hair embraced a born-again Christian. An athletic-looking 16-year-old named Joe Dreaden explained that Rachel Scott had possessed a unique ability to reach across social cliques. “Rachel was who she was,” he said simply. In the late afternoon, that great mix of friends formed a circle around the car, holding hands as they prayed. They then prepared to release three dozen balloons, grey and blue, the colors of their school. A balloon popped and the sound was enough like a gunshot to make everybody jump. “That was not fun,” one of the friends said. The remaining 35 balloons sailed up into the fading daylight, vanishing as they were blown northward by a weather front that brought rain and then snow that the friend Dreaden later brushed away from the car, which Scott had been paying for by working in a sandwich shop. He uncovered a handwritten message another student had left. “God danced the day these children were born. The Angels cried the day He carried them home.” Among the survivors who had run in terror from the lunchroom when the shooting erupted was Regina Rohde, then 14. She was 22 when I encountered her in 2007 at Virginia Tech in the aftermath of the mass shooting there. She had been preparing to head for class when she got word of the killings, and this time she was spared the sound of gunfire. She stood holding her small, brown dog, declining to say anything to the press about either shooting. She did allow that she had not looked at the images of himself this latest killer had express mailed to NBC as he embarked on a spree that left 32 dead. “I haven’t seen them,” she said. I went from her to a gun store by Virginia Tech’s main gate where the killer was said to have ordered one of his pistols. I then proceeded to a nearby outdoor shooting range maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. The killer had practiced his marksmanship there, firing with the same methodical deliberation that would be recalled by the survivors. He is also believed to have filmed in the parking lot some of the images of himself he later sent to NBC. Among the shooters at the range two days after the massacre were two Virginia Tech students. They were blazing away with a Glock-9, the same kind of gun the killer had used to such devastating effect. “They should only give these to responsible people,” said one of the students, David Whitlow. In a kind of manifesto, the Virginia Tech killer had written about the two Columbine killers. All three killers were studied by the twisted 20-year-old who would do the unimaginable at Sandy Hook, taking us from wondering when will the killing ever end to how could it have possibly have gotten to this? The Sandy Hook killer was also a fan of Glocks. He sometimes posted on the popular online gun forum Glock Talk, which apparently sees no irony in a requirement for all new participants. “You must register,” the site says. Only when you are duly registered and have been cleared by the site administrator are you able to view postings such as the one in which the Sandy Hook killer once spoke of his Glock “fetish.” But the Sandy Hook killer’s main weapon proved to be a Bushmaster .223 rifle. He fired 154 rounds with it in less than 11 minutes, killing a total of 26 people. He almost certainly would have killed more kids were it not for the bravery of Jesse Lewis. Eleven months after the shooting, the Connecticut State Police released its report. I noted that among many other things a search of the killer’s room produced were “materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles.” I have always felt there was a sexual component to what the Sandy Hook killer himself termed a “fetish” over guns. I suddenly wondered if this explained why the killer had gone after kids, especially since the state police report maintained that he did not seem to have been bullied when he was a student at Sandy Hook. After I wrote a piece suggesting that the Sandy Hook killer may have been acting out of some kind of homicidal pedophilia I got a call from a woman who said she represented the families of the murdered children. She informed me that the families had been greatly distressed and offended by the article, which she described as the single worst piece they had read. The only response I could think to off was to apologize and assure her that other than the families themselves nobody could feel worse about it than I did. She then demanded to know why I had written such a thing. I could only say that I had gone from killing to killing to killing for year after year after year and it was simply an attempt to address a question the state police had taken pains to avoid: why? Another question is how? The answer to that is easy; it was with a weapon capable of firing that many bullets in that short a time. The Sandy Hook Elementary School has been torn down, but the yellow house still stands with its plaque attesting to having been built before the founding fathers even promulgated the Second Amendment. That they drafted it as they did seems to me proof they did not imagine anything like the Sandy Hook Massacre could occur. They surely would have been much more precise in their language about the importance of a militia if they had known that as it was written the amendment would help to put guns in the hands of killers at Columbine and Virginia Tech and so many other places. Such a massacre could not have happened back then, and not just because Sandy Hook had only a one-room schoolhouse. The arms that the founding fathers said we had a right to bear were single shot muskets. Everybody save for perhaps one unlucky soul would have had a chance to escape while the would-be mass murderer was forced to reload. What seems certain as you now stand by that yellow house built in the time of the founding fathers is that they would be horrified to know that something they drafted in the name of freedom had contributed to 20 school children being murdered along with six adults. Would the founding fathers not join the angels in crying if they saw those half dozen terrified survivors sitting by that plaque reading 1746, saying they could not go back to school because somebody had shot their teacher?",2013-12-13 10:45:00,What if the Founding Fathers Saw Newtown?,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

Sen. Evie Hudak of Denver's western suburbs announced her resignation less than a week before opponents planned to turn in petitions seeking her recall. The resignation means Democrats will be able to appoint an interim successor and keep a one-seat majority in the Senate next session. Two other Democratic senators were ousted from office in September. The recall efforts came after Colorado's Democratic Legislature and governor last year approved a slate of gun-control measures including ammunition magazine limits and expanded background checks. The limits were the first adopted outside the East Coast after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that left 20 first-graders and six educators dead.

5,http://www.salon.com/2013/12/08/newtown_the_truth_about_sandy_hook/,"To the fog of war, add the fog of breaking news, that period in the aftermath of a disaster when mistake, rumor and other forms of misinformation cloud our understanding of what's happened. Accounts of John F. Kennedy's assassination on the 50th anniversary of that event have reminded us that this form of confusion predated the Internet and cable news. But today the news cycle has sped up, ravenously seeking new fodder in a matter of days rather than weeks. By the time more responsible investigators have nailed down the facts, the public is often no longer paying attention. For this reason, there's more call than ever for books like Matthew Lysiak's ""Newtown: An American Tragedy."" Lysiak, a reporter for the New York Daily News, covered the story of the mass shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a year ago on Saturday. At the time, the press misidentified the murderer, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, as his older brother, Ryan. (Adam was carrying Ryan's ID when he shot himself at the end of his rampage.) There were reports that Lanza's mother, Nancy, worked at the school and was killed during the shooting. (Her son shot her three times in the head that morning as she lay in bed, then left the house for Sandy Hook.) And there was talk of a second shooter -- actually a parent, apprehended then cleared by law enforcement officials when they arrived at the scene. Depending on when you checked out of the coverage, you might be harboring all sorts of erroneous ideas about the tragedy. ""Newtown"" is a just-the-facts narrative, and Lysiak is no prose stylist; he has an unfortunate propensity for clichés and dangling participles. But this book shows a deeper grasp of how to assemble those facts into a meaningful picture of events, and it is tremendously moving in the simplicity of its presentation. Lysiak balances perfectly the ordinarily wondrous lives of the 20 children and six women who were murdered against their killer's depravity. Lysiak is a master of texture, at selecting precise, individualizing details: the first-grader who asked her mother for extra tissue paper to wrap the gingerbread house she planned to make at school that day, the way Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung sometimes snuck her paperwork with her into the stands when attending school athletic events, the ""plush blue shark"" slipped into one small coffin. Lysiak's account of the shooting itself, which lasted about five minutes, and the events leading up to and following it are tersely horrific. The slaughter of so many innocents makes Sandy Hook one of the darkest nightmares in the ever-growing list of America's lone-gunman sprees, but it does have a heartening counterpoint in the selfless courage of the women who died that December morning trying to protect their charges. Hochsprung gave her life to warn her colleagues of the danger, first-grade teacher Victoria Soto stepped between Lanza and her students, and when teacher's aide Anne Marie Murphy could not hide 6-year-old Dylan Hockley from the murderer, she wrapped her body around his in an attempt to shield him. Within a day or two of this atrocity, everyone was arguing about its cause and significance, and these debates become part of Lysiak's narrative as well, though not to the point of overwhelming the story of Newtown and its citizens. The loudest rhetorical clashes occurred between gun control advocates and Second Amendment absolutists like the firearms-industry-funded NRA, but other debates raged as well: over the import of Lanza's diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome and whether reporting this was prejudicial to people with autism, as well as Lanza's obsession with video games. Interest groups fearing stigma or regulatory crackdowns sought to deflect fault elsewhere: The gun nuts blamed the video games and a lack of adequate mental health care, the gamers blamed Lanza's parents, and advocates for people with autism blamed the gun industry. If there was a paucity of information, there was certainly no shortage of opinion and argument. For the most part, Lysiak avoids interpretation of his own. Through a judicious use of expert quotes he conveys that people with autism are not mentally ill and are no more prone to violence than the neurotypical. No causal relationship between video games and violent behavior has been shown. Finally, all of the guns Lanza owned were acquired legally, by his mother, although it seems obvious that whatever reason one might have to own a weapon capable of firing scores of rounds and mowing down 26 human beings in five minutes is probably a really, really bad reason. Nancy Lanza was the one person in a position to see how far off the rails Adam had gone. She was a tireless advocate and caregiver for her son, who had multiple neurological conditions that made it difficult for him to lead a normal life, and who had become totally isolated. He had no friends and seldom left his room (although a report released last month suggested that he might have visited a local theater to play Dance Dance Revolution). He could not bear to be touched, eventually communicating with her primarily by email, and was distressed at the slightest variation in his environment and routine. In the past, a major tailspin had been triggered when he started high school and was expected to change classrooms several times per day. His mother eventually pulled him out of school and educated him at home until he got his GED, and the Lanzas, it should be noted, were well-off enough to get him proper care. For Nancy -- described by a friend as a ""live free or die"" New Hampshire native who ""came from a culture of guns"" -- target practice was a wholesome family activity and one of the few ways she felt able to bond with her son. Yet Lysiak also establishes that in 2012 Nancy Lanza was both very concerned about Adam's mental state and had more or less given up on drawing him out of his shell, although she did hope that a planned move out of state might change that. Furthermore, Nancy was worried enough to venture into the forbidden sanctum of her son's room, where she discovered many disturbing drawings, ""gruesome depictions of death, images of mutilated corpses,"" including a ""grassy field lined with the corpses of young children."" Was she also aware of the ""massive spreadsheet, seven feet long and four feet wide,"" ranking ""the top five hundred mass murderers in world history""? That would seem like a hard thing either to miss or to shrug off. According to a friend in whom Nancy Lanza confided after finding the pictures, she hesitated to confront her son because ""she feared he might further shut her out"" and ""he would be lost forever."" Adam Lanza was also, by that point, heavily armed, and if his mother worried that any disturbance might provoke a violent reaction, she was probably right. Yet a resistance to seeking help -- or, perhaps, a contentious temperament that caused her to find fault with much of the help offered -- had left this self-reliant Yankee with the perception that she had few options. The contrast here with the abundantly interconnected community of Sandy Hook is obvious, although Lysiak never underlines that point. Other people, for all their meddling and aggravation, can be, among other things, an excellent source of reality checks. One of the pieces of evidence found in the Lanza house after the shooting was a bank draft that Nancy Lanza had written for Adam's forthcoming Christmas present -- yet another gun.

(Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group)  SUNNYVALE — One day after yet another school shooting, some 250 people on Saturday joined the national outpouring of grief and reflection to mark the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre. The public memorial was held at a Catholic church here — just five miles from the scene of another mass shooting a generation ago. They came to honor the children and adults who were killed in Newtown, Conn., framed by a hand-lettered sign that read, “We Are Newtown.” But speaker after speaker — many of whose lives have been touched by gun violence — also referred to Friday’s shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., which left one student in critical condition. They also talked about the rampage 25 years ago at Sunnyvale’s ESL Inc., where Richard Wade Farley killed seven co-workers and injured four in one of the worst mass murders in California history. No one Saturday had any easy solutions to offer for the uptick in mass killings. “What the hell are we doing in our schools?” asked Rep. Mike Honda, D-San Jose. Honda, like so many others, had no easy answers. But he said he looks to “the day we can truly say that I am my brother’s or sister’s keeper.” One thing those gathered at St. Cyprian Church could do was honor the dead: They struck a gong in memory of each of the 20 children and six educators slaughtered at Sandy Hook — and one more time to remember all those killed by guns in America. “Although we try to gain perspective on this tragedy with the passage of time,” said speaker Josh Wolf, a volunteer for Organizing For Action who helped arrange Saturday’s memorial, “repeated incidences of gun violence in our communities since then continue to challenge our sense of security and remind us that we must do more to protect each other. “Twenty-five years ago, Silicon Valley received national attention for a workplace shooting at ESL Inc. … and we keep that memory as a reminder that our community isn’t so different from Centennial, not so different from Newtown. These issues touch all of us.” Karen Hardy spoke about the shock in 1988 of watching live television coverage of the ESL shooting. She remembered frantically calling her husband at work to tell him that his co-worker, Farley, had already killed at least one person. Now Hardy teaches math and computer science at Santa Clara’s Wilcox High School, where her students practice barricading their classroom doors with desks during annual “Code Red” drills to prepare themselves for a shooting at their own school. “When we have a fire drill, they just laugh,” Hardy told this newspaper before speaking before the crowd inside the gym at St. Cyprian. But “it is amazing how seriously they take the Code Red drills.” Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez recalled a 1997 neighborhood shooting in front of her home in downtown San Jose while she was sleeping. When she crawled back into bed, she found a bullet that had entered through her bedroom wall. The shooting is “why I ran for office,” the former San Jose city councilwoman said. “I was afraid of my home. I was afraid of my neighborhood.” By the time Chavez realized what had happened, “I had gone from being frightened to very angry. … Someone could have killed my husband.” Herveline Sartori, who teaches French at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, sat in the back of the audience Saturday with two of her four children, hoping that eventually “someone will do something. People all around the nation want change.” In the meantime, Sartori’s students go through their own school-shooting drills while her children do the same at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View. When Sartori’s 10-year-old daughter, Juliette, was asked how the drills make her feel, Juliette offered a one-word answer: “Scared.” Contact Dan Nakaso at 408-271-3648.

I come today in praise of media self-restraint. And for that, I imagine the people of Newtown are grateful. As you may know, Saturday is the one-year anniversary of the heart-rending school massacre that left 20 children dead. Ordinarily, every TV outlet on the planet would invade the Connecticut town and be grabbing people to recount the horror—all in the name of reporting on the “healing” taking place. In fact, what such a mass invasion does is disrupt the healing process by turning a community’s private grief into a public spectacle. This time, however, some media outlets are just saying no. Local politicians began speaking out a couple of weeks ago, asking the media to stay away during the anniversary. First Hartford station WSFB said it wouldn’t send crews to Newtown, choosing instead to run profiles of the victims in the days leading up to the anniversary. The station said it was acting “out of respect for the community,” to “give people in the community time to be with each other to reflect on the events of that day.” Imagine that. Others began following suit. CNN said it wouldn’t send any crews. USA Today said its reporters will stay away. Here’s why this is a breakthrough. The public already thinks the media are populated by a bunch of insensitive clods. By respecting the community’s wishes, news organizations demonstrate that they are capable of empathy. The other reason is that anniversary stories are essentially bogus. They are a media ritual that use an arbitrary date to go wild over a big story from the past. Some achieve a broader cultural significance, like the 10th anniversary of 9/11 or the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination. But is Newtown a bigger story this week than it was last week or last month? The answer is obvious. A similar question came up when the 911 tapes from the day of the tragedy were released. Most television operations played only snippets; some aired none at all. I don’t think they added anything to our understanding of the mass shooting. The guidance from Fox News management, to use the tapes sparingly, struck the right tone: Imagine if these were your neighbors and you were playing tapes that took them back to that awful day? When there is a mass shooting or hurricane or flood or earthquake, it’s inevitable that hordes of journalists will parachute in. Their presence can be intrusive, but at least they are serving the broader public by reporting breaking news. But there’s no real purpose for the media to descend on Newtown this Saturday, and kudos to those who are staying home. Fox Reporter Wins Legal Victory Jana Winter is no longer facing the prospect of being jailed for doing her job. In a 4-3 ruling, New York’s top court ruled yesterday that the Fox News reporter didn’t have to testify in Colorado about her confidential sources in the Aurora movie-theater massacre. It’s a major blow in favor of press freedom, “a terrific win for all journalists,” as Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes put it. I frankly thought this was a long shot, since it required the Court of Appeals to say that New York’s strong shield law applied even though Winter was reporting in Colorado. In a dissent, Justice Robert Smith wrote: ""The majority is holding, in substance, that a New York reporter takes the protection of New York's Shield Law with her when she travels -- presumably, anywhere in the world.” Winter had exclusively reported last year on notebooks with chilling drawings that accused shooter James Holmes had sent to his psychiatrist before last year’s killings. The government wasn’t trying to force Winter to testify to determine his guilt or innocence. What was infuriating was that this was a legal sideshow initiated by Holmes’ lawyers to cast doubt on those who had denied being involved in the leak. The case has had a big personal impact on Winter and made it more difficult for her to do her job. The prospect of  her being jailed—because no reporter can break the vow to protect sources and still function as a journalist—was an appalling one that has now been averted.

17,http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/11/26/the_politicization_of_everything_120774.html,"By Victor Davis Hanson - November 26, 2013  The Obama presidency has had very little legislative success. Even the signature Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is imploding, and was dubbed a “train wreck” by one of its own Senatorial authors. The lead-from-behind retrenchment abroad from America’s traditional leadership role has won few adherents. The Benghazi tragedy and the series of alphabet-soup debacles involving the IRS, the NSA, and the AP journalists are the most disturbing political scandals we’ve seen since the Nixon administration. What, then, is the Obama legacy? An insidious politicization of almost everything. Obamism has become a holistic concept of “fundamentally transforming America” that, like all ideologies, cannot be assessed solely by concrete laws and policies, but rather through a change in the mentality and spirit of Americans and those who govern them. Obama early on emphasized in messianic fashion that his hope-and-change agenda was not to be adjudicated by traditional metrics, but involved a cosmic transformation of hearts and minds: “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” More specifically, the president himself through such colorful rhetoric has often outlined his all-encompassing “spread-the-wealth” ideology. Self-employed business people did not really “build” their successful operations without government help: “If you’ve got a business—you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.” “Fat cats” and “corporate jet owners” have preyed on the body politic. Profit-driven doctors have unnecessarily lopped off limbs and yanked out tonsils. In a more philosophical vein, Obama advised that an individual should recognize a point beyond which he need not make any more money. The subtext is always that in this zero-sum world, personal success comes not through the individual’s efforts, but at the expense of someone else. The Affordable Care Act was not intended just to extend health insurance to the uninsured or to decrease premium costs. Indeed, so far Obamacare has had the opposite effect of raising costs and increasing the numbers of the uninsured. Aside from growing government, increasing federal jobs, and limiting free choice, Obamacare federalized healthcare to ensure Americans fairness, defined as the economic equality of result as technocrats decide who had wrongly acquired too much healthcare, who unfairly had access to too little, and so on. In that regard, the recent disclosures that some Obamacare “navigators” acted like politicized operatives (e.g., “turning Texas blue”), have sometimes offered advice to consumers to defraud the government, and often worked in league with liberal activist groups and the Democratic Party were not surprising. It is the duty of a progressive federal government to make the necessary redistributive changes to ensure that the more deserving obtained more healthcare and the less deserving were to pay for it. Only elites possess the savvy to oversee the necessary transaction for the ignorant. Or, as the President said of popular anger at Obamacare, “the majority of folks will end up being better off, of course… They don’t necessarily know it right [now].” When Barack Obama advised his Latino supporters to adopt a political stance in which “We’re going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us,” he simply illustrated how the immigration debate had become driven by ideology. The issues are not non-partisan criteria about qualifications for legal immigration—education levels, skill sets, or capital. Nor is there much nonpartisan concern with border enforcement and the sanctity of federal law. Instead, the influx of millions of mostly poor Latin Americans and Mexican nationals and their incorporation into the United States, as liberal citizen constituents and consumers of federal programs, drive the debate. Anything or anyone that might hamper those political efforts prompts the necessary philological rejoinders—both the overblown invectives of “nativist” or “racist” and the usual Orwellian euphemisms (“illegal immigrant” or “illegal alien” must be replaced by the politically-correct “undocumented worker”). To make legal immigration entirely meritocratic and ethnically- and racially-blind would not necessarily ensure the sort of immigrant pool receptive to the Obama ideological agenda, and is therefore opposed by Democrats. Predicating amnesties on criteria like prior crime-free residence without dependence on federal and state entitlements would likewise be ideologically incorrect and not serve the larger agenda. No one believes that the present immigration debate is concerned with the bureaucratic dilemma over granting green cards or citizenship to Eastern European doctors or South Korean engineers. There was little mystery over the IRS scandals of illegally granting an estimated $132 billion in earned income tax credits to the undeserving, coupled with the unlawful scrutiny of the tax-exempt status of Tea-Party-like organizations. No one initially assumed that an errant IRS either had been unduly stingy in paying credits to the deserving or had gone after the tax-exempt status of leftwing groups in equal number. For an IRS commissioner like Lois Lerner and others in the age of Obama, the noble ends of using government to achieve social and economic equality apparently condone the occasional unpleasant means of transgressing existing and supposedly unfair laws. The worry in the billion-dollar federal settlements in the Pigford case was not, in the words of the New York Times, that “the $50,000 payouts to black farmers had proved a magnet for fraud.” Rather, regulations about timely applications and eligibility were irritable details that paled in comparison with the larger truth that poorer people deserved redistributive compensation from a sympathetic federal government whose chief responsibility is not to protect freedom and liberty but to find ways to mandate equality. Quantitative easing and the policies of the Federal Reserve board are likewise not just aimed at spurring economic growth. Indeed, for the last five years the unemployment rate has never dipped below 7 percent and annual GDP growth has averaged less than 2 percent per annum—despite historical expansions of the money supply and de facto below zero interest rates when adjusted for inflation. In truth, those with passbook savings accounts lost value on their money; those who had not accrued capital were not affected; and borrowers became the beneficiaries of record low interest rates. Since classical times, the demand for equalization of income and capital was traditionally focused on a cancellation of interest rates. In such an ideological landscape, almost everything is ripe for fundamental transformation, sometimes even in the most unlikely of areas. In the old days, the primary mission of NASA was to explore the heavens. Not necessarily so now. Obama NASA appointee Gen. Charles Bolden related that President Obama had given him three explicit directives. None apparently involved improving the operation of the agency or enhancing its explorative and scientific mission of space. Instead Bolden’s tripartite aims were to be entirely social, ideological, and political. One was to “re-inspire children to want to get into science and math.” A second was “to expand our international relationships.” A third, Bolden told news agency Al Jazeera, was “perhaps foremost,” and was “to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science and engineering—science, math and engineering.” Again, note the nature of the “foremost” ideological mandate: if Muslim nations do not feel “good” about their historical contributions to science and engineering, such depression could not be attributed to their present scientific ossification or Islam’s often historical subordination to Western science, especially after the fifteenth century. Instead, the discontent over the absence of scientific parity might be due to other more nefarious causes—and thus in part rectified by the power, wealth, and influence of a properly sensitive U.S. federal government. Similarly, homeland security is no longer just about ensuring the safety of the United States. In a series of bizarre euphemisms—overseas contingency operations, man-caused disasters, work-place violence—Islamic terrorism was redefined as a spontaneous tragedy without specified causation. To the degree that the issue of radical Islam was unavoidable in the debate over U.S. domestic and foreign policy, the contortions only grew worse: we should not allow the mass murderer Major Hasan to prejudice the Army’s diversity program; the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was largely secular; and jihad is a legitimate tenet of Islam properly characterized as a “holy struggle,” and therefore improperly associated with radical Islamic terrorists. The politicization of almost every aspect of American culture and politics over the last five years could easily be expanded. Traditional employment background checks are now “racist” given that minorities with higher crime records might be unduly affected. The 2009 reordering of the Chrysler creditors leap-frogged junior union creditors over senior bondholders—as enforcement of existing legislation becomes predicated on perceptions of social justice rather than faithfully executing settled laws on the books. Each new tropical storm launches a fresh debate about “climate change,” despite no evidence that recent weather is more prone to hurricanes or the planet has heated up over the last 15 years. Almost every new mass shooting offers occasion for mobilization to enhance existing gun control legislation. What energizes this effort at holistic transformation is real anger at the perceived unfairness of the current democratic capitalist state—what Michelle Obama once referred to when she characterized America as “just downright mean.” Most of us unfortunately are unaware of these tensions in our otherwise “uninvolved, uninformed” lives. Indeed, in the words of former Energy Secretary Steven Chu, we are mere adolescents “just like your teenage kids” who “aren’t acting in a way that they should act.” The government defines “should”; the people do not. The antidote has been for Obama administration technocrats to reexamine the way Americans go to the doctor, borrow money, pay their taxes, secure their borders, protect their country, explore space, and contemplate the weather. In each case, it turns out that someone wealthier and more privileged than the majority has done something wrong. The remedy is to provide more power and money to an all-knowing government elite who alone has the wisdom and morality to make things fairer by making them more equal. In our present landscape where everything must be political, the government’s hunt for victims and their oppressors has become ceaseless.

FILE: December 15, 2012: A visitor supports residents grieves for victims of an elementary school mass shooting, at the entrance to Sandy Hook village, in Newtown, Conn. (REUTERS) Though Congress has done little to increase spending or enact laws to improve mental-health care after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shootings, dozens of states have increased or restored such funding. States struggling to make ends meet during the recent recession cut more than $4 billion from their mental-health budgets from 2009 through 2012. Now with the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14, 2012, Sandy Hook elementary school shootings just days away, a new report shows at least 37 states have increased spending on mental health programs. Texas lawmakers appear to have approved the biggest increase -- $259 million more in their newest two-year budget, the largest such increase in state history, according the National Alliance on Mental Health. “With few exceptions, state legislatures acknowledged the need [to] increase or maintain mental-health appropriations or enact legislation,” the group said in its 2013 State Legislation Report. Many of the increases are related to efforts to comply with mental-health provisions in ObamaCare that start next year. And much of the legislation enacted this year was to expand the state-federal Medicaid program under the law because it is essential in paying and providing coverage for the estimated 2.7 million uninsured Americans affected by mental illness, the report states. Oregon, for example, increased its 2014-15 budget by roughly 22 percent to comply with the president’s signature health care law. The group argues that timing also played a factor in the increases, particularly the White House’s response to the Sandy Hook shootings -- in which 20 students and six adults were fatally shot. And that the mass shooting happened right before state legislative sessions started. The White House called for widespread changes including tighter school security and increased background checks on gun buyers. However, the NAMI argued the vast majority of people with mental illness is “no more violent than the general population” and called for providers of mental-health care to do a better job of complying with exist standards when reporting dangerous behavior related to gun ownership. The report points out that mental-health advocates warned that the “avalanche” of state legislation could result in Americans not seeking mental-health care and that changes could threaten civil liberties. Among the changes cited was the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, one of the first bills enacted in 2013 that increased the responsibilities of providers to turn over mental health records as related to gun sales. Similar SAFE acts were enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee. The report also points out Alaska and North Carolina reduced their mental health budgets. The Obama administration last month announced the final executive order of 23 that the president signed in January, while Congress has not come through in efforts to keep guns out the hands of people who are mentally ill and dangerous. One change is mental health patients can now get immediate emergency room care, like somebody with a broken bone, without having to get pre-approval from their insurance company. ""Imagine what it would mean if people felt as comfortable saying they were going for counseling as they do saying they're going for a flu shot or physical therapy,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in announcing the change. Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before the president signed the executive orders that he didn’t know whether an assault weapons ban could pass the Senate but thought a bill to improved background checks and related ones could pass. ""There are some who say nothing will pass,” he said. “I disagree with that. What I'm interested in is what we can get.""

X OUR PICKS: TAMPA, Fla.—The Florida family of a woman slain during the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard is the first to file a lawsuit against the government and defense contractors, alleging that officials ignored red flags about the killer’s deteriorating mental health. The suit on behalf of the family of Mary DeLorenzo Knight was filed Wednesday morning in federal court in Tampa. The lawsuit named the Navy, the Department of Veterans Affairs and two defense contractors as defendants. It’s seeking at least $37.5 million in damages. “We’re all just torn apart,” said Patricia DeLorenzo, the sister of the victim. “We just want to get through this.” Mary DeLorenzo Knight was one of 12 people killed by Aaron Alexis on Sept. 16 before he was killed in a shootout with police. The lawsuit said the contractor that Alexis worked for should have told the Navy about his prior, and documented, mental health problems and that the Navy should not have given him security clearance. Navy officials have said they found no record that the company alerted the Navy about his mental health. The lawsuit said the VA failed to treat his mental illness when Alexis went to a VA emergency room Aug. 23 for insomnia and detailed three arrests involving Alexis and his post-traumatic stress disorder, anger management problems and alcohol abuse. A VA spokesman said Wednesday it does no comment on pending litigation. A Navy spokeswoman said the Navy remains committed to providing continued support to the victims and families through its Washington Navy Yard Recovery Task Force but referred The Associated Press to the U.S. Department of Justice for comment about ongoing litigation. An email sent to the Department of Justice seeking comment wasn’t immediately answered. The company that employed the Washington Navy Yard shooter, Fort Lauderdale-based The Experts, pulled his access to classified material for two days in August when mental health problems became evident, but restored it quickly and never told Navy officials about the withdrawal. An initial Navy review revealed that The Experts ordered Alexis, a computer contractor, back to Washington, D.C., after a police incident in Rhode Island in August, according to senior U.S. officials. The company then withdrew his ability to access secret-level data for two days, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation. It did not disclose why his access was reinstated. Less than six weeks later, the former Navy reservist gunned down 12 civilian workers in a Navy Yard building, and police fatally shot him. The Experts did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Sidney Matthew, the Tallahassee, Fla.-based attorney for the DeLorenzo family, said that while officials ignored problems about Alexis’ mental health, the Navy could have stopped the shooting by requiring everyone to walk through a metal detector prior to entering the Navy Yard. He said he hopes that this lawsuit will spur the Navy and other branches of the military to install such detectors. “Mary DeLorenzo Knight’s life needs to stand for something,” he said. “We want change.” ——— Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Follow @TIME Updated Dec. 15, 2013, 10:07 a.m. The student who opened fire at a Colorado school Friday and wounded another student intended to harm more people before killing himself, police said. Karl Halverson Pierson was armed with a shotgun he purchased legally, a machete, three explosive devices and extra ammunition when he entered Arapahoe High School, Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said, according to the Associated Press. He fired six shots off a pump-action gun, directly hitting 17-year-old Claire Esther Davis before turning the gun on himself, all just 80 seconds after he arrived at the school. “His intent was evil,” Robinson said. “And his evil intent was to harm multiple individuals.” Pierson, a member of the school’s debate team, was possibly seeking retribution against the school’s debate coach, who was also the librarian. He was disciplined in September by his target, though the reason remains under investigation. Pierson also threatened the debate coach in September. “[Pierson] was very outspoken — always involved with class discussion,” a fellow student told NBC News. “So it was kind of odd to see that he was the one who did this.” “He had very strong beliefs about gun laws and stuff. I also heard he was bullied a lot,” another student told The Denver Post. On Friday, when the shooting began, students quickly alerted the librarian, who made a “wise tactical decision” to leave the building to lure the shooter away from other students, Robinson said. The shotgun Pierson carried was purchased legally from a local store on Dec. 6. The ammunition was purchased on the day of the shooting. Davis, likely caught in the crossfire and not a specific target, has severe head trauma remains in critical condition. Arapahoe County is where the Aurora movie theater shooting took place last year, when a gunman opened fire during a late-night movie premiere and killed 12 people. Arapahoe County High School is only about eight miles west of Columbine High School, the site of one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history in 1999. The latest shooting took place just one day before Saturday’s one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school.

BuzzFeed News Reporter Former Arizona Congresswoman Giffords and her husband, retired NASA astronaut and U.S. Navy captain Mark Kelly, launched Americans for Responsible Solutions following the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Dec. 2012. A year earlier, Giffords was shot in the head during mass shooting in Tucson, Ariz. on January 8, 2011 that killed six people, and wounded 12 others. In a statement released one day before the anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, Kelly pointed to Congress's inaction on gun violence since the tragedy: In the weeks after Newtown, we heard politician after politician give eloquent speeches—promising that they would keep our communities safe. They promised that they would honor the dead in Newtown. Congress held hearings and the atmosphere seemed ripe for action. Two Senators from both sides of the aisle came together and proposed a pragmatic bill that would require background checks on more gun purchases. The Senate came very close to passing it—but in the end, they failed to approve a solution that 90% of Americans support. The Senate, it seemed, was in the grip of the gun lobby.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. NEWTOWN, Conn.  – The 911 recordings from the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school last year will be released to the public Wednesday, town officials said Monday. A Connecticut Superior Court judge ruled last week that the tapes from the massacre in Newtown should be released to The Associated Press after a lengthy fight over the records, which investigators have withheld. State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, the lead investigator of the shooting, raised several arguments to shield the recordings that were rejected first by Connecticut's Freedom of Information Commission, which ruled in favor of the AP in September, and then the judge who ordered their release. Judge Eliot Prescott said last week the tapes would remain sealed until Wednesday to give Sedensky a chance to appeal. Sedensky declined to comment Monday. The tapes will be available Wednesday at a law office in Danbury, according to the statement released by Newtown's first selectman's office. The gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on the morning of Dec. 14 and gunned down 20 children and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He also killed his mother in their Newtown home before driving to the school. The AP has sought the recordings in part to examine the police response to the massacre. The AP will review the content and determine what, if any, of it would meet the news cooperative's standards for publication. In his ruling last week, Prescott denied a request by Sedensky for a stay of the FOI commission's ruling as he appeals that order. Prescott said the release of the tapes will help the public gauge the appropriateness of law enforcement's response. ""Delaying the release of the audio recordings, particularly where the legal justification to keep them confidential is lacking, only serves to fuel speculation about and undermine confidence in our law enforcement officials,"" the judge wrote.

The Bushmaster XM-15 assault riflePhoto courtesy of <a href=""http://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/xm-15.asp"">Bushmaster</a>  Last December, four days after Adam Lanza murdered 20 first graders and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, Cerberus Capital Management pledged to sell the Freedom Group, the company that manufactured the Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that Lanza used. The announcement helped tamp down a rising PR disaster for the Manhattan private equity firm, placating major investors such as the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which had said it was “examining” its $750 million stake in Cerberus after the massacre. The New York Times described the move as “a rare instance of a Wall Street firm bending to concerns about an investment’s societal impact.” A year after the Newtown tragedy, however, Cerberus has not sold Freedom Group (also known as Remington Outdoor Company Inc.), the nation’s largest firearms and ammunition conglomerate. After buyers failed to materialize early this year, Cerberus CEO Stephen Feinberg announced he and a small group of individuals would seek to buy the company, which also owns brands such as Remington, Marlin, and Dakota Arms. But in July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Feinberg was dropping his bid amid increasingly attractive offers from outside investors. “Cerberus initially planned to seek around $1 billion for the company,” the Journal reported, citing an anonymous source, “but now wants more.” Business has boomed for Freedom Group in the year since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary. Between January and the end of September, the company raked in $94 million in profits on more than $1 billion in gun and ammo sales, compared with just $500,000 in net profits during the same period in 2012. For the full year ending December 31, Freedom Group estimates that its net sales will be up 34 percent to $1.25 billion, according to a financial disclosure (PDF) released Monday.  Though Freedom Group doesn’t release sales figures specifically for the Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle, that weapon and similar models reportedly flew off retailers’ shelves in the weeks after Sandy Hook, snatched up by firearms enthusiasts who feared the guns would soon be outlawed. According to the Freedom Group’s third quarter report, this year’s earnings spike came primarily from a $42 million bump in sales of “centerfire rifles,” a category which includes the XM-15. The report further notes that Freedom Group’s leading sellers were “modern sporting rifles”—the firearms industry’s euphemism for assault weapons. “Consumer concern over more restrictive governmental regulation on the federal, state, and local levels has contributed to this increase in demand,” the report says. The company would have sold even more guns, the report adds, if not for “sales demand being greater than our current production capacity in many categories.” “We wish that this anniversary were not coming and that we were not holding Freedom Group,” said Mike Sicilia, a spokesman for CalSTRS, adding that the teachers pension fund is prohibited by its investment contract with Cerberus from discussing financial details. “It’s difficult on all of us because we represent the futures of teachers. Teachers were killed at Sandy Hook, and that gun was made by a company that we partially own. We all feel that.” Sicilia suggested that withdrawing its large investment from Cerberus is a complicated matter, and is not the pension fund’s preference. CalSTRS believes Cerberus “has made a good-faith effort to sell the company and will find a buyer,” he said. In announcing its plans to sell the Freedom Group last December, Cerberus distanced itself from the brewing fight over gun control. “As a Firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,” said a Cerberus’ press release. Our role is to make investments on behalf of our clients…It is not our role to take positions or attempt to shape or influence the gun policy debate. That is the job of our federal and state legislators.” But the same cannot be said for the company it controls, whose ties to the most powerful gun lobbying group are clear.  In May, the National Rife Association inducted three Freedom Group executives—CEO George Kollitides, Vice Chairman Wally McLallen, and President Scott Blackwell—into its “Golden Ring of Freedom,” a group who’ve given the NRA at least $1 million. “Beyond the business world, [Kollitides] has made important contributions to conservation efforts and the gun rights movement,” Tyler Schropp, the head of the NRA’s major gifts department, said in a video honoring the new inductees. And as Mother Jones first reported last January, Kollitides has sat on the NRA’s exclusive nine-member nominating committee, which closely controls who can be elected to the NRA board. Judging from the fortunes of similar publicly traded gun companies, selling the Freedom Group in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre would have meant leaving a lot of money on the table. In the three days following the shooting, for instance, the stock of Smith & Wesson, which also makes assault rifles, fell by 20 percent. Yet after the collapse of national gun control legislation this spring, Smith & Wesson shares quickly recovered, closing in August at their highest price since before the 2007 financial meltdown. Cerberus’s failure to divest from the Freedom Group as its gun sales have soared suggests to some gun-control advocates that Cerberus hasn’t been a motivated seller. “It’s a concern,” says Jennifer Fiore, the executive director of Campaign to Unload, a coalition of some 30 education and gun control associations organized by New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio. “It leads one to question whether they are negotiating in good faith.” Cerberus did not respond to requests for comment. But according to a report in the New York Times on Monday, the company now says it has a plan to offer concerned investors like CalSTRS a way out with “an interim step”: It will allow them to sell their stakes in Cerberus to a third-party investor, which will take a minority stake in Freedom Group and provide about $200 million in debt financing. The deal would value Freedom Group at about $1.2 billion. On Monday, Campaign to Unload, religious leaders, and gun violence victims held a vigil outside Cerberus’ Manhattan headquarters aimed at pressuring it further to divest from Freedom Group. “Half measures from Cerberus Capital Management are not enough,” Fiore said in a press release. “As principal owner of one of the most toxic products in America, Cerberus and its CEO, Stephen Feinberg, have an ethical imperative to unequivocally divest from Freedom Group.”  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Follow @TIMEPolitics Pacing the stage in a dark suit and no tie, the man who led the effort to legalize gay marriage in Washington laid out his next crusade to the nearly 200 grassroots activists gathered at the Seattle Center Pavilion Wednesday. “We here in Washington have a history of leading the country from software and coffee to marriage equality and environmental stewardship,” Zach Silk told the crowd. “Acting together, we can stand up to the gun lobby and change the conversation in the country.” Silk, who heads the gun control group Washington Alliance for Gun Responsibility, then outlined a path to passing a ballot initiative next November that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Making good on his words will be a tall order. Almost one year after 20 children and six adults were murdered in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the momentum it created to tighten America’s gun laws has led to few changes in policy. A federal effort to expand background checks on gun purchasers failed in Congress. Of the 109 state laws passed in the last year, only 39 tightened gun restrictions and 70 actually loosened them, according to a New York Times analysis. Just a handful of states–most solidly blue—enacted new gun control measures. “We’ve probably seen more thrown at us this year then in the whole history of the debate,” says Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, a gun rights organization in Seattle. “In some of the blue states we lost some ground, but in the red states we gained more ground.” Even hard-won victories led to setbacks for gun control advocates. Swing state Colorado narrowly passed tighter gun control legislation—only to see two state legislators recalled in a special election pushed by gun rights groups and another resign rather than face the same fate. As if in tacit acknowledgment that gun control is all but dead this legislative session, the White House marked the Sandy Hook anniversary this week by pledging $100 million to bolster mental health services. The statement made no mention of legislation to expand background checks or curb assault weapons, which had been the focus a year ago. Public opinion, meanwhile, is shifting. Support for stricter gun control has faded from a high of 58% right after the Sandy Hook shooting to 49% in October, according to Gallup. That span includes several other mass shootings, including one in September at the Washington D.C. Navy Yard that claimed a dozen lives. Despite the cooling public opinion and legislative setbacks, gun control advocates argue Newtown has reignited the movement and taught them important strategic lessons. “This has been the biggest year on passing new gun laws than any year in the past two decades, including after Columbine. A lot has happened,” says Arkadi Gerney, who works on gun control for the Center for American Progress, a progressive Washington think tank. “There’s a growing, stronger movement. The progress that’s happening will eventually reach Washington.” The collapse of federal background check legislation has led supporters to focus on local efforts. “I understand the pundits say that not enough got done this year, but next year is going to be even bigger,” says Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which formed in response to the Sandy Hook shooting. The group has since launched in all 50 states, modeling itself after Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Next year, the group is considering pushing a measure in a number of yet-to-be-determined southern and mountain states to charge parents or guardians of children who accidentally shoot themselves or others with criminal negligence for not locking up their firearms. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is working to establish himself as a counterweight to the powerful National Rifle Association, has said he plans on spending $12 million against anti-gun control candidates in the run up to next year’s election. And Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a nonprofit founded by Bloomberg and other urban mayors, is currently looking at around 12 states in 2014 where they will push legislation or initiatives on background checks, domestic violence and guns, better reporting of mental health records and expanding the class of prohibited purchasers. These efforts will be aided by a new ally. Organizing for Action, President Obama’s grassroots advocacy group, largely sat out the federal background check debate because they were unprepared to launch a new effort so soon after the 2012 election. Now, OFA is working in communities across the U.S. to drum up support for changes to local, state and federal laws. The electoral efforts paid off in November when Democrat Mark Herring won Virginia’s tight attorney general race. Kevin O’Holleran, Herring’s campaign manager, credits OFA’s work and direct mail and TV advertising by political action committees affiliated with Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords for pushing his candidate over the top in a state that is home to the N.R.A. Still, activists know the quick path is gone and the road ahead is long and complicated. At least in Washington, though, Silk is convinced that gun control will be easier to achieve than gay marriage was. “When we were in those fights we were always at a very bare majority, there are a lot of conflicted voters out there on gay equality,” Silk says. “It is very well resolved what to do on gun control and that is only being blocked by a well financed minority.” A recent statewide poll found that 81% of Washington residents favor expanded background checks. Despite such support, Democrats last year blocked a background check bill from even coming to a vote in the legislature for fear of political repercussions from the gun lobby. Silk’s challenge is the one faced by gun control advocates across the country: turn public support into political action, something the movement has largely failed to do.",2013-12-13 10:50:23,Gun-Control Activists Want a Reboot,,40362,http://www.time.com/time/

News By Associated Press Submit December 16, 2013 | 2:19pm WASHINGTON — The FBI has helped to disrupt or prevent nearly 150 shootings and violent attacks this year, in part by steering potential gunmen toward mental health professionals. There have been hundreds of these disruptions since 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder told an audience of police chiefs in October, touting the behind-the-scenes work of a small FBI unit based out of Quantico, Va. In most cases, the FBI has helped potential offenders get access to mental health care. Preventing mass shootings through threat assessments and treatment is an unusual tactic for an agency known for its crime fighting and not for interventions. The achievement stands out during a time when President Barack Obama made curbing gun violence a priority for his administration, yet has had very little success. One year after the deadly mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, the White House’s biggest efforts to curb gun violence — attempts to reinstate the assault weapons ban and expand background checks for all gun purchases — failed without congressional support. Mass shootings like the rampages in Newtown, Conn., the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard and the Aurora, Colo., movie theater do not represent the majority of gun violence. Yet when they do occur, the impact is high. And many times there’s the question of whether the shooter had adequate mental health treatment to prevent it from happening. Yet, in the national discourse about reducing gun violence, mental health treatment has received much less attention than banning assault weapons. The FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, for years, has been working with state and local authorities to profile potential offenders with the goal of preventing violent crimes like mass shootings. The “prevented” shootings and violent attacks from January through November of this year represent 148 cases that a division of that unit, the Behavioral Threat Assessment Center, has conferred on during 2013. And that number is up 33 percent from 2012, Andre Simmons, unit chief of the center, said in an interview with The Associated Press. In the past year, this unit has received about three new cases a week referred by federal, state, local and campus law enforcement, schools, businesses and houses of worship, Simmons said. The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center gets involved when someone notifies law enforcement, for example, about some troubling behavior, and law enforcement reaches out to the center to help assess the situation. “The people around that subject often become fearful that that outcome is catastrophic act of violence, such as an active shooting or some type of mass attack,” Simmons said. The center is staffed by agents and analysts of the FBI, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives and a psychiatrist. It helps the local officials assess the threat the person of concern poses. And then the center recommends how to proceed. Depending how far along the person is on the “pathway to violence,” Simmons said, the center makes recommendations based on the specific case. The recommendations could be arrest, if the person is involved in illegal activity, but most often, it’s getting that person access to mental health care, he said. As an example, Simmons referred to a case his unit consulted on a few years back. There was a man at a university who began to display bizarre behaviors coupled with an increasing interest in firearms, Simmons said. This man created a makeshift shooting range in the basement of his home where he lived with roommates, and he used pictures of the roommates as bull’s-eyes for target practice. He also was involved in animal abuse, Simmons said, and he was making statements that were troubling. Collecting firearms and target practice are not illegal activities, but the roommates feared for their safety. So they alerted university authorities, Simmons said. The university reached out to the FBI behavioral analysts and worked with them to develop a strategy. Working with mental health officials and campus police, a “caretaking” interview was arranged with the man, Simmons said. And that meeting resulted in a voluntary admission to a psychiatric facility. “Once in that facility, he was deemed to be of such compromised state, that it turned into an involuntary evaluation,” Simmons said. “And the attending physician noted as well that it was not really a question of if he would attack, but when, given the statements that he made and the thoughts he was disclosing.” The FBI would not provide specific details of this case or others they’ve consulted on because many are ongoing and involve people who have not been charged with crimes. The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center operates with the knowledge that mass shootings like Newtown are uncommon, and that’s important, said Ronald Schouten, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and expert on threat assessments. “These occur very rarely, and there’s no profile,” Schouten said of those who carry out the shootings. The center was launched in the fall of 2010. The unit’s existence is not yet common knowledge around the country. But awareness is growing, as the FBI has recently been sponsoring two-day conferences about the threat of active shooters, Simmons said. Having a mental illness does not mean that a person is predisposed to violent behavior, Simmons said. So a person’s history and surroundings are an important part of assessing the threat. “And we recognize that for many individuals, the coping strategies may be overwhelmed and they may lose the ability to see an alternative to violence,” he said. One year ago, a 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and massacred 20 children and six women with a semi-automatic rifle. He also killed his mother in their Newtown home before driving to the school. He committed suicide as police arrived at the scene, and authorities still do not know his motive. Since the shooting, Lanza has been described as “troubled.” Investigators said his fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances. After that tragedy, Obama spoke to the nation about reducing gun violence. “We’re going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,” he said five days after the deadly shooting. The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center has not been promoted by the White House as one of its major efforts to reduce gun violence. Instead, it’s continued the behind-the-scenes work it’s been doing for the past three years. And referrals keep coming in.

(Jay Janner, Austin American Statesman file photo via AP) WASHINGTON -- A Senate vote to renew an expiring ban on plastic firearms capable of evading metal detectors and X-ray machines is shaping up as a bittersweet moment for gun control supporters, days before the anniversary of the deadly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Monday's vote to extend the prohibition on plastic guns for another decade responds to a growing threat from steadily improving 3-D printers that can produce such weapons. But gun control advocates seem sure to lose an effort to impose additional, tougher restrictions on plastic firearms -- a harsh reminder of their failure to enact any new federal gun curbs in the year since 20 first-graders and six educators were murdered in Newtown, Conn. The slayings last Dec. 14 prompted the newly re-elected President Barack Obama to push gun control to the top of his domestic agenda. But Congress approved nothing, and gun control advocates face the same uphill struggle in 2014, complicated by internal divisions over what their next step should be. ""The gun lobby still has enormous power in Washington -- more, frankly, than I thought they still had,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who represented Newtown last year while in the House. Illustrating the roadblocks that have thwarted gun control forces, an effort by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to make plastic guns more detectable by requiring them to have a permanent metal part seems certain to fail Monday. His plan is opposed by Republicans and the National Rifle Association. The Senate is then expected to easily approve a 10-year extension of the ban, which would otherwise expire Tuesday. Schumer and other Democrats, as well as gun-control advocates and law enforcement officials, say there's a problem with current law on plastic guns: It lets gun makers meet its requirements by including a metal part that can be easily detached -- thus letting the weapon evade screening devices. In a statement last week, the NRA expressed no opposition to renewing the law. But the gun lobby said it would fight any expanded requirements, including Schumer's ""or any other proposal that would infringe on our Second Amendment rights"" to bear arms. The prohibition was first enacted in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan and easily renewed twice. The House approved a 10-year extension of the ban last Tuesday. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, says that with the law's expiration at hand, Congress should quickly enact a long extension and study Schumer's plan later. Other Republicans agree. Supporters of tightening the rules say the 10-year renewal plays into the NRA's hands because it reduces Democrats' ability to revisit the issue. If, as expected, Democrats fail Monday to tighten the restrictions, it will be the latest in a series of setbacks this year. Their biggest defeat came in April, when the Senate blocked an effort to expand required background checks for firearms buyers. The proposal was Obama's top gun-control priority following the elementary school killings. Background checks, aimed at preventing criminals and the mentally ill from getting weapons, are currently required only for purchases from licensed gun dealers. The rejected bill, by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., would have extended the requirement to all guns bought on the Internet and at gun shows. Also rejected in April were proposals to ban assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines, which have been used in mass shootings. House Republican leaders never favored any of those proposals, and none came to a vote there. But with Saturday's Newtown anniversary drawing attention to the issue, Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., a psychologist, plans to announce legislation Thursday aimed at bolstering federal mental health programs, including treatment, research and training for workers who respond to emergencies. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has gained none of the five new votes he would need to prevail on background checks. Eager to avoid exposing potentially vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election next year to politically fraught votes, Reid has said he won't revisit the issue until he can win. That has left gun control groups split over strategy. Some want to pursue more modest improvements like strengthening mental health programs and broadening the scope of reports that states provide to the federal background check system. Groups backing this approach include some Newtown families and Americans for Responsible Solutions, formed by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., seriously wounded by a mass shooter, and her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. ""We see only good coming from passing mental health legislation around which there is broad bipartisan agreement,"" said a statement from Sandy Hook Promise, a group representing some Newtown families. ""If we don't begin to bury at least some of our differences, we will continue to needlessly bury our children."" Others want to continue raising pressure on lawmakers to back strong background check requirements, and oppose settling for less. These groups include Mayors Against Illegal Guns, led by outgoing New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, which has been spending money against gun-rights congressional candidates and lawmakers. They fear Republicans would use votes for weaker efforts to cast themselves as having championed major steps against guns. ""Our interest in giving (New Hampshire GOP Sen.) Kelly Ayotte a vote on a mental health bill, which would be a good bill but do virtually nothing to solve the gun violence problem in this country, approaches zero,"" said Mark Glaze, the mayors' group executive director.

Follow @TIME Bells rang out 26 times in Newtown, Conn. Saturday, in remembrance of the number of lives that were taken a year ago in one of the nation’s deadliest school shootings. Each victim’s name was read aloud as the bell was struck during a haunting memorial service at a church, the Associated Press reports. The community, which asked the nation for privacy to mark the one-year anniversary, hosted several religious services throughout the town to honor the 20 children and six educators killed at Sandy Hook Elementary one year ago. President Barack Obama used his weekly radio address to urge Americans to put a stop to future violence, just one day after a Colorado student opened fire on his Denver suburb high school, injuring one before killing himself. “We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and valued, and cared for,” Obama said. He also observed a moment of silence and lit candles at the White House to remember the tragedy. In an effort to keep the day a private mourning for friends and family of the victims, Newtown officials did not host any formal memorial events. Newtown is still grieving over last year’s tragedy, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza killed his mother at their Newtown home before his elementary school massacre.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill, File) NEWTOWN, Conn. -- President Barack Obama called on the nation to help prevent future violence in an address released on Saturday's anniversary of the school shooting in Newtown, which planned a day of quiet reflection with private memorial services and the ringing of bells for the victims. Obama said in his radio address that the massacre of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School will be remembered as a tragedy that inspired the nation to make communities safer. ""We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and valued, and cared for,"" said Obama, who also planned to observe a moment of silence at the White House in honor of the victims. Newtown officials have called for privacy and asked town residents to honor the victims through acts of service and kindness. At a joint appearance during the week in Newtown, some of the victims' families urged people to find ways to give back to their own communities. ""In this way, we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,"" JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was killed at Sandy Hook. The town had no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown. ""We are trying to respect the world's interest in us, but we also have a real need in our community to gain a foothold,"" First Selectman Pat Llodra said. The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside their Newtown home on Dec. 14, 2012, before driving to the school, where he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived. At St. Rose of Lima, the Roman Catholic church that hosted the funerals of eight children, a service will include the dedication of a memorial arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

(MLive file photo) MUSKEGON, MI - The last night of operation of the Charity Lodge #1397 likely will be Saturday night, Sept. 21 and early morning hours of Sept. 22. The social club at 149 Ottawa St. was the scene of a mass shooting that left three dead and four others wounded shortly after 2 a.m. that Sunday morning. Michigan Liquor Control and city of Muskegon officials have made sure that the club did not reopen as the city moved to revoke the Charity Lodge's ""club"" liquor license and city business registration license. The Muskegon City Commission unanimously voted to accept the recommendation of neutral hearing officer Robert Chessman, a Muskegon trail attorney asked to conduct a Dec. 2 fact-finding hearing and provide a recommendation. The commission action to revoke the state liquor license will be sent on to the LCC for its verification of the public hearing and decision of the commission. City Attorney John Schrier said it is his belief that with a proper hearing and commission resolution, the LCC will accept the city's request and revoke the liquor license. As for the business registration, Chessman also recommended that City Manager Frank Peterson revoke the city's business registration. Schrier said the city manager will be sending the Charity Lodge a letter declaring its business license is revoked, thus permanently closing the club. Charity Lodge Exalted Leader Jethro Gay Jr. of Muskegon attended the commission meeting Tuesday, Dec. 10 and was asked if he'd like to make a statement prior to the vote. Gay declined and also had no comment after the decision. Chessman's recommendation was based upon the events of Sept. 22 in the area outside of the Charity Lodge and a string of police calls at the club stretching back to 2003. He concluded the club could not control the situation at its establishment and failed to call police about situations in the club that night that spilled outside where three 20-year-olds died. ""It is just unacceptable,"" said Commissioner Willie German Jr. of the events at the Charity Lodge. ""With the ownership of a liquor license comes responsibility. I went to the club when I was younger, but it seems times have changed. To keep our youth safe, we have to make tough decisions."" Vice Mayor Larry Spataro said that the club has an honorable history and has done plenty of positive things in the community over the years. But he said the ""underage drinking, violence and death"" will not be tolerated in the city. After the vote, Diane Foster, owner and operator of a next-door medical marijuana business, thanked the city commission for its action. ""I am sorry to see the club go, as for three years we worked together on kids' giveaways and things,"" Foster told commissioners. ""In the last year, something dramatically changed and I am sorry. I have heard some say that this was the best place for kids to go."" Commissioner Eric Hood took exception with the comment, adding he voted to revoke the licenses because he found the process to be fair. ""The club was never intended for kids,"" Hood said. ""It is an adult club for adult membership. If we are sending our kids to the club to party with adults, then we have to take a look at ourselves at parents.""

47,http://nypost.com/2013/12/02/documentary-marks-20th-anniversary-of-lirr-massacre/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Entertainment By Tim Donnelly Submit December 2, 2013 | 8:14am If Robert Giugliano could go back to the courtroom where he stared down Colin Ferguson, the man who shot him in the chest during the infamous Long Island Rail Road shooting of 1993, he’d do one thing differently. “I would have taken the shot and jumped on him and hit him,” said Giugliano, who created a minor spectacle during the case by yelling at Ferguson, who was representing himself in the trial. “I was angered. I just couldn’t just walk out of that courtroom.” Giugliano’s outburst, the rest of the intensely emotional and chilling trial, along with the details of the shooting itself are returning to televisions this week for the Investigation Discovery documentary, “Terror on a Train,” premiering Wednesday at 10 p.m. It’s the 20th anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1993 horror that killed six and injured 19 others in one of America’s first mass shootings. The anniversary was one reason the filmmakers and victims were inspired to do the documentary; the ongoing gun violence and increasing number of mass shootings was the other. “It’s a memorial for my husband who should not have died this way, and I know what it’s like to go through this,” says Joyce Gorycki, whose husband James was shot to death on the train. “ I’ll do everything I can do to change the [gun] laws. I’ll do it until the day I die.” The incident was a huge story at the time, thanks to the severity of the quick massacre and the courtroom circus that followed. Ferguson opened fire on a rush hour train as it pulled into Merillon Avenue station, creating two minutes of chaos and bloodshed. Later at the trial, he fired his own defense team and insisted on representing himself, creating a haunting and emotional scene as he cross-examined his own victims. “He wanted the world to hear his voice,” says Charlie Minn, the director of the film who was living on Long Island at the time of the shooting and was friends with Mi Kyung Kim, one of the people killed. “He knew he was going to jail and this was his way of getting his last licks in before he went.” Minn reached out to Ferguson through letters to see if he would appear in the documentary, but Ferguson — who is serving 315 years for second degree murder — never responded. That’s OK for Minn, because he wanted to focus on the victims’ stories, not the madman behind them. “If we stop giving these mass murders their 15 minutes of fame i think we’d see less of these shootings,” he says. The film “gives the victims a voice. At the end of the day, we always know the killer’s name; we don’t know the victims name.” Gorycki got heavily involved in gun control groups after the shooting as chair of the Long Island chapter of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. She’s also helped the victims keep in touch with each other: they exchange Christmas card and get together for memorials. For the 20th anniversary, they’re gathering for dinner at Eleanor Rigby’s, a restaurant two blocks away from the Merillon Avenue station. Giugliano has physically recovered from the shooting, but he’s still emotionally affected. Recently, his granddaughter was born on Dec. 7, giving him something else to think about on that day. But every time another mass shooting hits the news, he feels new pain. “I don’t turn the TV off. I look at it, I watch it,” he says. “I got to live with it every day.” Read Next Olympic-themed memorial highlights TLC's 'Best Funeral Eve... Share Selection This story has been shared 40,285 times.

If you value Mother Jones' reporting and you can right now, please help us close that gap with a donation today.  In testimony given a few weeks after the mass shooting in Newtown, gun rights lobbyist Gayle Trotter emphasized to US senators that the best way for women to keep themselves and their children safe was to be armed. “An assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon,” she said. In terms of danger to children, Trotter couldn’t have been more wrong. According to our latest investigation, in the past year at least 194 kids ages 12 and under were killed by guns, in towns and cities across 43 states. And the vast majority of them were killed in homes—127 in their own, and another 30 in the homes of relatives, friends, or neighbors. In 39 cases, children were shot intentionally in their own homes by their parents or adult guardians, accounting for more than a third of the 103 total homicides. And out of 84 total accidental shooting deaths, at least 49 involved kids handling a firearm left unsecured inside a home. Moreover, when it comes to the accidental gun deaths of children, adults are rarely held criminally responsible. In 72 cases in which a child or teen pulled the trigger, killing themselves or other kids, we found only 4 cases in which an adult was convicted. (Charges may still be pending in some cases.) In part that may be because only 14 states and the District of Columbia have strong negligence laws with respect to children and firearms. See our special report. For more details, read the full story here. I also discussed the investigation on NPR’s All Things Considered, and you can listen here. One pediatrician I spoke with for this story noted that “Newtown concentrated the horror in one place.” But as the nation once again grieves the victims of that terrible day, it’s also important to remember these 194 kids, victims of the everyday toll. Their average age was 6. You can see more about them in this gallery:  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

With snow falling and homes decorated with Christmas lights, Newtown looked every bit the classic New England town, with a coffee shop and general store doing steady business. But reminders of the private grief were everywhere. ""God bless the families,"" read a sign posted at one house in the green and white colors of the Sandy Hook school, and a church posted that it was ""open for prayer."" Ryan Knaggs, a chef who lives in Newtown, said that as the bells tolled he thought of two young victims who played soccer with his 7-year-old daughter. ( Also on POLITICO: Post-Newtown view: 'It's my job to die') ""The echo of the bells, knowing some of the children personally, you feel the exactitude with each bell ... the exactitude of the loss and the grief,"" Knaggs said. The bells rang 26 times at St. Rose of Lima church in Newtown beginning at 9:30 a.m. — the moment the gunman shot his way into the school on Dec. 14, 2012 — and names of the victims were read over a loudspeaker. Connecticut's governor had asked for bells to ring across Connecticut and directed that flags be lowered to half-staff. In Washington, the president and first lady Michelle Obama lit 26 votive candles set up on a table in the White House Map Room — one each for the 20 children and six educators. In his weekly radio address released hours earlier, Obama said the nation hasn't done enough to make its communities safer by keeping dangerous people from getting guns and healing troubled minds. Gun restrictions backed by the president in response to the shooting faced stiff opposition and ultimately stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. ""We have to do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily. We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and valued, and cared for,"" Obama said. ( Also on POLITICO: Gun control battle moves to Main Street) Newtown asked for quiet and privacy on the anniversary. Satellite television trucks filled Newtown's streets in the days after the shooting, and media have often returned since to the community of 28,000 people for stories related to the attack. In an effort to keep the anniversary focused on quiet reflection, First Selectman E. Patricia Llodra announced in October that Newtown would not host any formal remembrance events. The news media were asked to keep their distance, and ""No Media"" signs went up around town as they did in the weeks after the tragedy. Some news organizations stayed away Saturday from Newtown. A reporter and photographer for The Associated Press, whose reports are available to media worldwide, were present in the community, and some townspeople were willing to share their thoughts. Andrew Snow, a mechanic who was drinking coffee at the general store with a friend, said it was an especially difficult day. ""You kind of hope the town can put it behind without actually forgetting about the victims,"" said Snow, who grew up in Newtown and is moving back from nearby Southbury to support the community. ""But it's not easy to do. I think about it every day."" The gunman, Adam Lanza, shot and killed his mother inside their Newtown home before driving to the school and took his own life as police arrived. Missing out on the latest scoops?

December 9, 2013 Newtown officials asked for privacy and joined victims' families Monday in calling for people to mark the upcoming anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by performing acts of kindness or volunteering with charities. Relatives of more than half the 26 victims said at a news conference that they planned to light a candle on Friday night in honor of their lost loved ones. They also urged people thinking of the victims to find ways to give back to their own communities. ""In this way, we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,"" said JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was among the 20 students and six educators shot to death in the school on Dec. 14, 2012. She was reading from a statement released by the families of all 26 victims. The town has no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown. ""We are trying to respect the world's interest in us, but we also have a real need in our community to gain a foothold,"" First Selectman Pat Llodra said. The families also announced they have set up a new website — http://mysandyhookfamily.org — where each family can share information on how they are honoring victims. ""In the midst of our grief we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts,"" said Krista Rekos, mother of 6-year old Jessica. ""We've been uplifted by the support of so many people, and we would like to keep that spirit of unity and love alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss."" The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside their Newtown home before driving to the school where he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived. The ""acts of kindness"" theme has been seized on by other officials, including Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal joined the United Way and others at an event Monday in New Britain in calling for a week of volunteer service in memory of those killed. Several memorial services are planned for the weekend in Newtown. At Saint Rose of Lima, the Roman Catholic church that hosted the funerals of eight children, the service will include the dedication of a memorial arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Rev. Robert Weiss said he planning to keep the church open 24 hours on the anniversary of the shooting, to give people a place to go and pray. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. ""I know that many people in the town are choosing just to be away,"" said Weiss, ""Not just the most impacted families, but several other families are just going to leave the area for the weekend.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize.

71,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sandy-541220-america-action.html,"Trending: I’ve known since late last December what I would be doing on Saturday. I knew I would hang my head low in mourning for the 20 first-graders and six educators massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary, in Newtown, Conn. But mourning would only be the half of it. I didn’t realize a year ago that I’d be spending Saturday talking about action. I became an “accidental activist” shortly after Sandy Hook, joining a new organization called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, where I found a framework for doing more than just wringing my hands about each new shooting. I have found a way to make my voice heard. Like so many moms across the nation – and dads, too – I describe Sandy Hook as my 9/11. It changed me. In all its atrocious detail, this mass execution of first-graders spurred me to action. But it’s what I have learned since that day that keeps me dedicated to the daily mission of stopping gun violence. In 2010, 2,694 children and teens in the United States died from gun violence, according to the Children’s Defense Fund’s 2013 report on data collected from the Centers for Disease Control and the National Center for Health Statistics. Nationally, guns kill twice as many children and young people as cancer, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. This is certainly not my idea of America. So I’m certainly not going to remain silent. Critics who say our movement hasn’t made gains this year are missing the point. Within the span of a year, we can’t undo the decades of bad firearms policy that has made America the runaway leader in gun deaths among industrialized nations. We have changed the conversation in America by making it clear that this is not a partisan political issue, but rather an alarming public health crisis that should concern every parent; that moms have every right to loudly demand solutions to this preventable epidemic; and that we’ll keep this issue alive. Sandy Hook was Day One, and it opened our eyes in such a jarring manner that we can never close them again. We are restless, but we are resolute. We are a gathering storm. After I hang my head low on Saturday, I will hold it high while demanding action. – Deborah Hernandez is a wife, mother, marketing communications professional, graduate of UC Irvine, and longtime Orange County resident. She serves on the statewide communications team for the California chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and founded its Orange County chapter in February.

X OUR PICKS: At last, the damage done by an agonizing global recession was easing. A bitter U.S. presidential election was finally over. And as 2013 began, it seemed the year might bring news headlines offering the public some reassurance or relief. The year started, after all, with an inauguration that held out the chance for at least a slight thaw in the nation’s political deepfreeze. The prospects were bolstered by economic tail winds that pushed unemployment to its lowest level in five years, lifted stocks to record highs and juiced home prices. News is never predictable, of course. But as 2013 unfolded, it seemed possible that a country worn by infighting, the toll of tough times and tragedy, might begin to find its stride. Instead, the year’s headlines were often filled with tales of dysfunction, discord and misplaced trust that added distressing new chapters to an already too-long narrative. At a time when many people say that the political system and societal institutions aren’t working, the news in 2013 provided multiple sources of confirmation, both at home and abroad. It was the year that things broke down—or at least it often left many people feeling that way. Those misgivings were validated when star cyclist Lance Armstrong and slugger Ryan Braun admitted their long, proud denials of doping were lies; by revelations of the warning signals authorities missed before the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, and missed chances to save lives after a mammoth typhoon hit the Philippines; by angry street protests in Turkey, Egypt and the Ukraine and even by a new pope who acknowledged the need to clean up the Vatican. But the dysfunction that often grabbed the headlines this year found its anchor in Washington, D.C., beginning almost immediately after President Barack Obama took the oath for his second term and a Congress supposedly mindful of the public’s dissatisfaction returned to the capital. For weeks, senators on both sides of the aisle spoke of a new willingness to come together on previously non-existent common ground and attempt to reform immigration laws. “We have an obligation and the need to address the reality that we face,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a leading voice in his party on immigration. “Now is the time,” Obama said days later. But after the Senate passed a comprehensive bill, efforts at reform stalled in the house, putting even piecemeal changes at least temporarily out of reach. At about the same time, with the grief of last December’s school shooting in Newtown, Conn. still fresh, the White House pushed forward on its pledge to bridge divisions and shepherd reforms to gun laws through Congress. But the more time passed the more likely it seemed that lawmakers might find nothing they could agree on, until even a push to compromise on expanded background checks for gun purchases that was widely supported by voters also failed. “Shame on you!” two women in the Senate gallery shouted out when the results of the vote were tallied, voicing a disgust with government that, by year’s end, became the one commonality among Americans who agreed on little else. It didn’t end there. Shadows were again cast over the government’s ability to act fairly and functionally when scandal enveloped the Internal Revenue Service over its intense scrutiny of conservative organizations. Later, it became clear, the agency had also screened liberal groups. Then, in June, Americans were confronted by disturbing new questions. Ever since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the public had largely accepted the proposition that entrusting government to keep society safe meant ceding some measure of privacy and convenience. Then, a previously unknown former National Security Agency contractor named Edward Snowden began leaking classified documents pointing to the government’s broad surveillance of not just potential foreign enemies, but also America’s allies and its own citizens. Still, while critics lambasted the NSA as a symbol of government unhinged, nobody questioned that the agency was at least working. By October, many Americans counting on government for more mundane services would have been grateful for such functionality. First, the Republican-controlled House refused to fund the government without cuts in spending or delays in Obama’s Affordable Care Act, resulting in a shutdown that cast a capital built on a swamp into a new morass of hot air and stagnation. The shutdown, and the coinciding worries about whether it might soon be repeated, dominated the news even as the debut of the health care overhaul it sought to derail went largely overlooked. But when lawmakers reopened the government after more than two weeks with little, if any, discernible gain, the spotlight turned on the workings of Obama’s signature law—the one that was supposed to demonstrate government’s singular ability to deliver change—and found it almost entirely out of order, feeding the public’s  broadening and deepening sense of distrust and dismay. This was the year, after all, when one Gallup poll found public confidence in Congress at the lowest level ever—not just for lawmakers, but for any institution on record. More than 85 percent of Americans surveyed by the Harris Poll this fall said the people running the country don’t really care what happens to them, up from 50 percent in 2010. And an AP-GfK Poll found nearly two-thirds of Americans expressed mistrust of one another, continuing a four-decade drain on what is arguably a necessary ingredient for effective democracy. No doubt, the country and the world have faced far more dire crises. But the trade-off of modern technology is that we now live in an information storm that, true to this year’s headlines, buffets us with repeated examples of institutional dysfunction, making misgivings self-confirming, said Sheila Suess Kennedy, author of “Distrust, American Style: Diversity and the Crisis of Public Confidence.” “We are marinating in an information society—sometimes a misinformation society—and I think it’s much harder for people to avoid,” says Kennedy, noting how the news this year fed distrust unimaginable just a few generations ago, when people were generally less aware of institutional misconduct. “I’m unwilling to say to you that life was simpler, but we thought it was simpler.” Certainly not all of the news of the past year was in that vein. After years of sanctions and threatening rhetoric, six world powers struck an interim deal with Iran limiting its nuclear activities. Federal officials, long faulted for not going after Wall Street firms, completed lengthy investigations that saw J.P. Morgan and SAC Capital ordered to pay huge fines. Even the federal government’s health care website began to function as the year neared an end. But that did not alleviate the continuing drumbeat of news that left the public to question, not just government, but also big business, major league sports and religious institutions. The new pope, Francis, spoke to some of those misgivings almost immediately after his elevation, naming panels to help reform the scandalized Vatican bank and overhaul the church’s tangled bureaucracy. But he also went a good deal further, embracing a message that has long been part of church doctrine, but addressing it as his priority: capitalism, itself, is broken, he said, warning against a culture that fosters “the globalization of indifference.” It was one more headline, one more reminder of modern society’s shortcomings, even as it spotlighted the continued struggle to make our highly imperfect institutions work. The benefits of that struggle were easy to lose sight of as a year full of frustrations neared an end. So perhaps it was fitting that one of the year’s last big new stories—the death of South Africa’s Nelson Mandela and the remembrances of the life he lived—reminded us that resolutions to even the most intractable crises can be found when society and its leaders begin by acknowledging the problems and their capacity to address them. “I don’t know, but there are not very many heads of state who would so easily say,’I’m sorry,'” said former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, recalling Mandela in a tribute days after his death. “And I hope that not only we, but our leaders, would emulate him.” ——— Adam Geller, a New York-based national writer, can be reached at features(at)ap.org or followed on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AdGeller .

She is in ""very critical condition,"" Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said Sunday.
Advertisement Davis, a 17-year-old senior at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, was shot in the head Friday by 18-year-old senior Karl Pierson, who fired several random rounds in a school hallway before shooting Davis. Robinson told reporters Davis appeared to have been a random victim. Seconds later, Pierson turned the gun on himself. Officers found his body in the school library. Robinson said Pierson had expressed threats against school librarian Tracy Murphy to other students and was targeting Murphy in the shooting. Murphy is also the debate coach. Murphy was able to safely leave the school, authorities said, a decision they said may have averted further violence. Pierson had stormed into the school shortly before 12:30 p.m. with a pump-action shotgun, a bandoleer of ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails. The school, 13 miles south of Denver, is also about 8 miles from Columbine High School, site of the April 1999 mass shooting by two 12th-grade students who killed 12 students and a teacher and injured 24 other students. It is also near the Aurora, Colo., movie theater where a gunman killed 12 people and shot 70 others in July 2012. Friday's shooting occurred a day before the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 schoolchildren and six adult staff members dead. Pierson bought the shotgun a week before the shooting and later bought the ammunition, as he was entitled to do under Colorado law, the sheriff said. Investigators have spoken with Murphy extensively and are beginning to understand the relationship between the two, Robinson told the Denver Post. ""We're beginning to better define that, but at this point in time it's not something we're going to talk about,"" Robinson told the newspaper. Robinson and Gov. John Hickenlooper credited the swift response by a deputy sheriff working as the school's resource officer during the shooting. ""This could have been much, much worse,"" Hickenlooper told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Hickenlooper said he also visited Davis and her family Sunday. ""We all have to keep Claire in our thoughts and prayers,"" he said. Robinson told reporters Sunday investigators had wrapped up their investigation and released control of the building back to the district at 6 a.m. Monday. The school, normally open for students to study before finals this week, will remain closed until after the New Year. Students would be allowed to return to school to pick up personal belongings Thursday or Friday, depending on what grade they are in, the principal said in an email to parents.",2013-12-16 06:44:16,Colorado student shooting victim in coma,"education and schools,murders and attempted murders,violence",1706,http://www.upi.com/

81,http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_24566465/west-oakland-gangsters-guilty-double-murder-2011-jack?source=rss,"Trending: OAKLAND — A pair of West Oakland gang members were found guilty of a double murder and more than a half-dozen attempted murders Wednesday for a 2011 mass shooting at a Jack London Square bar. It took the jury of nine women and three men about one day to find Clem Thompkins, 25, and Lamar Fox, 24, guilty of the 16 felony counts charged against them including gang enhancement allegations and a special circumstance enhancement for killing multiple people. The pair showed no reaction as the verdict was read in the courtroom of Alameda County Superior Court Judge Vernon Nakahara. Both will be sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole when they are sentenced in February. “Justice has been served,” said Prince Wilson, father of Adam Williams Jr., one of two men killed. “It won’t bring my son back, but it brings a sense of closure and justice to our family.” The shooting occurred just after midnight on April 25, 2011, when Fox got into an argument with a group of men standing at the front door of the now-defunct Sweet Jimmie’s Bar and Restaurant. As Fox was exchanging words and shoves with the men, Thompkins walked up with an assault rifle and started firing into the bar. Thompkins fired at least 10 shots killing Williams, 22, and Billy Jenkins, 26. Thompkins also shot five other revelers. The scene was described by many as a massacre and bloodbath. Fox and Thompkins arrived at Sweet Jimmie’s on a mission to find rival gang members. Fox and Thompkins belonged to a gang from the city’s Lower Bottoms neighborhood and were searching for gang members who lived in the Acorn housing project. The pair were looking for rivals after Fox had gotten into a verbal altercation near the bar earlier in the evening with a rival gang member during which the rival flashed a gun. Feeling disrespected, Fox and Thompkins decided to fight back and drove to Fox’s house, where they retrieved the assault rifle. When they returned to Jack London Square, Fox left the car and began searching for rivals as Thompkins sat in the car with the gun. At one point, Fox got into an argument with a group standing in front of Sweet Jimmie’s, and Thompkins then decided to jump out of the car and start shooting. None of the victims were gang members, and no evidence was presented that showed if any gang members were even at the bar. Attorneys representing the Fox and Thompkins blamed each other’s client for the shooting. Darryl Billups, Thompkins’ attorney, argued that Fox was the shooter and questioned the identification of his client by victims, saying they could not be trusted because of trauma the victims suffered. “I’m disappointed,” Billups said after the verdict. Meanwhile, Fox’s attorney, Deborah Levy, argued that her client should not be responsible for murder because he had no idea that Thompkins was going to starting “blasting” bullets into the bar. “There’s a difference between the guy who used the gun and the guy who didn’t,” Levy said. “It seems that just because Mr. Fox got into a verbal argument, he was found responsible for the crime.” But deputy district attorney Tim Wellman said that Fox is as responsible as Thompkins because Fox made the decision with Thompkins to hunt down rival gang members. Both defendants worked together, Wellman said, in getting the gun, and both planned on using that gun to shoot people. “These two defendants acted together and this would not have happened without both of them,” Wellman said. “I’m pleased the jury held them accountable for what they did.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2013-11-21 21:51:12,West Oakland gangsters guilty of double murder for 2011 Jack London Square bar shooting,"decisions and verdicts,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders,sentences (criminal),organized crime",35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

X OUR PICKS: NEWTOWN, Conn.—Newtown officials asked for privacy and joined victims’ families Monday in calling for people to mark the upcoming anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by performing acts of kindness or volunteering with charities. Relatives of more than half the 26 victims said at a news conference that they planned to light a candle on Friday night in honor of their lost loved ones. They also urged people thinking of the victims to find ways to give back to their own communities. “In this way, we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,” said JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was among the 20 students and six educators shot to death in the school on Dec. 14, 2012. She was reading from a statement released by the families of all 26 victims. The town has no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown. “We are trying to respect the world’s interest in us, but we also have a real need in our community to gain a foothold,” First Selectman Pat Llodra said. The families also announced they have set up a new website—http://mysandyhookfamily.org— where each family can share information on how they are honoring victims. “In the midst of our grief we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts,” said Krista Rekos, mother of 6-year old Jessica. “We’ve been uplifted by the support of so many people, and we would like to keep that spirit of unity and love alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss.” The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside their Newtown home before driving to the school where he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived. The “acts of kindness” theme has been seized on by other officials, including Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal joined the United Way and others at an event Monday in New Britain in calling for a week of volunteer service in memory of those killed. Several memorial services are planned for the weekend in Newtown. At Saint Rose of Lima, the Roman Catholic church that hosted the funerals of eight children, the service will include the dedication of a memorial arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Rev. Robert Weiss said he planning to keep the church open 24 hours on the anniversary of the shooting, to give people a place to go and pray. “I know that many people in the town are choosing just to be away,” said Weiss, “Not just the most impacted families, but several other families are just going to leave the area for the weekend. They don’t want their children subjected to reliving that day.” ———— Eaton-Robb reported from Hartford.

83,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/columnists/~3/2Ca1Phi9HlY/,"Trying to make ordinary sense out of these extraordinary crimes is fruitless—and ultimately only encourages more violence Lighted angels hang from a tree in Monroe, Connecticut, January 14, 2013, on the one-month anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary. Follow @TIMEIdeas Why did the Newtown shooter do it? This is the question to which the media and the public anxiously awaited an answer before yesterday’s release of a report by Connecticut investigators. The report itself even notes this interest, saying, “The obvious question that remains is: ‘Why did the shooter murder twenty-seven people, including twenty children?’” If we are looking for a reason to make sense of it all, the report leaves us disappointed—and the lack of motive figures in just about every headline covering yesterday’s report. But even looking for one is a futile act. (MORE: Sandy Hook Shooting: Video Games Blamed, Again) Here is what the report does find: The shooter had mental health problems, including social dysfunction, anxiety, lack of empathy, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. But the shooter’s actions cannot be explained away merely by mental illness: although he was troubled, he was not psychotic or insane. Rather, he “had the ability to control his behavior to obtain the results he wanted, including his own death.” There is overwhelming evidence that he acted intentionally and planned his actions carefully. He knew exactly what he was doing. Despite early speculation, there is little evidence that bullying or other personal grievances provided a motive. While a few teachers, friends, and relatives indicated that the shooter had been bullied as a child, none said that it had been severe, and a larger number said they had never seen him bullied or heard him complain of it. But this line of questioning is peculiar to begin with. Even if evidence of bullying had been found, it could not possibly amount to a motive in any ordinary sense for a young man to murder people who had never victimized him—particularly not twenty children who had yet to be born when he himself was a child. (MORE: Sandy Hook Shootings: Why Did Adam Lanza Target a School?) When we search for a “motive,” we’re looking for things like self-defense, revenge, jealousy, or personal dispute. There are also motives in which the victim may be somewhat more arbitrary, such as robbery, sexual assault, or sadistic pleasure. But there is no evidence that any of these motives apply to the Newtown shooting, as there almost never is for mass shootings—which is why we speak of them as “senseless.” The reason that we never find these motives is that the slaughter of random victims is what mass shootings are ultimately about. Indiscriminate targeting is the main criterion that criminologists use to distinguish rampage shootings from other forms of mass murder, like gang violence. The best framework for understanding rampage shootings at Newtown, Aurora, Columbine, Virginia Tech, and many others is not bullying, mental illness, or gun violence, but terrorism, only without (usually) a political agenda. In terrorism, the true target is society itself; the people who are killed are, grotesquely, a means to this end. Likewise for mass shootings, as forensic psychiatrist Paul E. Mullen wrote in a 2004 article, “Vengeance usually directed against society at large is part of the motivation.” MORE: Terrorists and Mass Shooters More Similar Than We Thought The particular reasons that drive each shooter are idiosyncratic. The common element is that mass shooters suffer from some toxic, paradoxical mix of narcissism and weak ego that brings them to make a deliberate choice to blame their frustrations on the world as a whole rather than on themselves. The mass shooting provides a means for the perpetrator to fulfill his unrequited grandiosity and hatred. The motive is not fame but infamy. Mullen writes, “they are eased towards their self-destruction by fantasies of how others will react and by the effects they believe their deaths will produce.” Like political terrorism, the mass shooting is a crafted public spectacle, a theater of violence in which we are the unwitting yet compliant audience. The report describes the shooter’s obsessive interest in prior massacres. But among its many inconclusions is that it finds “no clear indication why Sandy Hook Elementary School was selected.” Perhaps the answer is too sickening to be sayable: the shooter deliberately chose a target that would maximize the horror and ensure his place in the pantheon of anti-heroes. Trying to make ordinary sense out of these extraordinary crimes is fruitless. It leads reporters to broadcast the shooters’ manifestos and scribblings, to search for any scraps of frustration or injustice they suffered that might somehow explain their actions. But this devoted attention is just what allows the shooters to control not only their actions but the meaning of them. Putting a stop to mass shootings begins by agreeing that, once a person has resorted to the mass slaughter of indiscriminate victims, speculating on his motives means spreading half-truths that might encourage others to follow in his footsteps.

84,http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/gun-control-efforts-101153.html,"People gather at the National Cathedral on Thursday to remember gun violence victims. By REID J. EPSTEIN 12/13/2013 04:40 PM EST President Barack Obama responded to last December’s Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre by calling for the nation to end its indifference toward gun violence, but one year and one failed Senate vote later, Washington’s major players in the gun control push have beat a public retreat. The fight has moved from Capitol Hill to Main Street. Out is an immediate public push for legislation in Congress, with all the accompanying flashy public events. In is a series of local events across the country and painstakingly building a political infrastructure able to compete with the National Rifle Association. ( PHOTOS: Newtown school shooting remembered) Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, which organized a successful campaign this summer to pressure Starbucks into banning guns from its cafes, is preparing a similar effort aimed at McDonald’s, founder Shannon Watts told POLITICO. It’s part of the larger political shift from gun control advocacy groups , and a recognition that, like much of Obama’s second-term agenda, gun control is buried under the reality of a divided Congress. Saturday’s anniversary wasn’t a big political moment in D.C. The Newtown families asked the White House and major gun control organizations not to make a big political production out of Saturday’s anniversary, preferring to maintain it as a solemn remembrance. ( PHOTOS: Politicians with guns) Obama, for instance, marked the massacre’s anniversary not with a visit to Connecticut or even Saturday’s National Cathedral memorial service but with a private moment of silence at the White House. “There’s no question that Congress failed to do the right thing,” White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. “And in the end, there’s a limit on what a president can do. Other actions require congressional movement.” News of the nation’s latest school shooting, which left a Colorado shooter dead and a classmate in critical condition on Friday, didn’t come as a great shock. The White House released a perfunctory statement saying Obama was briefed about the situation and that federal officials remain in touch with their local law enforcement counterparts. Gun control advocates say they’ve learned the political lessons from the Newtown shooting, where the Senate waited four months to vote on background check legislation. Not only did they lose momentum and give the NRA a chance to rally its supporters, but the 20 years of inaction on gun control meant lawmakers were not well-versed on the issue. “The infrastructure just wasn’t there to turn it around quickly — the knowledge wasn’t there among Hill staff, among members of Congress who hadn’t voted on it for a decade,” said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, the director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a centrist think tank. “Now all of us know a heck of a lot more about this. We won’t need to take so much time to figure that out. If there is a tragedy that specifically involves one of the policies we’re talking about, were going to see more swift action.” ( Also on POLITICO: Colorado high school shooting) Last year when Obama returned to Washington after speaking at the Newtown memorial service , Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, was the first gun control activist to get a White House meeting. That was in part because he was the only game in town. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords’s Americans for Responsible Solutions, the Sandy Hook Promise and Moms Demand Action have all formed this year. The post-Obama campaign nonprofit Organizing for Action launched in January with gun violence prevention as one of its four main policy areas. OFA solicited its members recently to host Newtown anniversary vigils but said it was not using the date to make a policy push; volunteers were simply “coming together in their communities in remembrance of the tragic events in Newtown a year ago,” a spokesman said. The low-key events were meant to keep activists engaged and lawmakers from forgetting the issue. They are also planning for the midterm elections while doing the macabre job of preparing a response for what they see as the inevitability of the next mass shooting while at the same time making the fight as much cultural as political. ( Flashback: Obama visits Sandy Hook memorial service) “I hope there’s not a next time, but if there is, we’ve laid the groundwork; we’ve got momentum across the country,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Democrats’ gun violence task force. On the forefront of this effort is Shannon Watts, a spunky Indiana woman and political neophyte who started Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America as a Facebook group after the Newtown massacre. Now Watts, a mother and stepmother of five, is the head of an organization vying to become the MADD of gun control. Watts hopes to make background checks a women’s issue the same way abortion rights are — something candidates, particularly Democrats, are forced to forcefully support. The McDonald’s campaign, coming off the successful Starbucks effort, won’t be the last. “There are more white whales out there,” she said in an interview at a Capitol Hill Starbucks. McDonald’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Watts spoke shortly after a brief meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who urged the Moms activists to press moderate Republicans to demand a House vote. Democrats, she said, are all already on board. “There needs to be more calling out of people, in the districts of people who seem to be sympathetic, especially Republicans, because for Democrats, it’s a settled thing,” she said at the seven-minute meeting and photo-op in the Capitol. Watts wasn’t buying any hope of a gun control bill in 2014. “I continue to believe that this is not the Congress to get much done,” she said afterward. Forty-six senators and 242 House members have scored “A” ratings from the NRA, and when Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sought to use his “A”rating to carry an expanded background checks bill, it was met with heavy opposition and fell five votes short of the 60 needed to move in the Senate. Manchin, who led the background checks measure with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), wasn’t doing interviews related to the anniversary or attending any memorial events. One area of potential common ground is more funding for mental health issues and restrictions. Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday revealed $100 million in mental health funding from the departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. But mental health-only legislation won’t draw support from gun control advocates for fear it will allow background checks opponents to color themselves as doing something on guns. “It’s just subterfuge, let’s talk about this so we don’t have to talk about that,” Pelosi said. “It doesn’t mean that we don’t want to do some good things about mental health. We have to be discerning about what it is we’re doing.” NRA officials declined repeated requests to comment, but its lobbying arm recently accused the White House and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg of trying to make political hay out of the Newtown anniversary. “Obama and Bloomberg are pulling out the stops, knowing that support for gun control — which rose in the days after Sandy Hook — is waning,” read a post on the the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action website. “Not only was the Obama gun control agenda defeated in the Senate last spring, a new CNN poll shows that support for gun control has dropped by six points since January, and a majority of Americans now oppose stricter gun laws.” As far as momentum in Washington goes, the NRA is correct. Vice President Joe Biden and his top aides long ago ceased participating in regular gun control strategy sessions with gun control activists. Attorney General Eric Holder, who appeared by Biden’s side at a series of gun control meetings, has moved on. Holder met with law enforcement officials recently for an hour, and gun issues — including the reauthorization of the Undetectable Firearms Act — were mentioned only briefly at the meeting’s tail end, according to meeting participants. “Gun safety remains a high priority for the attorney general, and we continue to take common sense measures to reduce gun violence,” a Holder aide said. If gun control groups can change the makeup of Congress, it’s going to be a heavy lift. Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns group ran TV ads in Arkansas in blasting Sen. Mark Pryor after the Democrat voted against the background checks bill. But asked if the group would hit Pryor again in next year’s campaign against House Republican Tom Cotton, who would be the same or worse for the cause, the group’s executive director, Mark Glaze, demurred. “There’s plenty of time between now and the midterm, and I think a lot will depend on where legislation is and where they are on the issue as the election approaches,” he said. “The mayor will make that decision.” The group recently hired Bruce Cohen, a longtime aide to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). But gun control advocates need bipartisan support, said Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way. “Continuing to push it or to use it as a hammer on folks who voted the wrong way is to make it more of a partisan issue, when what we need to do is to broaden the gun safety side,” she said.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. TAMPA, Fla. – The Florida family of a woman slain during the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard is the first to file a lawsuit against the government and defense contractors, alleging that officials ignored red flags about the killer's deteriorating mental health. The suit on behalf of the family of Mary DeLorenzo Knight was filed Wednesday morning in federal court in Tampa. The lawsuit named the Navy, the Department of Veterans Affairs and two defense contractors as defendants. It's seeking at least $37.5 million in damages. ""We're all just torn apart,"" said Patricia DeLorenzo, the sister of the victim. ""We just want to get through this."" Mary DeLorenzo Knight was one of 12 people killed by Aaron Alexis on Sept. 16 before he was killed in a shootout with police. The lawsuit said the contractor that Alexis worked for should have told the Navy about his prior, and documented, mental health problems and that the Navy should not have given him security clearance. Navy officials have said they found no record that the company alerted the Navy about his mental health. The lawsuit said the VA failed to treat his mental illness when Alexis went to a VA emergency room Aug. 23 for insomnia and detailed three arrests involving Alexis and his post-traumatic stress disorder, anger management problems and alcohol abuse. A VA spokesman said Wednesday it does no comment on pending litigation. A Navy spokeswoman said the Navy remains committed to providing continued support to the victims and families through its Washington Navy Yard Recovery Task Force but referred The Associated Press to the U.S. Department of Justice for comment about ongoing litigation. An email sent to the Department of Justice seeking comment wasn't immediately answered. The company that employed the Washington Navy Yard shooter, Fort Lauderdale-based The Experts, pulled his access to classified material for two days in August when mental health problems became evident, but restored it quickly and never told Navy officials about the withdrawal. An initial Navy review revealed that The Experts ordered Alexis, a computer contractor, back to Washington, D.C., after a police incident in Rhode Island in August, according to senior U.S. officials. The company then withdrew his ability to access secret-level data for two days, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation. It did not disclose why his access was reinstated. Less than six weeks later, the former Navy reservist gunned down 12 civilian workers in a Navy Yard building, and police fatally shot him. The Experts did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Sidney Matthew, the Tallahassee, Fla.-based attorney for the DeLorenzo family, said that while officials ignored problems about Alexis' mental health, the Navy could have stopped the shooting by requiring everyone to walk through a metal detector prior to entering the Navy Yard. He said he hopes that this lawsuit will spur the Navy and other branches of the military to install such detectors. ""Mary DeLorenzo Knight's life needs to stand for something,"" he said. ""We want change.""

News By Associated Press Submit December 10, 2013 | 12:54pm A Fox News reporter is protected by New York law from being forced to reveal her sources for a story about the suspect in the mass shooting that left 12 people dead in a suburban Denver movie theater last year, the state’s top court ruled Tuesday. The state’s shield law supports refusing to recognize a Colorado court’s petition for a subpoena, the New York Court of Appeals ruled, 4 to 3. Lawyers for the suspect, James Holmes, wanted New York-based reporter Jana Winter brought to Colorado to name two law officers who told her Holmes had mailed a notebook depicting violence to a psychiatrist. They argued that the sources violated a judge’s gag order, may have lied under oath about that and won’t be credible as trial witnesses. “There is a substantial likelihood that a New York reporter will be compelled to divulge the identity of a confidential source (or face a contempt sanction) if required to appear in the other jurisdiction — a result that would offend the core protections of the shield law, a New York public policy of the highest order,” the court said in overturning a mid-level appeals court’s decision supporting the subpoena. One dissenting judge said New York’s law does not protect Winters because the privileged communications with her sources took place in another state. Winter’s attorney welcomed the ruling. “We are absolutely thrilled and delighted that New York state’s highest court has once again reaffirmed how important the protection of confidential sources is to the proper functioning of our society,” said the attorney, Dori Hanswirth. Hanswirth said she did not know whether Holmes’ attorneys would appeal to federal court but said a federal judge would have no jurisdiction. “This case is over as far as Jana Winter,” Hanswirth said. “She does not have to appear in Colorado again and she will not appear.” The ruling was a defeat for Holmes’ lawyers, who said Winter’s sources had violated the gag order. The defense wanted Winter to identify the sources so Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. in Colorado could somehow punish them. “Today’s ruling is a major win for all journalists. The protection of Jana Winter’s confidential sources was necessary for the survival of journalism and democracy as a whole. We are very grateful that the highest court in New York State agreed with our position,” said Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes. Daniel King, one of Holmes’ attorneys, did not initially return a call seeking comment. Defense lawyers and prosecutors routinely decline to comment, citing the gag order. The impact of Winter’s victory on the overall case against Holmes will likely be minimal, however. Holmes is accused of opening fire on a packed audience in a movie theater in the Denver suburb of Aurora during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” in July 2012. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. Defense lawyers have acknowledged Holmes was the shooter, and the central question is whether he was legally insane at the time. Winter had said she would refuse to comply if the judge ordered her to identify her sources, even though she could have been sentenced to jail indefinitely for contempt of court. Winter’s story, posted on the Fox News website days after the shootings, cited unnamed law-enforcement officials as saying Holmes sent a notebook to his psychiatrist containing scribblings of stick figures being shot and a written description of an upcoming attack. Authorities have confirmed that Holmes did send the notebook, but they have never publicly said what it contains. He underwent a mandatory sanity evaluation last summer. The results have not been made public. Holmes’ trial has been postponed indefinitely while attorneys argue a prosecution motion seeking further psychiatric evaluation.

Scott Walker on Friday pushed back against calls for tougher gun control laws, saying ""we don't know the particulars"" of the violence in which nine people as well as the shooter died. ""It's less than 24 hours, and we don't really know the details. Other than we know that our prayers go out to the victims and their families,"" Walker said Friday. President Barack Obama said on Thursday night that thoughts and prayers are not enough. Visibly frustrated, the president challenged voters wanting to deal with the problem to vote for elected officials who agree with that priority. Obama said the nation's response to mass shootings has become routine — from the reporting by the media, to his own comments, to the opposition to gun control laws aimed at deterring the violence. ""We've become numb to this,"" Obama said. But Walker shifted the focus on Friday from gun control to mental health, saying that such incidents in Wisconsin have frequently been linked to mental health problems. ""Historically, the one constant thread has been people suffering from some degree of mental illness,"" Walker said. ""In many of these cases, someone has fallen through the cracks without getting the appropriate treatment for mental health issues."" During an appearance at GenMet in Mequon, a custom metal manufacturer, the governor addressed a broad range of issues, including his sinking job approval level, the presidential race and recent comments from a judge who accused Walker of wanting to let a woman die rather than letting her have an abortion. ""Governor Walker, before he withdrew from the presidential race, said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies,"" federal appeals Judge Richard Posner said Thursday during arguments in Chicago on Wisconsin's abortion admitting privileges law. ""Is that kind of official Wisconsin policy?"" ""He's just fundamentally wrong. He's just 100% wrong. Couldn't be more wrong on that. That is not at all my position,"" Walker said. ""He should stick to looking at the law and not pontificating on politics."" When asked about his job approval numbers, Walker repeated his comments that being present in the state will be the best way to improve them. And, when asked about real estate mogul Donald Trump soaring to the leader in Wisconsin, Walker said it's still early in the race.

        Claudia Koerner Reporting From Colorado Springs Reporting From Colorado Springs Posted on November 28, 2015, at 9:09 p.m. ET Vicki Cowart, center, executive director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, joins community members Saturday at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Colorado Springs. COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado — As investigators began the long process of seeking answers in the hours-long shooting and standoff that left three people dead, Planned Parenthood officials on Saturday said they believed the tragedy was motivated by opposition to abortion. Friday started as a normal day at the health center in Colorado Springs — but a normal day at Planned Parenthood also includes a fair amount of attention to security, regional president and CEO Vicki Cowart told BuzzFeed News.  Beyond the near-daily protests at the public sidewalk adjacent to the medical complex, no city or Planned Parenthood official was aware of any previous threat of violence directed at the Colorado Springs clinic. Cowart on Saturday said based on witness accounts, the organization now believes the shooting was ""motivated by opposition to safe and legal abortion.""  It was close to noon when a staff member in the lobby heard the first gunshot, which Planned Parenthood officials believe took place outside the clinic. The staff's active shooter training kicked in, Cowart said. The health center manager dialed 911, and everyone else silenced their cell phones. The young woman in the lobby ushered waiting patients to the back of the building's exam rooms and offices.  ""That probably saved many lives,"" Cowart said. Mayor John Suthers was in communication with Colorado Springs Police Chief Peter Carey early in the five-hour standoff and joined the numerous members of law enforcement agencies at the command post.  Among the police and sheriff's deputies who came to the scene were security staff from Planned Parenthood, who gave officers access to interior security cameras and images of the building's layout.  The diagrams were emailed to officers inside the clinic, Suthers said, offering crucial intel. Through the security cameras, officers in the command post watched the movements of the suspect, later identified as Robert L. Dear. Command post staff passed on the suspect's locations to the officers inside, allowing them to extract the nine patients and 15 Planned Parenthood staff members hiding in other parts of the building.  ""It was pretty amazing to watch,"" Suthers said. Suthers was also there for the chilling radio call that an officer was down. Other officers remained calm in spite of the tense situation, he said. He described the suspect's movements as calm and deliberate. Colorado Springs shooting suspect Robert Lewis Dear of North Carolina is seen in undated photos provided by the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. At first, the alleged gunman sat in a chair, wearing a trench coat and holding what appeared to be an assault weapon, Suthers said. He then moved to a hallway where he had a better vantage point of officers' arrival.  As part of the SWAT response, police drove a bearcat — an armored vehicle — into the lobby of the clinic. They were preparing for a final assault, driving into the area where the suspect was cornered, when he called out to officers, Suthers said.  ""Just as those final preparations were taking place, he yelled to people that he was willing to give up,"" Suther said. ""So we watched on the security cameras as he gave himself up."" One police officer and two civilians were killed in the shooting. Nine others were taken to hospitals with injuries, five of whom are police officers.  A day after the tragedy, some normalcy slowly began to return to Colorado Springs. The King Sooper grocery store where many of the 300 bystanders hid allowed them to return for left-behind belongings Saturday morning. By midday, its doors reopened to shoppers.  But the medical plaza where the Planned Parenthood clinic has been for about six years remained cordoned off, the lights of squad cars flashing bright against the new snow, as crime scene investigators went to work. The investigation — being assisted by federal law enforcement — is only at its beginning, Carey told reporters Saturday afternoon.  ""It was a tough night, and there is much to be done today and in the coming weeks,"" Carey said. The quick response of officers from multiple agencies, including the University of Colorado Colorado Springs police, helped save lives, Carey added. The mayor met Saturday morning with the four injured officers who remained at Penrose Hospital. They were surrounded by colleagues and relatives, and Suthers said they were in good spirits.  ""A couple of them are very lucky in terms of where bullets hit,"" he said.  Suthers added they were all looking forward to healing and getting back to their jobs.  ""They felt it was a privilege to be doing their jobs and want to get back at it,"" he said.  Officer Garrett Swasey was among the three people killed in the shooting. The names of two others, identified only as civilians, have not been released pending autopsies scheduled for Monday and notification of family. Hostages are escorted to safety during an active shooter situation outside the Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs on Friday. The police chief said he could not yet say whether they had been shot inside or outside the clinic. Police are waiting on forensic evidence and statements from the officers who were victims of the shooting.  ""That's going to be at least a few more days,"" Carey said.  He added it's also too early to say why the alleged shooter was at the clinic. In response to a question about the suspect and his motives, Carey all he knew was the man's name and age. Unnamed sources told multiple media outlets Dear allegedly talked about ""no more baby parts"" and President Obama during police interviews. NBC News described the comments as ""rants"" that touched on politics and abortion. However, it was still unknown Saturday how the comments might have played into a motive, NBC News also reported. A court hearing for Dear is scheduled for Monday afternoon.  Though questions remain about the shooter, Rev. Nori Rost described his actions as one thing: domestic terrorism.  Rost and All Souls Unitarian Church in downtown Colorado Springs held a vigil Saturday to mourn the victims, show solidarity within the community, and to stand with Planned Parenthood.  About 150 people prayed for the families of everyone involved, including the shooter. They sang ""Amazing Grace"" and wrote letters of support for Planned Parenthood staff, the Swasey family, and loved ones of the two unnamed victims.  ""I don't know if I knew any of the victims,"" Rost said. ""But I don't need to know because we are all one."" Father Bill Carmody kneels in a pew during a vigil at Unitarian Universalist church on Saturday. Rev. Amanda Henderson of the Interfaith Alliance of Colorado added that no act of violence should happen, but the location of the standoff had significance.  ""We know that women's health and women's bodies have been under a constant threat of attack, and we are here to stand with Planned Parenthood,"" she said.  One woman stood up from the pews unexpectedly to say that while she supported Planned Parenthood, she disagreed with the tone of the vigil.  ""I thought we were here to grieve for the people who died, not make political statements,"" she said.  As the woman walked out, Rost said the day was for mourning, but it was also a day to talk about the continuing issue of gun violence.  ""If we do not in our time of grief realize that something must be done about this, then we are falling short of honoring the lives that were lost,"" she said.  At a later press conference, Gov. John Hickenlooper expressed his profound grief at learning of another mass shooting in Colorado.  ""There aren't words to describe the feeling when you hear something like this is happening,"" he said.  He said state officials would look at potential reforms in the wake of the shooting — but not on Saturday, as families were grieving and the police investigation remained in early stages.  ""Our entire country is trying to figure out how to address issues of violence in our communities,"" he said. ""I don't think this is the right time to have that conversation.""  As one point of action, however, he noted at the millions of dollars the state has poured into mental health services over the last four years, since the shooting massacre at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater.  ""We're going to reevaluate how that money is being spent,"" Hickenlooper said.  Planned Parenthood officials are also looking toward the future and the eventual reopening of the Colorado Springs clinic.  ""We'll be rebuilding it as soon as we can, but I don't know what that means yet,"" Cowart told BuzzFeed News.  Until then, the other Planned Parenthood facilities in the state remain open. The organization and its staff are joining the Colorado Springs community in grieving for the lives lost and in thanking the officers who responded, Cowart added.  For now, the clinic's staff members are home with their families, but Cowart expects they'll return.  ""Everyone is resolute,"" she said. ""Everyone does this work because they believe really deeply all people should have access to reproductive healthcare."" buzzfeed.com buzzfeed.com buzzfeed.com buzzfeed.com Claudia Koerner is an editor and reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

98,http://www.nationalmemo.com/states-see-little-progress-on-gun-reform-one-year-after-newtown-massacre/,"As the first anniversary of the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut approaches, a New York Times report highlighting the gun reform measures that have been introduced and passed throughout the country over the past year shows just how little states and lawmakers have done to strengthen gun restrictions. In 2013, “about 1,500” state gun bills were introduced, according to the Times—178 passed at least one chamber of a state legislature, but only 109 became law. Of the 109 gun bills passed by states, 39 tightened gun restrictions and 70 loosened them. Not surprisingly, most of the gun laws that passed did so in Republican-controlled states.  States controlled by Republicans passed nine pieces of legislation that tightened gun restrictions and an overwhelming 49 that eased restrictions. In contrast, Democratic-controlled states passed 25 laws that created stricter gun restrictions, and only three that loosened gun restrictions. In states with mixed control, five laws that strengthen gun restrictions passed and a greater 18 that loosen restrictions also passed. Americans seem less enthusiastic about passing stricter gun reform in the wake of the mass shooting that killed 20 children and six adults. A month after the shootings, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 56 percent of Americans favored stricter gun laws. Two months after the shootings, in February, another NBC/WSJ poll found an even greater 61 percent said they supported stricter gun laws. However, by April, as the Senate debated stricter gun reform that eventually failed to pass, support had begun to fade, with only 55 percent of Americans saying they wanted stricter gun laws. According to the most recent NBC/WSJ poll released Friday, just 52 percent of Americans now support stricter gun laws, while 38 percent say gun laws should remain the same and another 8 percent say laws should be less strict. With declining public support and legislative attempts to strengthen gun reform failing to gain traction, it appears that the nation is back to where it was before that tragic shooting occurred.

The bells rang 26 times Saturday at St. Rose of Lima church in Newtown to honor each of the victims. Gov.  Dannel P. Malloy asked for houses of worship around the state to ring  their bells at 9:30 a.m., the moment that Adam Lanza shot his way into  the school. Malloy also called for flags to be lowered to half-staff  around the state. In a radio address Saturday, President Barack  Obama called on the nation to help prevent future violence. He planned  to observe a moment of silence at the White House. Lanza killed 20 children and six educators before taking his own life. Earlier Saturday, President  Barack Obama called on the nation to help prevent future violence in an  address released on Saturday's anniversary of the school shooting in  Newtown, which planned a day of quiet reflection with private memorial  services and the ringing of bells for the victims. Obama said in  his radio address that the massacre of 20 children and six educators at  Sandy Hook Elementary School will be remembered as a tragedy that  inspired the nation to make communities safer. ""We have to do more  to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun so easily.  We have to do more to heal troubled minds. We have to do everything we  can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and  valued, and cared for,"" said Obama, who also planned to observe a moment  of silence at the White House in honor of the victims. Newtown  officials have called for privacy and asked town residents to honor the  victims through acts of service and kindness. At a joint appearance  during the week in Newtown, some of the victims' families urged people  to find ways to give back to their own communities. ""In this way,  we hope that some small measure of good may be returned to the world,""  JoAnn Bacon, whose 6-year-old daughter, Charlotte, was killed at Sandy  Hook. The town had no formal events planned for Saturday, and officials have discouraged the news media from coming to Newtown. ""We  are trying to respect the world's interest in us, but we also have a  real need in our community to gain a foothold,"" First Selectman Pat  Llodra said. The gunman, Adam Lanza, killed his mother inside  their Newtown home on Dec. 14, 2012, before driving to the school, where  he carried out his rampage. He killed himself as police arrived. At  St. Rose of Lima, the Roman Catholic church that hosted the funerals of  eight children, a service will include the dedication of a memorial  arch and the ringing of peace bells that also were rung at Virginia Tech  after the mass shooting there in 2007 and in New York after the Sept.  11, 2001, terrorist attacks. © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

I stared down a sea of Confederate flags to find out what that's like. By
      
        Kashana Cauley Posted on November 30, 2015, at 1:00 p.m. ET On the first Saturday morning in August, I stepped out of my car in a suburban Indiana parking lot and watched three middle-aged white men aim squinty-eyed suspicion at me from two spaces away. As a Wisconsin native, I’m used to squinty-eyed white Midwestern suspicion. But since we stood several hundred feet from a lot of guns and I figured the guys were probably armed, my feet froze. I had to drag myself to the entrance of the Kokomo Gun Show, where a brown-haired stocky white guy in his twenties talked to his friends while resting his elbow on a rifle butt as if leaning on a gun was the most natural posture imaginable. I passed hundreds of parked cars on my way to the front door. This was a couple months after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine people in a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and a week after John Russell Hauser was accused of killing two and wounding nine in a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana. Gun purchases in America tend to spike after mass shootings and terrorist attacks, because such events heat up the gun control debate. On this Black Friday — less than a month after the terrorist mass shooting in Paris — gun sales were projected to spike again. There were 50 gun shows listed across the country, and the FBI predicted that gun sellers would run a record 190,000 background checks in a 24-hour period — not that prospective buyers need to undergo a background check to buy guns from private vendors at the Kokomo Gun Show or those in dozens of other states including Florida, Texas, and Ohio. But background checks are required in Illinois, where my teenage cousin joined a gang and shot someone in 2010. He took his lawyer’s advice not to talk about his case, so I channeled my sadness into learning how Chicago gangs like his get their guns. More of the guns used in Chicago gang shootings come from Indiana than anywhere else. On paper, buying a gun in Indiana is extremely easy. Go to a gun show, decide on a gun from a seller’s private collection, hand over an Indiana ID and some cash, leave armed. But I didn’t think I, a black woman, would be welcome at a gun show. Four people sat at the registration table: one white guy in his fifties and three women in their twenties, one of whom was black. Her blackness threw me off nearly as much as the mood outside. We made the sort of eye contact that meant we’d acknowledged each other’s blackness but we weren’t going to bond over it. I paid the $5 admission fee and told the guy, who called me sweetie, that since I didn’t have a gun I didn’t need to check mine while I shop. I turned away from him toward tables filled with more guns than I’d ever seen, forgot how to breathe, and retreated to the bathroom to calm myself behind a locked stall. Americans like to use big tent metaphors to describe our political affiliations. We paint our values with broad strokes and then point to the many types of people on our side as evidence that we are open-minded, accepting, and correct. Pro-gun advocates are no exception: People in favor of lax gun laws say that since the majority of gun owners are law-abiding, reasonable people, we can overlook the bigots, the criminals, and the domestic terrorists like Robert Lewis Dear, who is accused of killing three people and injuring nine more at a Colorado Planned Parenthood on Black Friday. As long as the lone criminals are white. Last spring, Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher trespassing on federal land, faced off with federal agents while armed and suffered no consequences. Same goes for the Oath Keepers, the militia that showed up heavily armed to Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson over the summer, angering local law enforcement — though evidently not as much as unarmed, black Michael Brown. The previous year, John Crawford, III, 22, and Tamir Rice, 12, were shot and killed by police while carrying toy guns in Ohio, an open-carry state. And in the past few years, other unarmed blacks have been killed for offenses such as selling hand-rolled cigarettes and asking for help after a car accident. Black people aren’t part of the big tent of gun ownership. We’re never assumed to be law abiding, reasonable gun owners. That kind of gun ownership is seen as an upstanding white person act; a picket fence closed to outsiders like blacks. I wanted to see what was on the other side of the slats separating me from perfectly honorable, white people gun show attendance. The exhibition hall was 27,000 square feet, or about half a football field. The lighting was fluorescent, the folding tables cheap, the guns sold alongside ammunition, knives, extra-strength flashlights, beef and turkey jerky, and lots of camo. There were plenty of private vendors standing behind signs that said Private Collection, Cash Only, No Questions Asked. One vendor tried to sell me one of his lovely retro guns, .38 specials with pearly stocks and long, tapered silver barrels that would look just right in a woman’s hand in a '60s art film. But most of the guns in the room were standard black handguns and rifles. The room’s demographics: roughly 300 people total, overwhelmingly white guys in their forties to seventies. I saw three white female gun vendors, one South Asian male gun vendor, one black guy selling knives, one black woman selling guns, and one 10-year-old black kid scanning the tables with his white dad. This was a lot more diversity than I expected, but not enough to stop people from staring at me. The first person who seemed happy to see me was a biracial female gun vendor who asked me not to print her name. G is 45 years old, half black, half white, and works part-time at a gym. She didn’t often see black people at shows like this, and she was eager to talk about the racial demographics of gun shows. The atmosphere is “conservative,” she told me, and “can feel unwelcoming sometimes.” Growing up in Indianapolis, G didn’t see the need for guns. Then she moved to Kokomo, less than an hour outside the city, and met her white fiancée. He educated her ""on guns and why they’re useful,” and manned the table across the aisle from us. She owns guns, practices shooting them at a nearby range, and keeps them around for protection. “I don’t want to know what it’s like to use them,” she told me. “I’d rather not know. I need the information, but I don’t want to use it.” I took another lap around the show. The most charitable way to describe the mood was quiet. Gun shoppers are not a talkative group. White men looked at me with cut eyes and pinched mouths, but also at each other. I saw one guy wearing a T-shirt that said It’s Not Racist If It’s True, and looked back at G from halfway across the room. She seemed perfectly comfortable sitting behind her table, and I ached for her anyway, having to see T-shirts like that at shows like this. I met one friendly white guy, Scott. He said he sells a lot of guns to black women in Ohio and gushed to me about the AR-15. He picked one up, put the gun’s butt on his chin and told me that thanks to its lack of recoil he could fire it in that position if he wanted. I knew I was supposed to get excited about a gun I could fire from my face, so I added some oomph to my smile. He recommended a nearby brewery for lunch. Then I made eye contact with another round of flinty white men and re-entered the malaise that gripped the entire room. My black dad is a sincere supporter of the Second Amendment. He owns two rifles and two handguns. The rifles are for deer hunting, a typical Wisconsinite passion. The handguns are for home defense. I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, a roughly 250,000-person university town, where it was not uncommon for my high school classmates to miss an extra day or two around Thanksgiving to hunt deer. I enjoy venison, especially when cooked in butter. I do not own a gun, but I could. I’m equally familiar with the uniquely white Midwestern combination of down-home friendliness and suspicion that I encountered at the gun show, in alternating rounds. It’s subtle, but it’s constant, and I felt it for the 23 years I lived there. Sometimes it bubbled into something more, like the fourth grader who called me a nigger at school. But mostly it was the high school and college friends who told me I “wasn’t that black,” and confided in me about their love lives and career dreams. It’s the dizzying swing from Scott and his lunch recommendations to the men who stare at me as if blinking might physically wound them. It was a 25-year-old woman named Sarah’s job to collect the entry fee and make sure people didn’t steal the guns, which she told me they try to do “all the time.” Sarah didn’t own any guns herself, but she shot friends’ guns in their backyards. Earlier I asked Scott where he shot his guns and he said the same thing: in his backyard. I imagined entire Midwestern towns of people wandering out the back door on summer days to aim bullets into dirt. Later it occurred to me what was missing from this picture: the kind of hunting culture that indicates people plan to shoot something other than each other. There was no mention of deer, or skeet, or fun, or even a significant profit. Scott said he only brings in $40 or $50 a gun. All I found was a vague, room-wide fear that explains how G can be into guns and not want to have to use her guns. The gun show is where that white suspicion arms itself. Again, my dad’s a home invasion guy, so I kind of understand their fear. And yet I don’t. Ask white suspicion what it’s afraid of and it smiles frantically. It evades the question, and it doubles down on its right to be white, suspicious, and armed. One gun show table held pamphlets for the Oath Keepers, the non-partisan militia whose mission is to protect Americans from being disarmed — using assault rifles. But what it feels like people are most suspicious of is me. I turned a corner and found an overweight man in his sixties with a thin halo of hair and suspenders holding up his jeans behind a table full of bumper stickers. Confederate flags screamed redly among the black and white right-wing slogans. Here, in the Union state of Indiana, which outlawed slavery in 1820, gun owners embrace the national symbol for being willing to go to war for your right to abuse black people. “Never Give Up!” one said. “Deal With It!” said the other. Looking at those stickers was like being slapped in the face. I stood there paralyzed long enough to give the impression that I was seriously considering buying something. When I realized that I feared the guy sitting behind the table too much to whip out my phone and photograph the stickers on the spot, I bought one of each so I could take my pictures at home. I attempted to give off an “I am a badass for standing here and buying your Confederate flags even though you hate me” vibe. But I doubt it covered the nervousness that made my armpit sweat pour down like rain. The vendor didn’t care to make eye contact with me, even when I handed over my $3. He furtively put the cash in his pocket and found a wall to contemplate with great passion. I stared down hate and it wasn’t worth it. The transaction ended quickly and not soon enough. In defiance of Confederate flag number one, I gave up. I walked outside and took my first deep breath in hours. But the calm that settled over me upon leaving the gun show disappeared when I remembered the flags in my purse. I was disgusted at myself for giving $3 to a man who despised me, a feeling that made my hands shake on the wheel. For the entire 700-plus mile drive home I never took more than five minutes’ rest from cursing myself for donating money to the Confederate flag cause.

105,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/hc-sandyhook-911-calls-released-20131204-story.html,"With terror in her voice, Barbara Halstead begged with police dispatchers for help, ending her 24-second 911 call with the haunting plea of ""Sandy Hook School please"" as 11 gunshots rang out in the background. Those shots fired by Adam Lanza were in the hallway of the school on Dec. 14. Principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach were the first of 26 victims, including 20 first-graders, killed in the rampage. After months of debate, Newtown officials Wednesday released six 911 calls received by the police department as the shooting was unfolding. Halstead's was the first made that morning. Custodian Rick Thorne could be heard on at least three. He spent more than 10 minutes on the phone with dispatchers. The calls provide insight both into the terror faced by teachers and staff members and the poise with which they sought help in the face of immediate danger. The calls offer few new details on police response or Lanza's actions that morning. Thorne's first call ended just as Lanza killed himself. His last ended with him urgently identifying himself to Newtown officers who entered the building nearly six minutes after they had arrived. Another call came from a teacher who calmly described being holed up in her classroom with her students and how she needed to lock her door. In one call, an unidentified teacher who was shot in the foot tells the dispatcher that she is bleeding. She says there are children in the classroom with her, but the door is not locked and that she did not believe it was safe to lock it. The 911 calls were released after a Superior Court judge denied an attempt by Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky to keep them sealed. Town officials also sought to keep the calls from becoming public, saying they were concerned about how the release would affect victims' families. Lanza shot and killed his mother, Nancy, at their Newtown home before driving to the school, which he once attended. In a recently released report, Sedensky concluded that Lanza acted alone in planning and carrying out the massacre. But an 11-month investigation could not determine a motive in the second-deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Sedensky closed the investigation by announcing there would be no criminal charges filed in the case and releasing a report that portrayed Lanza as an isolated, socially inept 20-year-old with a fascination for mass killers that seems to have been developed as far back as the fifth grade. Sedensky also released a detailed timeline of the events on the morning of Dec. 14 that shows that Newtown police officers were outside the school for more than five minutes before entering. He concluded that police believed there might have been more than one shooter and ""acted accordingly."" A number of 911 calls made to state police Troop L in Litchfield, many from cellphones, were not released Wednesday. They are expected to be among investigative documents released soon by state police. Those include calls from another teacher who was shot, Natalie Hammond, and a parent locked in the room where Hochsprung had been holding a meeting at the time Lanza shot his way through a glass window at the front entrance. Halstead's call to Newtown police was made at 9:35:39. The office secretary told the dispatcher, ""I think there's somebody shooting in here in Sandy Hook School."" Dispatcher Robert Nute replied, ""Why do you think that?"" ""Somebody's got a gun I saw a glimpse of somebody running down the hallway, they're still around me there's still shooting. Sandy Hook School please,"" Halstead said. While Halstead's call was short, Thorne remained on the phone with dispatchers for several minutes, giving them a layout of the school. He called 911 at 9:36:13, telling the dispatcher he could hear gunshots. ""Everything is locked up as far as I know,"" Thorne said. When the dispatcher asked if he saw anything out the window, Thorne replied, ""No it's still going on I can't get over there.."" ""OK I don't want you to go over there. I want to know what's happening with the students along the front corridor,"" Nute said. ""I'm not in the front,"" Thorne replied. ""Do you see anything or hear anything more?'' Nute asked. ""I keep hearing shooting, I keep hearing popping,"" Thorne said. At one point Thorne tells the dispatcher ""now it is silent"" but the shooting starts again. There are about six shots fired and then silence. About 30 seconds later, there is one last shot. Authorities have said the last shot is believed to have been from a pistol Lanza used to kill himself. While Nute was on the phone with Thorne, a state police dispatcher relayed to Newtown a call from the teacher who was shot in the foot. She told the dispatcher that she was huddled in Room 1 with students and two adults. The teacher told Newtown dispatcher Jennifer Barosi that her foot was bleeding. ""Are you safe?"" Barosi asked. ""I think so. My classroom door is not locked,"" the teacher said. The dispatcher instructs the teacher to apply pressure to her wound. ""Are you OK for now?"" Barosi asked. ""For now. Hopefully,"" the teacher replied. Note: An early version of this story made reference to one of the 911 calls coming from teacher Kaitlin Roig's classroom. The call did not come from Roig's room.

106,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/14/america-mass-murder-australia-gun-control-saves-lives,"The mass murder in Newtown Connecticut a year ago caused shock and sorrow all around the world. In Australia it also revived memories of our own horror on a similar scale, when dozens of people innocently going about their day were gunned down by a disturbed young man. Our tragedy occurred in 1996 at the Port Arthur historic site in Tasmania, one of Australia's most popular tourist destinations. The dead numbered 35, with more than 20 others injured. The victims ranged in age from 3 to 72. They included children, teens, adults and seniors; tourists and local workers; several couples, a pair of brothers, a mother and her two little daughters, and members of a retirees' club on an outing.  This was not the first shooting massacre we had suffered, but it was the largest in living memory. The tragedy ignited an explosion of public outrage, soul-searching and demands for better regulation of guns. We changed our laws. As a result, gun deaths in Australia have dropped by two-thirds, and we have never had another mass shooting. Every country is unique, but Australia is more similar to the US than is, say, Japan or England. We have a frontier history and a strong gun culture. Each state and territory has its own gun laws, and in 1996 these varied widely between the jurisdictions. At that time Australia's firearm mortality rate per population was 2.6/100,000 – about one-quarter the US rate (pdf), according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the US Center for Disease Control. Today the rate is under 1/100,000 – less than one-tenth the US rate (pdf). Those figures refer to all gun deaths – homicide, suicide and unintentional. If we focus on gun homicide rates, the US outstrips Australia 30-fold. The 1996 reforms made gun laws stronger and uniform across Australia. Semi-automatic rifles were prohibited (with narrow exceptions), and the world's biggest buyback saw nearly 700,000 guns removed from circulation and destroyed. The licensing and registration systems of all states and territories were harmonised and linked, so that a person barred from owning guns in one state can no longer acquire them in another. All gun sales are subject to screening (universal background checks), which means you cannot buy a gun over the internet or at a garage sale. Gun ownership requires a license, and every sale is subject to a 28-day waiting period. The licensing process considers not only the applicant's age and criminal convictions, but also a range of other factors relevant to possession of a product that is (a) designed for killing and (b) highly coveted by people who should not have it. Relevant factors include the applicant's living circumstances, mental and physical health, restraining orders or other encounters with the law, type of gun desired and for what purpose, safety training, storage arrangements, and the public interest. Police make whatever inquiries they think necessary to inform the decision on whether (or under what conditions) the license should be granted. This can include checking with neighbourhood police, the family doctor and especially spouses or partners. There are many red flags that do not appear in an automated computer record of criminal convictions: substance abuse, mental instability, conflict at home or at work, to name a few. Another risk factor is whether granting the license might make guns accessible to another household member whose own circumstances would disqualify them from a license – for example, a depressed teenager or a person with criminal convictions. The screening process serves to block dangerous or irresponsible candidates, but also underscores for applicants and their families that bringing home a gun is a serious decision which affects the entire household, and indeed the entire community. Many applicants abandon their request during the waiting period – dissuaded by family members, or simply because the momentary enthusiasm for gun ownership passes. Australia also requires a justifiable reason for the type of weapon the applicant wants to own. If you say you plan to hunt rabbits, your license doesn't allow you to a high-powered rifle. And if you already have a couple of guns suitable for hunting rabbits, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify acquiring more. This is a measure against the accumulation of private arsenals. A significant legal and cultural difference between our two countries: Australia doesn't accept anticipation of killing another person (self-defence) as a reason for owning a gun. To qualify for a handgun license, you must belong to and regularly attend a target shooting club. An important feature of a licence is that it must be renewed every few years, and it can be cancelled or suspended if the bearer no longer meets the standard required – for example, due to domestic violence or a dangerous mental condition. Australia didn't ban guns. Hunting and shooting are still thriving. But by adopting laws that give priority to public safety, we have saved thousands of lives.",2013-12-14 12:00:00,When will the US learn from Australia?

107,http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/12/health/mentally-ill-son/,"He is 14 and hears voices. He's been hospitalized more than 20 times. Stephanie Escamilla is tired of seeing the country focus on the mentally ill only when there's a national tragedy. So she and her son are telling their story â of a family on the brink. By Wayne Drash, CNNVideo and photography by Evelio Contreras, CNN Editorâs note: This story was first published in December 2013. The epilogue has  been updated. San Antonio, Texas (CNN) The boy wears SpongeBob pajamas and sits up in bed, a blanket draped over his shoulders. In his right hand he holds a rosary. ""Please, please, please help me,"" he whimpers. Imaginary voices bark at him. ""Go away,"" he tells them. ""Go away! Go away!"" He screams for his mother: ""They're making me have these bad thoughts."" Stephanie Escamilla is videotaping her son Daniel. He is 10. Nobody believes her when she says he hears voices. This tape will be her proof. When the voices come, they tell Daniel to kill his brother, his mother and himself. Sometimes he turns the TV on full blast to drown out their commands. Or sprinkles holy water around his bed. As the camera rolls, Stephanie calls psychiatric hospitals near her home in San Antonio. Repeatedly she is turned down. Nothing can be done for her son, she is told, unless ""he is a danger to himself or others."" It is December 2009, and Daniel's hallucinations last more than two hours. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta describes his experience with Stephanie Escamilla and her son, who is mentally ill. See more from CNN Parents Daniel is 14 now, and his mother no longer needs to convince doctors that he is mentally ill. He suffers from bipolar disorder with psychosis. In the past four years, he has been hospitalized more than 20 times. But a diagnosis merely marks a beginning. Raising a child with mental illness is ""a roller-coaster ride through hell,"" Stephanie says. She is engaged in an epic battle on multiple fronts. What if Daniel has an outburst in public and is misunderstood?  What if he succumbs to the voices? How can she help Daniel find joy? And what about the rest of her family? They need her, too. With broad shoulders and a thick frame, Stephanie looks the part of a worthy combatant and strong advocate. It wasn't always this way. She was a single mother with self-doubt, quick to blame herself for Daniel's plight. Imagine what it's like for a mother to watch her son suffer â the little boy who sang and danced to Michael Jackson tunes, who tossed the baseball out back, who she dreamed would become a doctor. Think how painful it is to hear him say nearly every day that he wants to kill himself. Stephanie's fight is literally one of life and death â a desperate attempt to win back her son from the mental illness trying to consume him. She'll do whatever it takes to save Daniel. The Navy Yard. Newtown. Aurora. Tucson. Virginia Tech. The only time mental illness dominates the national conversation is when something goes tragically wrong. But the dialogue doesn't last. It gets buried under arguments about gun control, video game violence and unheeded signs of trouble -- until there's yet another mass shooting. When Daniel feels he might have an episode of psychosis, he goes outside to ease his anxiety and to make sure he is not around his siblings. ""What we always say is we had the tragedies in Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia,"" says Mike Fitzpatrick, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, ""but there are smaller tragedies that happen every day in this country because people are untreated for mental illness. And they end up in jails, in homeless shelters â and families are torn apart."" Those small, quiet tragedies don't usually make headlines. The 75 million American families touched by mental illness, like Stephanie Escamilla's, largely deal with it in private.  Every day. It frays bonds, breaks up marriages. It steals hope. People don't ask how to help boys like Daniel. It takes a James Holmes to grab the nation's attention. A Jared Loughner. An Adam Lanza. Something has to be done about America's mentally ill. That refrain emerged stronger than ever last December after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Never mind that no one knew whether it was mental illness that drove Lanza. He killed 26 people, including 20 children. Wasn't that the definition of madness? I covered the tragedy in Newtown the week after the massacre and returned there a few times in the months that followed. A shuttered mental hospital overlooks the idyllic New England town; just down the hill sits a high-security prison housing the criminally insane. Standing there, I wondered about the state of our mental health system. I later learned the scope of the problem: More than 60 million adults and about 15 million children in America suffer some form of mental disorder. That's one in every four adults, one in five children. Far fewer live with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, but the numbers are still large: 13.6 million adults and about 2 million children. The mass shootings that shine a spotlight on mental illness actually stigmatize those who suffer with it. The vast majority, advocates point out, are far more likely to be the victims of violence â they often get beat up or bullied -- than to commit a violent act. What if the issue could be seen through the prism of an average American family â not just through the lens of a national tragedy? What could be learned from people who deal with the day-to-day reality of mental illness? I asked the largest nonprofit mental health advocacy group, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, to spread the word of my interest in telling that story. I recognized the hurdles. A family would open itself to scrutiny and, possibly, judgment â on top of everything else it faces. ""It is a risk factor for a marriage, for a family, to have a seriously ill child,"" says Ken Duckworth, medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.  Even for families who have resources and do everything right, it can take years to find the proper care, he says. But people who get that help can stabilize â and function in the world. Duckworth cautions against drawing conclusions about the paths of children or teens with mental illness. ""One person who loves you,"" he says, ""can make all the difference."" Stephanie Escamilla believes that. She also believes complete strangers could make a difference if only they understood. That motivates her to try to teach people about what it's like to walk in her son's shoes. A board member of the San Antonio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, she welcomed CNN into her home beginning in June. In the months that followed, I witnessed her resolve to change the path of a 14-year-old boy oscillating between the trials of adolescence and the anguish of mental illness. It's not just her fight, or Daniel's. It touches the entire family. Stephanie, 37, and her fiancÃ©, Jose Farias, 33, are raising three other children, ranging in age from 7 to 10, in their merged household. Also living with the family is Stephanie's mother, who has brain cancer. Stephanie and Jose asked that CNN refer to their oldest son as Daniel; that is not his real name, and his last name is different from theirs.  They also asked that CNN photograph him in a way that keeps his face hidden. Many in his hometown know Daniel has a mental illness, but the family didn't want that label to extend to the Internet, where it could dog him when he seeks a job or applies to college. If his illness has taught them anything, it's that people judge. But Stephanie and Jose â and, indeed, Daniel â are willing to take that risk. By telling their story, they hope to help others raising a mentally ill child and shed light on mental illness for those who remain clueless. Stephanie included Daniel in the decision to lay their lives bare. ""I'm going through a lot of stress and a lot of things that no kid should see, no kid should hear â and things you shouldn't do,"" he told me. ""I just don't want anybody else to go through that."" If it's true that one person who loves you can change your outlook, that force in Daniel's life is his mother. Stephanie hasn't sold out her son's dreams. She believes he can accomplish whatever he sets out to do. Yet she worries for his future: Will people accept him? Will he adapt to the world around him? Will he someday live under a bridge? The lights go dim. Stephanie stands at the podium and shows a photograph of Daniel looking dapper with deep brown eyes, trimmed brown hair and a broad smile. It's a recent picture. The next one shows him at 6 months, dressed in a Dallas Cowboys bib and winter cap. ""You would never know that he was going to have a mental illness,"" she tells the crowd. ""I mean, does he look like he has one there?"" Seventeen cadets being trained to work in the Bexar County jail system sit in the audience and shake their heads. Several blurt out: ""No."" ""He was a baby,"" she says. ""He was awesome. He was always happy."" On the day Daniel was born -- January 29, 1999 -- Stephanie eyed his tiny frame, all 5 pounds and 15 ounces, and marveled at how delicate he was. She felt a bond that touched her soul. She dreamed he would become a doctor, or join the military to explore the world. She was 23 and single. Raising a child alone, she knew, would not be easy. She promised her son one thing: I will always take care of you, no matter how hard it gets. The PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide. This one, titled ""Many Hospitalizations Thereafter,"" is jarring. It shows the dates of Daniel's hospitalizations:
						
						-- 03/25/09
						-- 12/11/09
						-- 03/26/10
						-- 04/29/10 ... On and on, the list goes: 17 in all. She tells the cadets the slide isn't up to date â the hospitalizations now number about 20. ""It is a roller-coaster ride,"" Stephanie says. ""I don't know if any of you guys have anybody in the family that have mental illness or have dealt with anybody with mental illness, but it is a ride that no one wants to take."" Stephanie moved from the rural town of Uvalde, Texas, to San Antonio to gain better access to mental health treatment. She took an overnight job at a hospital so she could be around during the day for her son. She works in a tuberculosis ward and once was a 911 dispatcher. Those experiences gave her another view of the mentally ill â from medical and law enforcement perspectives. She realized she could help her son by educating others. Two years ago, she did her first session for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office, which puts its personnel through mandatory crisis intervention training aimed at teaching the best ways to deal with the mentally ill. The goal is to ""de-escalate a situation and get people the help they need before going hands on and taking them to jail,"" says Cpl. Shannon Lunski, who helps lead the program. For these cadets, Stephanie puts a face on the struggle. She tells them about her long and frustrating journey: Daniel was diagnosed with ADHD at age 6, his first manic meltdown came at 10,  hospitals kept refusing to admit him ""because he had not hurt himself and he had not hurt anybody, and he didn't have a plan"" to act â the legal threshold required for hospital admittance. She plays a video of Daniel enduring an episode of psychosis from May 1 of this year. His legs and arms shake while he sits on a picnic table in the backyard. He places his head between his knees. Then, he stands and paces. He swats the air. His head darts back and forth, as if trying to shake the demons he sees and hears. ""This doesn't happen all the time,"" she says. ""It happens when he has something really stressful going on at school or he has a cycle. Sometimes, the cycle comes every two months; sometimes they're more frequent. I'm happy when they're gone for five months, but that hasn't happened for a while."" Stephanie's voice trembles. Some of the cadets cry. ""You guys are my psychotherapists,"" she tells them. ""Not a lot of people want to sit and hear you talk about mental illness."" She admits there were days when she wished she could just give her son away. She's ashamed of that thought now, but realizes she's only human. She turned her sorrow into action when she finally accepted Daniel's illness. It took time, and came only after she realized his condition was getting worse. She had an epiphany. ""I thought I hated my son,"" she says. ""But then I realized it wasn't him that I hated. It was his bipolar disorder."" Stephanie Escamilla became an advocate for those with mental illness after her son's condition worsened. She implores the cadets to show compassion when they arrive at a scene involving a disruptive child. ""You're going to be walking up, and what's going to be your first reaction?"" she asks. ""It's a kid acting bad,"" one cadet says. ""You're going to be judgmental, right? Is that actually how you should approach that?"" The cadet shakes his head. Think of families like hers, she tells them. ""Put yourselves in their shoes. You have officers come into your house, would you want them to judge you? ""I tell you this because you're going to come across homeless people like that, who are schizophrenic, who have not been on meds and are hearing voices,"" she says. ""Calm them down, talk to them. Tell them: 'It's just a voice. The voice isn't going to hurt you.'"" That's what she hopes someone would do for her son. The boy just needs a good spanking. Daniel needs a proper male role model. You're a bad mother. Stephanie has heard it all. Her mother, three sisters and brother abandoned her when Daniel was first diagnosed. They didn't believe Stephanie. There had to be another reason for his behavior. Friends told her, please, don't talk about mental illness around the children. But word leaked out. Kids taunted Daniel. Hey, stupid! You're mental! Once, Daniel was beaten by an acquaintance while a friend shot video that was later posted on YouTube. It showed Daniel getting punched in the face, then falling to the ground and being kicked. Some friends shunned Daniel and his mom. The phrase ""mental illness"" was met with fear, disbelief, prejudice, ignorance. Stephanie herself had not understood the early signs. At age 6, Daniel complained he heard voices. She downplayed it. She told herself the walls were paper thin, that he was hearing conversations throughout the home. Then, everything changed. On a fishing trip one weekend in March 2009, Stephanie watched as Daniel pushed their lunch supplies, one by one, off the top of a picnic table. Chips, cups, napkins. When she scolded him, he apologized: I'm sorry. I'm just clumsy. He kept the real reason to himself: Voices urged him to shove his 3-year-old brother into the lake so he would drown. Daniel pushed stuff off the table instead; it was his way of deflecting the voices, of keeping his brother safe. At school the following Monday, Daniel's hallucinations intensified. He stabbed himself in the head with a pencil because he was having more thoughts about hurting his brother. Finally, he confided in his teacher. Only then did his mother learn the truth. Mom, I have been having thoughts of wanting to hurt my brother, he told her, but don't worry, I don't want to harm him. Stephanie shifted into overdrive. She stayed home to monitor Daniel's behavior. She began trying to get him admitted to a hospital for evaluation. It took five days but she succeeded. On March 25, 2009, she went with him to Southwest Mental Health Center. ""I had never seen anything like I did that night,"" Stephanie recalls. Daniel's mood changed every second. He was happy, sitting next to his mother. Then, suddenly, he was under a table, clinging to a leg and crying. He ran around the room, announced he could fly. Then he stopped and looked at his mother: Mom, did you know I can see through doors? To Daniel, all of it was real. ""Patient reports he started hearing voices within the last week that he describes as multiple voices, mainly telling him to hurt his brother and specifically to stab him with a sharp object,"" the hospital evaluation said. ""Also telling him to hurt self. Prevents acting on these commands by hurting self or doing things with other objects.""

						Daniel was hospitalized for two weeks. His diagnosis: type 1 bipolar disorder, compounded by episodes of psychosis. 
Stephanie went to Barnes & Noble and bought nearly every book they had on bipolar disorder. She learned to understand what she had witnessed. Daniel's impulsive urges, his sudden bursts of energy fit the description of mania; his extreme lows matched the depression that accompanies bipolar disorder. The voices and visions her son described met the definition for psychosis.
Stephanie also grappled with something the hospital report hinted at: Guilt that her recent divorce from Daniel's stepfather had scarred a boy who'd never known his own father.
Daniel suffered from a lack of self-esteem, and he was ""likely to feel he lacks control and things happen to him,"" the report said. ""This could be influenced by the early 'loss' of his biological father and more recently the reported relational loss with his stepfather."" 
Stephanie renewed the pledge she'd made to her son on the day he was born. ""Daniel will never know how heartbreaking it was to watch him spiral up and down in a matter of seconds,"" she wrote in her journal, ""but he will know that no matter how hard it gets, I will always be there to pick him up.""
Her son understood for the first time that he suffered from mental illness. ""I can tell you how I felt,"" Daniel says. ""I was really, really scared.""
That year, Stephanie took the summer off to spend time with her boys. She bonded with them over fishing. ""I was the only mom out there,"" she says. The other boys all had their fathers in tow. Stephanie brags: ""We caught more fish than anyone else.""

						But by year's end, Daniel was in the hospital again. His episodes changed with every medication regimen. Drug combinations that were meant to control his state of mind seemed only to make his condition worse. 
The frequency of hospitalizations soon picked up.
The year 2010 was marked by four, and in 2011 there were five, including a 90-day court-ordered commitment. 
That was one of the toughest for Stephanie. The doctor suggested that route because outpatient therapy wasn't working.
Agreeing to a court commitment meant a loss of control. He'd be away for three months minimum.
In a way, she felt relief. Her son was where he needed to be, getting professional care, and she had time to breathe. She recalibrated and devised a long-term plan for Daniel.  She taught a class for medical assistants at a local trade school and continued working full-time.
But she couldn't help but wonder: Am I doing the right thing?
She visited Daniel every day for the first two weeks. She fretted the staff would deem her a bad mother if she didn't show up. 
But the visits were awful. Daniel hurled insults at her, said he hated her. Once, he threw a chair at her during a family session. He accused her of wanting to get rid of him. Every time, she left the hospital more miserable than when she entered. ""I dreaded going there instead of being happy to see him."" 
She dubbed the stroll from the hospital to her car in the parking lot ""the walk of shame.""
It didn't help that her siblings weren't supporting her. They thought she exaggerated Daniel's problems. Initially, so did Jose.They met at the trade school, where Jose was teaching, too. Stephanie told him up front about her son's illness.
If you want to run, she said, go right ahead.
They've been together two years now.
When a child suffers from an ""invisible"" illness, Jose says, ""You just have a hard time accepting that there's something wrong."" 
""Once I understood better,"" he says, ""that's when it got easier.""
But he adds, ""I don't think everyone can do it.""
Jose runs his own air conditioning business and can rush home when needed. He has filled a void in Daniel's life. The first hospitalization occurred exactly one year after Daniel's stepfather left. And every year since, that anniversary has triggered an episode resulting in hospitalization.
It's taken time to build trust, but Daniel now calls Jose ""Dad.""
Not only has Jose not turned and run, but he embraces the messy life of raising a teenager, one who happens to be mentally ill. Many people, he says, don't view those with mental illness as human; they're freaks, crazies, even monsters. Other people, Jose says, have this Hollywood vision of mental illness: It's difficult but then -- ta-da -- everything is fine. 
""The reality is people have to live with it for a lifetime,"" he says. ""The illness doesn't end when the credits roll. If you don't have the resolve or the stamina to handle it, you're in a lot of trouble.""
In real life, the script gets ripped up. Daniel was hospitalized for two weeks. His diagnosis: type 1 bipolar disorder, compounded by episodes of psychosis. Stephanie went to Barnes & Noble and bought nearly every book they had on bipolar disorder. She learned to understand what she had witnessed.

On a day in late June, Uncle Joe's custom-made barbecue pit, complete with a bottle opener the shape of Texas, covers Stephanie's front lawn. Three massive smokers house a Texas-sized feast: 80 pounds of brisket, platters of sausage links, nine dozen ears of corn, and heaps of barbecued cabbage. More than 100 relatives mingle in and around Stephanie's house to celebrate the 63rd birthday of her mother, Rosa. It's as much a goodbye party as it is a birthday celebration. Rosa's cancer is progressing. Danielâs family attends a Catholic healing mass for his grandmother, Rosa, who is battling brain cancer. The family lives in a modest four-bedroom ranch in a working-class neighborhood in suburban San Antonio. Stephanie's living room has four framed photographs on the wall, including one of the children with this motto: ""Family: Other things may change us, but we begin and end as a family."" Outside, the children play on an inflatable water slide. Relatives scarf up the food at tables covered with floral prints. When supper is done, everyone's attention turns to a television set on the patio. Images of a vibrant Rosa with her daughters and son flash across the screen. Rosa sits nearby but is too weak to say much. She waves to everyone and thanks them for their love. Laughter fills the backyard. Tears roll down faces, too. Among those captivated by the display is Daniel. He almost left the family nine months earlier. That's when he tried to kill himself. He'd gotten into an argument with his mother about breaking curfew. She said he could no longer be trusted. His response: Gulping down every pill he could get his hands on. Stephanie and Jose rushed him to the hospital. It took 10 men in the emergency room to hold Daniel down. Let me die! he screamed. The suicide attempt turned the tide for Stephanie's family. Her mother and sisters could no longer ignore the severity of his illness. At the hospital, everyone wept except for one person: Stephanie. ""I didn't want him to see me break, because if I broke down it would make his situation a lot worse."" On this night, after guests leave, Stephanie's sisters talk about their guilt for abandoning her and their ignorance of mental illness. Lamar Enriquez is the oldest sister and knows the pain of a loved one going untreated. Her husband of 13 years shot himself in the head last year. ""That's what scares me about Daniel,"" she cries, ""because he's only 14. I wouldn't want my sister to go through what I went through."" Mari De La Cerda had an awakening after Daniel twice went into psychosis while she was babysitting. ""When it happened, it was scary. Very scary, because I didn't know what was going through his mind. ""I don't know how my sister handles it,"" she says. ""But we're here for her. Now, we totally understand."" Adds Chel Ruiz, Stephanie's youngest sister: ""You have to reach that point and realize and accept that he does have a problem. That's the hardest part."" The most striking story comes from a family friend. His 11-year-old son told Daniel he planned to hang himself because his mother left home. Don't do it. You've got people who love you, Daniel told him. I love you and your daddy loves you. The father fights back tears. ""I thank God for him being my son's friend,"" he says. ""The way I look at it, Daniel is an angel."" Above Daniel's bed hang a crucifix, a drawing of him swinging a baseball bat and a postcard from New York City. A hand-written banner for his favorite television show scrawls across the room. ""The Walking Dead,"" it says. Clothes overflow drawers. Five baseball mitts sit in a carton on top of books and accumulated junk. Neatness isn't Daniel's strong suit. In that way â and others -- he's like most teens. His passions are music, dancing, basketball, video games. Martial arts is one of his favorite activities â it helps channel his thoughts in a positive fashion. He hopes to become a UFC fighter one day. Daniel also knows he's different from most other teens -- in a big way. ""I've seen like bodies on the floor when they're not even there,"" he says. ""If I look up in the sky and I'm outside, it's like everything's just dark, like the sky is red and I see demons flying everywhere. ""When I hear voices, it's hard to like deal with it because you're going crazy, because you don't know what to do."" His mental illness is a terrible thing, he says, not just for him but his whole family. ""I hate when it happens. Like I hate it. I hate it,"" he says.  ""I don't like having a mental illness because it hurts my mom, it hurts my brother and it hurts my dad. It's just, I don't like it."" He's afraid he will have to deal with the hallucinations for the rest of his life, because ""I should be growing out of it by now."" He doesn't want to harm people. He averts his anxiety by running around the neighborhood, pacing in the backyard and cutting his arm, which brings relief. He punches walls and kicks the fence out back so as not to carry out the voices' commands. Daniel dislikes going to the hospital, ""but I have to get stable,"" he says. ""It's better than hurting someone."" Daniel and his youngest brother play together in the family SUV. Daniel doesnât like having his siblings see his episodes. âI hate it,â he says. Five medications attempt to regulate his mood swings, control his anxiety, tamp down the episodes of psychosis. The family takes safety precautions. Guns are no longer kept in the house. Sharp knives are out of reach. Stephanie sent her youngest son to live with his father for a year while she got Daniel treatment. Now, with four children in the home, Daniel is not left alone with the others. That requires extensive planning and coordination. Daniel's psychiatrist, Corey Hough, works with him to pinpoint what exactly causes his anxiety and triggers his episodes. ""One of our big goals is to get him to identify when he's heading that direction, rather than wait until he's already there and already feeling like he wants to hurt himself,"" says Hough, a psychiatrist at the Clarity Child Guidance Center, the facility where Daniel has been hospitalized the most. Daniel's suicide attempt was a cry for help, he says. ""When you have individuals with bipolar and they have an elevated mood and they're manic, they're very impulsive and reckless,"" he says. ""Something doesn't go their way, and they'll go and drink a bottle of pills. They don't really put any thought into it â and that's a very risky situation and that's something Daniel has done."" School acts as his biggest stressor. Daniel worries about fitting in. He struggles to concentrate. The start of the school year might bring anxiety to any kid, Hough says, but for Daniel it means he worries about it constantly. ""It takes over a significant part of his day, just thinking about what's going to happen,"" Hough says. He describes Daniel as a ""very sweet kid"" who is outgoing, friendly and personable. Most people with mental illness deny they have a problem. The fact Daniel not only recognizes his wild mood swings, but is also ""very willing to discuss what's going on,"" signifies a major step toward getting better. ""To have to deal with some of the things he has to deal with â the hallucinations, the thoughts of hurting himself, the anxiety â none of those are pleasant feelings. And he's done a very good job of articulating how he's feeling and communicating to myself and his mom and to his family of what's going on."" What about his thoughts of harming siblings? Hough explains it is ""more of a control thing."" ""Fantasizing in his head of hurting people that piss him off helps make him feel better. It's not that he wants to do it; he doesn't. It's his way of sort of coping with it and coping with the moment."" What pushes a person across that edge, to act on the voices' commands, remains the great unknown in psychiatry. ""I don't have a crystal ball,"" Hough says. ""I can't say for sure what happens when a patient leaves my office."" The protocol is to err on the side of caution. A family must take measures around the home, and the psychiatrist must recognize when hospitalization is needed. Hough remains optimistic for Daniel. If Hough can help him better identify the triggers and minimize his medication, there will be success. ""I want to get him through high school,"" he says. ""I'd like for him to go on and do what he'd like to do."" But that will take time. Stephanie is resting in bed ahead of her overnight shift on a Friday night in August when Daniel walks in. Two of his siblings have been teasing him. A rage is building inside, he says. Stephanie tells Daniel to take some melatonin to take the edge off his anxiety. He leaves the room, takes the medicine but soon returns. This time is different. A dead serious look spreads across his face, and his pupils are dilated. Stephanie has never seen her boy like this. I'm going to hurt them, Mom, he says. Stephanie springs from bed. Well, baby, let's go to the hospital. She gathers her stuff and calls the Laurel Ridge Treatment Center, the closest hospital to the family's home. Bring him as soon as possible, she's told. She hops into the family SUV. Daniel gets in the passenger seat. It's only the second time she's driven him to the hospital by herself during an episode. She keeps an eye on the road and one eye on her boy. He sits quietly in the front seat, but it's clear he's still agitated. She finally engages.  You had thoughts of hurting the kids. Do you still have those feelings? Actually I still do, he says. The drive becomes a blur. Four days later, Stephanie returns to the hospital for a family session with Daniel and his counselor. But first she meets with the counselor alone. She speaks of her stress â caring for her dying mother, trying to help her son, making ends meet. The counselor reassures her that's enough pressure to make anyone implode. ""That's a lot to go through,"" the counselor says. ""You're not getting a break at all. You're go, go, go. You have to be on 24/7. And it's like to the point of, 'Who is taking care of you?'"" Stephanie utters: ""Uh-huh."" ""That has to be frustrating. I know it is,"" the counselor says. Stephanie bursts into tears. The counselor stresses the positive â that Daniel is keenly aware of the things going on with him and that he seeks his mother's help when he can't handle his thoughts. Not too many children, especially those with mental illness, have that type of relationship with a parent. ""You know, if you find any encouragement in the fact you're doing a great job with Daniel, he's a great kid."" Daniel enters the room and first explains what happened with the most recent episode. ""I guess I was mad that the kids were home because of the way they treat me."" How do they treat you? ""Well, they treat me like I'm stupid and then they just do every little thing to bother me. They bring me into their arguments, when I don't want to be in their arguments."" As he speaks, Stephanie cries. ""Are you OK?"" he asks his mom. ""Yeah,"" she says. Stephanie tells the counselor that she and Jose have spoken with the children about the need to go easy on Daniel â that normal sibling spats can easily get overblown. The family will need to address it further. ""We can try it,"" Daniel says, ""but honestly I don't think it will work."" Mother and son then have a heart-to-heart. She begins with the news she's received while he's been in the hospital. ""First of all, you passed into the eighth grade,"" she says. ""Aww, I did. Yes!"" ""I'm just worried about you starting a new grade,"" she continues, ""and getting frustrated so easily with the work and it being stressful at home. So we need to figure out how you're going to be able to have a normal school life."" ""I know I've said this before,"" Daniel says, ""but I know I didn't try last year. But I'm kind of tired of that, too. Honestly, it's like since I came here, I've realized a lot of things. I've gotten mad over stupid crap. ""I want it to stop."" ""It only stops when it comes from you,"" his mother says. ""You are the one that has to initiate stopping it."" ""Yeah, that's what I'm going to do,"" Daniel says. ""I'm going to try to stop, and I'm going to try to work harder, like the hardest I've ever done before, which is nothing actually."" The counselor advises him to draw up an action plan, and Daniel agrees. Stephanie bids farewell to her son. Leaving Daniel behind in the hospital is no longer a walk of shame. It's become part of the healing process. The day Daniel comes home, Stephanie and Jose call a family meeting. First they talk with Daniel at the table before calling the other three children into the room. It's a tricky conversation. Jose and Stephanie try to shield Daniel's siblings from the severity of their brother's illness. They don't want them to know everything because then they will be afraid of him. ""We have to figure out ways to discourage behavior"" that sets Daniel off, Stephanie told me the day before, ""without saying, 'You drive Daniel crazy.'"" Stephanie sits at the head of the table with Daniel at the far end, Jose next to him. The other three children take up their seats. Then, Jose begins. ""The certain comments you make, the certain things you say,"" Jose says. ""You guys can't do it anymore."" They've had this conversation before and it must end now, Jose says. ""When he says, 'Don't touch me,' don't touch him,"" Stephanie says. ""When he tells you, 'Get out of my room,' you need to just get out of his room. OK? ""He's not trying to be mean to you. He's not trying to be rude. It's just sometimes he doesn't feel well. OK?  It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Sometimes, he just has a bad day and he's not in the mood to be picked on."" Jose: ""The thing is you take it to a point where you don't realize how upsetting that is, especially to Daniel. You may get upset, but it's not as bad as Daniel gets.""

						""There's a difference,"" Stephanie says.
Jose: ""And it has to do a lot with the way Daniel thinks. You doing that to another person â it's still not right, but it has far less of an effect on that person than it does Daniel.""
The three siblings remain quiet.
Earlier, Daniel told his parents the other children hate him. ""That's how he feels. He really feels you guys don't like him,"" Stephanie says.
""We can't have that anymore,"" adds Jose. ""Do you guys get it? Are we going to have this conversation again?'""
One of his brothers interjects. ""But Daniel has told me he hated me.""
""No, I haven't,"" snaps Daniel.
""Yes, you have.""
""I'm not going to get in an argument,"" Daniel responds. ""I'm not going to even argue.""
He tosses his hands in the air and then puts them down. Daniel doesn't like having an episode in front of his siblings. He looks for ways to divert his thoughts, and it's clear he's trying to contain his agitation.
Stephanie works to calm him. ""If that's the case, then I think you guys all should apologize to each other.""
Daniel stands up and walks into the kitchen. 
""And let bygones be bygones and start fresh,"" Stephanie continues. 
Daniel heads toward the front door.
""Daniel!"" Stephanie screams.
The door slams. Daniel is gone.
""You have to understand that you're not better than anybody else,"" Jose tells the kids. ""That's the biggest thing: We always try to take very good care of you guys. Don't make anybody feel bad. Don't make anybody feel that they're not as good as you.""
The meeting is already over when Daniel returns 10 minutes later. But worry will occupy Stephanie the rest of the night.
""If we're asleep and he does something, you know, that's just one of my fears,"" she says.
""I've never had that fear as bad as I have it now because he's getting older, bigger, stronger."" ""There's a difference,"" Stephanie says. Jose: ""And it has to do a lot with the way Daniel thinks. You doing that to another person â it's still not right, but it has far less of an effect on that person than it does Daniel."" The three siblings remain quiet. Earlier, Daniel told his parents the other children hate him. ""That's how he feels. He really feels you guys don't like him,"" Stephanie says. ""We can't have that anymore,"" adds Jose. ""Do you guys get it? Are we going to have this conversation again?'"" One of his brothers interjects. ""But Daniel has told me he hated me."" ""No, I haven't,"" snaps Daniel. ""Yes, you have."" ""I'm not going to get in an argument,"" Daniel responds. ""I'm not going to even argue."" He tosses his hands in the air and then puts them down. Daniel doesn't like having an episode in front of his siblings. He looks for ways to divert his thoughts, and it's clear he's trying to contain his agitation. Stephanie works to calm him. ""If that's the case, then I think you guys all should apologize to each other."" Daniel stands up and walks into the kitchen. ""And let bygones be bygones and start fresh,"" Stephanie continues. Daniel heads toward the front door. ""Daniel!"" Stephanie screams. The door slams. Daniel is gone. ""You have to understand that you're not better than anybody else,"" Jose tells the kids. ""That's the biggest thing: We always try to take very good care of you guys. Don't make anybody feel bad. Don't make anybody feel that they're not as good as you."" The meeting is already over when Daniel returns 10 minutes later. But worry will occupy Stephanie the rest of the night. ""If we're asleep and he does something, you know, that's just one of my fears,"" she says. ""I've never had that fear as bad as I have it now because he's getting older, bigger, stronger."" Ten minutes to go, then it's sangria and flamenco dancing. The white Chevy Suburban eases to a halt at a stoplight. It's been a long day â a Catholic healing Mass for Stephanie's mother followed by dinner with cousins at a Mexican restaurant. Stephanie and Jose are nearing a long-awaited night on the town. School starts in two days and already stress is building in the household. ""I need to get out,"" Stephanie said at the start of the evening. Daniel paces the backyard during an episode of psychosis in August.  His mother tries to distract him from the voices he hears. She knows if the episode isnât brought under control within about 20 minutes, it can last hours â perhaps even days. The couple has deposited Jose's two children with grandparents. Stephanie's other son is with his biological father. A sitter is lined up for Daniel. All they have to do is drop him off at home. The SUV lurches forward. From the back seat, Daniel calls for his mother. ""I think I need my pills,"" he says. Stephanie perks up. They're almost home, she says, and he can take his medicine as soon as he walks through the door. The family outing took hours longer than expected. Stephanie didn't bring his nighttime dose. Daniel's tone turns almost shrill. ""I need them now."" Jose floors it. The Suburban hurtles down the highway â 65 mph, 70, 75. The couple have been through this drill before. They know it's key to distract Daniel from the voices he hears. Jose asks him about the priest's sermon on the strength needed to reach heaven. ""How do you get there?"" Stephanie asks. ""You get there ... "" Daniel places his hands on his head. ""I don't know."" ""My stomach hurts and my head hurts,"" he says. ""I'm dizzy and everything's blurry."" ""You've been in the car a little too long,"" Stephanie says. ""We're almost home,"" Jose says. ""My head hurts, too. Less than 10 minutes away."" Stephanie: ""What are you hearing?"" ""Just some weird voice,"" Daniel says. ""It just sounds weird. It doesn't sound like what I used to hear. It's just really, really different."" ""Just remember who is in control, right?"" Stephanie says. ""Yeah, I know, but it's just like I've never heard this before,"" Daniel says, his voice rising. ""It's creepy. It's different. I can't get it out of my head. The VOICE!"" Jose whips in and out of traffic. He glances from the road to the rearview mirror. Daniel grimaces and begins talking in a strained tone. The demons are showing him something. ""It's a picture of an arm with cuts on it."" ""Just take a deep breath,"" Stephanie says. ""Just remember, you're the one in control."" The boy moans. ""Are you all right?"" Stephanie says. ""I don't know,"" Daniel whines. See where to turn for help with mental illness in children, and find more mental health resources at Impact Your World. ""We've gone through too many of these things,"" Stephanie says, ""and every time you're all right. Right?"" ""Yeah,"" he says. Silence consumes the vehicle for 20 seconds. Then, Daniel screams. ""I'm seeing things."" His voice is hesitant, almost hushed with worry. ""OK,"" his mom says. ""What are you seeing?"" ""I looked out the window, and I saw a face pop up."" Daniel curls into a fetal ball. Moments later, Jose cuts the SUV down a side street, hooks a left and pulls up to the house. The truck comes to a halt in the family's front yard. The three jump out as if the vehicle is on fire. They have about 20 minutes to calm him, or the episode will last a couple of hours, perhaps even days. Stephanie ushers Daniel through the front door, into the living room, and onto the patio. Daniel sits in a rocking chair. He sways back and forth, his legs and arms fidgety. ""There's things all around,"" he says. Stephanie tries to soothe him, gives him his medication. ""What do you think triggered it?"" ""I don't know,"" he says. ""Do you want to walk around for a little bit?"" He rushes from the chair and paces in the backyard. ""I'm just trying to make it go away,"" he says. ""It's weird. It's like a conversation's going on."" He plops down at a picnic table. A neighbor's dog barks from behind a wooden fence. Daniel douses his head with a bottle of water. Stephanie and Jose ask him about a summer reading book, ""Moby Dick,"" to get him to think about something else â anything else. ""What do you remember?"" Stephanie says. ""What they have is an old man who wanted revenge,"" Daniel says. ""All he had was hate."" ""OK,"" Jose says. ""Who'd he have hate towards?"" Stephanie asks. ""Moby Dick, just because he took his leg off."" ""Who's Moby Dick?"" Stephanie says. ""The whale."" It's a little past 10 p.m., and the temperature hangs in the 90s, the Texas heat adding to the intensity of the moment. A few minutes pass, the medication kicks in and Daniel's mood eases. He heads inside to bed. Stephanie and Jose sigh. They've conquered this episode just in time, right around the 20-minute mark. But they're exhausted, exasperated. Stephanie's word is traumatized. ""It takes a lot out of you,"" Jose says. Stephanie: ""Yeah."" Jose: ""Even when it's simple like that."" Just as Ahab's quest for the great white whale seemed futile at times, so does the family's quest for normalcy. There will be no sangria or flamenco dancing tonight. Daniel began eighth grade two days later, on Monday, August 26, 2013. By the end of that week, anxiety overwhelmed him. He went back into the hospital for a six-day stay. But Daniel didn't give up on school. He returned to class, with renewed dedication. Success came by year's end. His grades rose from Cs and Ds to As and Bs. His therapy sessions went from twice a week to once a week. It's been nearly a year since his last hospitalization. All of this -- and Daniel's resolve to do better -- buoys his mother. ""We still have to get through the teenage years,"" she says, ""but he's in a good place."" Stephanie Escamilla agreed to let CNN into her home to document what it is like to raise a child with a serious mental illness. Her 14-year-old son, whose real name is not used in the story and whose face is obscured in the video and photographs, also agreed to participate. In June 2013, reporter Wayne Drash made the first of many visits to their home in San Antonio, Texas.  Video producer Evelio Contreras also spent weeks with the family. The dialogue and direct quotes in the story were heard by Drash or drawn from documents, videos or audio recordings. Italics are used in the instances where the dialogue was recalled by a participant and not witnessed by the reporter. Follow CNN's Wayne Drash on Twitter or contact him by e-mail.

11.18.2013 11:36 AM In the wake of any mass shooting, there's a predictable and justified burst of public outrage and sorrow followed by a series of do-something legislative proposals meant to prevent similar tragedies from ever occurring again. Depending on the political leanings of the politician or media figure offering the solution, the proposal often rests upon one of these twin assumptions: We must rid the world of the wrong kinds of weapons (i.e., ""assault weapons""), or, we must keep guns away from the wrong kinds of people (i.e., ""crazy people""). ""How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame from a national media machine that rewards them with wall-to-wall attention and a sense of identity that they crave, while provoking others to try to make their mark?""  asked Wayne LaPierre, official lightning rod of the National Rifle Association, in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary shooting. ""A dozen more killers, a hundred more? How can we possibly even guess how many, given our nation's refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill?"" Even the nation's premier gun lobby believes keeping guns away from the mentally ill is a good idea. It's a sensible-sounding proposal, a logical precaution. But some forensic psychiatrists, whose jobs include the task of identifying potentially violent individuals, say that targeting the mentally ill isn't as simple as it sounds. A recent Mayo Clinic study points out that mass shooters tend to meticulously plan their crimes weeks or months in advance, undermining the idea that the mentally ill simply ""snap"" and go on shooting rampages while also complicating the notion of effective gun control through gun registries, since a methodical planner has plenty of time to obtain weapons through illegal channels. A more basic problem with a strategy that targets mentally ill people is that the vast majority of them are not violent. When you control for substance abuse, a factor that exacerbates violence in all populations, only about 4.3% of people with a ""severe"" mental illness are likely to commit any sort of violence, according to a University of Chicago study. The violence rate among those with a ""non-severe"" mental illness is about equal to that of the ""normal"" population. ""In the absence of a history of violence or any of the other risk factors, it is impossible to predict who will become violent,"" says Stephen K. Hoge, a forensic psychiatrist at Columbia University. ""If we put doctors in the position of acting on behalf of the government or acting on behalf of social control, then that undermines the therapeutic mission."" In other words, by targeting and stigmatizing the mentally ill, especially in the absence of a coherent risk-identification strategy, the effect may be to discourage people who need help from seeking it, while also stripping away the rights of a huge group of people who will likely never commit a violent act. California is the vanguard of the gun registry movement in the U.S. The Attorney General's office maintains a database called the  ""Armed Prohibited Persons System"" (APPS), which identifies three groups of people whose guns should be confiscated: Individuals with a documented history of violence, convicted felons/wanted persons, and people with a ""severe mental illness,"" as defined by the state. Lumping the broad category of ""mentally ill people"" in with criminals and violent abusers can ensnare innocent and seemingly harmless individuals in an overly expansive dragnet. Take Lynette Phillips, a suburban California housewife who suffers from anxiety disorder. She encountered the APPS after a trip to Aurora Charter Oak Hospital's psych ward resulted in her involuntary commitment. Phillips claims she voluntarily checked herself into the hospital after a bad reaction to a new medication and that the involuntary commitment was an error made by an overzealous nurse. Representatives from Aurora Charter Oak declined to comment on the story, but she was released before the full 72-hour hold, and a  letter from Phillips' personal psychiatrist confirms some of the details in her version of events, including the fact that she sought treatment herself. But the involuntary commitment was enough to put Phillips on the government radar and make her an Armed Prohibited Person. A few days after she returned home, armed officers from the California Department of Justice entered her house in order to confiscate a gun she'd purchased as a gift for her husband. Upon finding more than one firearm in the house, the agents took all of the Phillips' guns and ammunition. They had no warrant. The CA DOJ would not comment on this story. ""They didn't need to do that,"" says Lynette's husband, David, who described a scene in which the officers spread all of their guns and ammunition on the front yard as the neighborhood watched. ""They embarrassed us in front of the neighbors."" The Phillips have no criminal record, history of violence, or documented substance abuse problems. But it was only with the help of an attorney that they were able to get their guns back from the state after several months of effort, and only under the condition that David keep the guns in a safe that's inaccessible to Lynette. They did not return any of the seized ammo. The Phillips have vowed never to let government agents into their home without a warrant again, and Lynette remains shaken by the experience. Since its inception in 2001, the APPS program has resulted in the seizure of more than 11,000 guns. ""To the extent that society continues to vilify the mentally ill and scapegoat them as the primary cause of gun violence, is a major step backward,"" says Hoge.

hidden beyond reach of accountability. In 1975 those who were experimenting
with legal abduction and imprisonment were finally and officially furloughed. It
has been decades since Alice investigated the matter of difficult and
disruptive types in need of 'safe time'. ""They've a temper,"" said Humpty
Dumpty, ""some of them -- particularly verbs, they're the proudest; however, I can
manage the whole lot of them!"" Today things are different. Those 'at risk' of
doing harm to self or others can be competently assessed in advance. Apart from
that, however, the difficult are trending more dangerous, and the dangerous are
more difficult to restrain. Logic, after all, is vital to nonsense. Alice in Wonderland Once upon a time people could be so selfish and
self-absorbed as to finagle the removal of a 'difficult' person to a mental
ward. ""'I'm not a serpent!' said
Alice indignantly. 'Leave me alone!'"" It worked simply enough: three votes and you're
off -- to see the wizard and the white coats whose professional facilities
delivered wide variations in care; and doubtless kept raps on recidivism,
psychotic episodes, malaise, even escapes.
I once personally ushered a paranoid schizophrenic escapee to a nearby
hospital, where the desk person looked at my charge and said, ""Oh, this is the
nut case."" Whereat my charge bolted, making my task much more difficult but at
all events useless, because pointless. Then and there I was officially educated:
the system was hopelessly rigged, mostly in the wrong ways. The high arbiter of law in Wonderland was called, after an
old English court of equity, the Star
Chamber.    It was because the Chamber justices
were genuinely outraged at the license taken with innocents and unfortunates
alike that the victims were rewarded with law's equivalent of the lottery (O'Connor
v. Donaldson,
  422
U.S. 563, 1975).
As for the law, it got a bloody nose for the Chamber's misplaced wisdom. To be
fair, thirty years ago the psychiatric community was pretty sorry. Back then, Alice
wasn't comfortable forcing the difficult to undergo long-term treatment. That
would change. But first, she reviewed the legal facts. From the decision (see
also a cumulative case summary here)
-- 1) But the mere
presence of mental illness does not disqualify a person from preferring his
home to the comforts of an institution. 2) Mere public
intolerance or animosity cannot constitutionally justify the deprivation of a
person's physical liberty. 3) A State cannot constitutionally confine ""a
non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by
himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends"". Determining 'at risk' status fully and competently addresses
the first two concerns. The third presumes what is preposterous, namely, that a
'non-dangerous' person can be presumed to live safely in freedom without
medications. Excuse me? ""'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice
desperately; 'he's perfectly idiotic!'"" And mental illness is just a walk in the
park even absent psychotropics? Did anyone ask their families? It is this,
Alice fumed, that overturned about a thousand years of legal tradition. Wonderland was soon enough in worse condition than the
penguins and polar bears; the ice pack on which Alice floated was melting
beneath her feet, whole chunks falling away with every mass shooting. Cracks were
widening, inevitably isolating her still further as her family (and countless thousands
of others), no longer assured of treatment for a difficult relative, discovered
a small army of hungry orcas with 'wave-hunting orgy' on the brain. Preserving
the luxury to dodge responsibility was taking its toll. ""'But I don't want to
go among mad people', Alice remarked."" Others get religion,
Alice gets law Alice took aim at conventional legal learning, determined to
learn the way law was intended to be learned: from initial examination of ethico-moral
common denominators (jurality) for 'probative' mythic value, followed by a study
of parallels between theory and practice under differing contexts. She learned from Lord Coke's (1552-1634) reporting on Judge
Littleton that when a cow -- at the time the single most important possession of
a family -- wandered off through damaged fences or neglected stone walls, therein
was created a marvelously easy way for neighbors to turn violent and for violence
to spawn feuds.    Alice drew a parallel
between those refusing needed psychotropics and homesteaders refusing to
exercise the responsibility to maintain their fences and walls. Medications,
Alice saw, were the walls and fences separating healthy from troubled
dispositions -- neighboring pastures of the mind. She proudly recited from
Robert Frost's Mending Wall    -- Good fences
make good neighbors. Why 
do they make good neighbors? Isn't it Where there are cows? Next Page  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6 (Note: You can view every article as one long page if you sign up as an Advocate Member, or higher).  Rate It |

12.12.2013 9:45 AM A year after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in which 20 children and six adults were killed, just 16 percent of Americans believe stricter gun control laws would have been most effective in preventing the tragedy. While this does not necessarily mean they do not support stricter gun rules, it demonstrates that their priorities lie elsewhere. When asked to select the most important factor that may have prevented the Newtown shooting, nearly a third of respondents, 27 percent, told the Reason-Rupe poll that better mental health treatment is the most important factor in preventing the tragedy at Sandy Hook. Twenty-two percent say better parenting is most critical, and 20 percent say having armed school officials or armed guards on site would have been the most likely way to prevent the tragedy. The fourth most preferred approach was stricter gun control laws, selected by 16 percent of respondents in the Reason-Rupe poll. Reducing the violence in media and video games was cited by eight percent of Americans as the best way to prevent the school shooting. Republicans place the greatest importance on better mental health treatment (26 percent), armed guards on site (25 percent), and better parenting (22 percent). Only one in 10 Republicans say that stricter gun control is the most important factor that could have been used to prevent the Sandy Hook tragedy. Similarly, independents say better mental health care is the most important factor that could have prevented the Newtown tragedy (31 percent), followed by better parenting (23 percent), and armed guards at school (18 percent). Just 12 percent of independents say stricter gun control is most important when considering what measures may have prevented the Newtown shooting. Democrats say tightened gun control is the most important factor (24 percent), followed by enhanced mental health care (23 percent) and better parenting and armed officials on site (tied at 19 percent). Nationwide telephone poll conducted Dec 4-8 2013 interviewed 1011 adults on both mobile (506) and landline (505) phones, with a margin of error +/- 3.7%. Princeton Survey Research Associates International executed the nationwide Reason-Rupe survey. Columns may not add up to 100% due to rounding. Full poll results, detailed tables, and methodology found here. Sign up for notifications of new releases of the Reason-Rupe poll here.

Mental health is the avenue to gun confiscation.. Politicians and Media push gun control in a dangerous and dishonest manner.. http://fff.org/explore-freedom…..tally-ill/ Allowing licensed concealed carry in schools wasn’t even asked? Concealed carry in schools would be the cheapest, and most effective method at preventing mass shooting at school. Too bad the left won’t let go of the Kultur war long enough to allow it. CC on campus would generate revenue for the state, as you’d have some teachers and public paying the state license fee so that they could carry and defend their students & coworkers. Needless to say, any solution that would be effective, generate (voluntary) revenue for the state, and reinforce the natural right to self defense is DOA. Much better to attack natural rights, create potential killing grounds everywhere, and then point fingers in the most pious, dunderheaded way imaginable. if the state wants you to have rights, it will give you those rights. /prog and in keeping with the O-care theme: just because you like those rights doesn’t mean you can keep them. Plus, armed guards = jobs! Well, if you go with armed guards rather than concealed carry, you have to add staff, which means increasing union membership. Which, I have to conclude, is the true purpose of the public schools. 27% of respondents is closer to “a quarter of respondents” than “nearly a third of respondents”. Tighten it up Emily. This is precisely what Karl Kraus criticized journalists for. Hey, you stole my comment. 31% I might call “nearly a third,” but 27% feels way too low to ’round up’ like that. Emily doesn’t need to tighten up. Hubba hubba! This is why there are no female libertarians. Also why VP hates “us.” Just say 27%. How about starting with just improved mental services, then we can add other elements as necessary. That seems singularly unlikely to work even if you’re on board with greatly expanding what is a priori considered dangerous behavior. on paper, this sounds good. In practice, I have no idea how it works well. Involuntary committment is already a by-gone relic and even people like Laughner and the Aurora shooter were known to be unstable but nothing could be done with them because they had done nothing wrong. Didn’t the who episode begin with the involuntary commitment process of Lanza? Not sure how “improving” would have helped unless the guys in the white van got there before he started prying open that gun vault. The absurdity of this “more mental healthcare” rallying cry is that Lanza was a rich kid who had access to the best therapists money could buy. The problem isn’t a lack of access to psychologists and psychiatry; the problem is that severe anxiety such as his is a human problem that can’t be medicalized away by throwing money at it. You can repair a broken arm, a blocked artery, or a tumor; you can’t repair a personality that lives in constant fear of its environment or the chronic frustration, bitterness, and hopelessness that results from that, at least not by simplistic psychiatric means. If you’ve ever seen what anxiety-ridden adolescents go through, you would understand that the idea that we’re going to prevent more Lanzas (or Chos, or Holmeses, or…) by throwing money at public-health services is ridiculous. These are lifelong problems that result from cycles of despair, frustration, and bitterness–sticking an extra counselor in a school isn’t going to do anything substantial in preventing another massacre. the problem is that severe anxiety such as his is a human problem that can’t be medicalized away by throwing money at it. As a chronic sufferer of anxiety, I volunteer for this radical treatment. I understand that being treated with money may not cure my illness, but if it someday contributes to a cure, it will have been worth it to me. There are surely some reasonoids who would throw money at you were you to get up on the stage and take off all of your clothes very slowly. Or very quickly, depending. It does cure AIDS. Yeah, the mental health care thing is a bit of a canard. While some of the people who’ve perpetrate may have been mentally ill, an overwhelming majority of people who are mentally ill in any way do not go on shooting sprees, or even pose a threat to anyone else. In fact, most of the behavior involved in these shootings demonstrates rational thinking and planning, not kookoo bananas crazy time. Plus, what does “better mental health care” even mean in this context? Are we tip-toeing around involuntary commitment? Because that’s not a door I want to open with Progressives, frankly. Next thing you know flicking off someone who cuts you off on the highway will land you in the looney bin. I think to the extent that there is a problem, and I think that’s very, very debatable, we’re talking about situations that are so complex and unusual as to make generalization extremely difficult. Adam Lanza might have benefited from better parenting, but I don’t recall even a whisper of the Cho kid having any issues at home. It seems that in a lot of these cases the shooters are for whatever reasons somewhat isolated. They seem to be people who for one reason or another have difficulty forming close relationships, which makes it difficult or impossible for people to notice if they’re acting “funny”. Frankly, I think mitigation of the leaden variety is a more effective response. This strikes me as just another bullshit poll designed to fit the narrative. Here’s my take on it. Some people tend to blame the individual. Most likely they are mentally deranged. Its not the gun’s fault. Better (more involved) parents might have been able to see this coming and/or have secured the guns better. There’s a good chance that armed guards in the school could have prevented this but that may not be a valid solution (liberty, funding, etc). Has there been an uptick in school shootings that I wasn’t aware of, that we need to be DOOOOOING SOOOOOMETHING about? The thing about armed guards is, what are they going to be doing most of the time when there is no killing going on? That’s right, harassing kids for petty mischief. “Better mental health services” seems to include both “identify crazies and lack them up” as well as “more money for counseling and support” and also “limit regulations that restrict psychiatric drugs.” Difficult to know what people are reading into it. The local Social Security office for me is in Olympia, WA. There are probably 15-20 employees and maybe 40 clients in the office at any one time. It has a full-time guard on duty during office hours. I live walking distance to an elementary school. It has maybe 40 teachers and staff and I guess about 700 children. It not only has no guard but is advertised on a sign in front as a “gun-free zone.” Go figure. Please log in to post comments Billy Binion

115,http://www.mlive.com/living/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/12/charley_honey_weve_made_stride.html,"Grandville High School students spell ""Be Nice."" as part of an anti-bullying statement at the school's football field Friday, May 11, 2012. About 1,400 students participated in the event. (Cory Morse | Mlive.com) If you think schools aren’t doing enough to protect students from bullying, I wish you would have seen this: 50 high school students lining up in a gym to admit their hurts and fears. Prompted by a professional moderator, students stepped forward to acknowledge they’d been teased, abused and accused of being fat, nerdy, gay or otherwise not cool. They turned and faced their peers, who held hands over their hearts in support. Tears, hugs and words of comfort abounded. This powerful program at North Rockford Middle School was part of Rachel's Challenge, an international initiative named after Rachel Joy Scott, the first student killed in the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School. About 200 students and staff from Kent County schools took part in day-long November workshops funded by the Doug and Maria DeVos Foundation. It is the beautiful legacy of a 17-year-old girl who believed in the power of kindness. Thanks to Rachel’s positive vision and those who have put it to work, millions of students feel better about themselves and are better able to handle bullying. Some say it’s saved their lives. When it comes to battling bullying, schools are way ahead of where they were when I was in school. In the Sixties, you just quietly put up with the towel-snapping and verbal abuse. Stepping forward to admit your vulnerabilities would have been social suicide. Today, schools do much to help protect students from being abused and prevent real suicide. In reporting for School News Network, I've seen evidence such as a program at Northview High School that includes anti-bullying videos made by students themselves. And programs such as the ""Be Nice"" campaign, sponsored by the Mental Health Foundation of West Michigan, give students strength in numbers and proactive strategies. Sadly, while schools work to better protect their students, governments continue to fail miserably at protecting them from the perpetrators and weapons of mayhem: the heavily armed assailants who murdered 12 students and one teacher at Columbine, and killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. This Saturday, Dec. 14 marks a year since that horrific massacre in Newtown, Conn. sent shock waves through an America that thought it was beyond shock about mass shootings. Massacres at movie theaters, universities and houses of worship did not prepare us for a mentally disturbed 20-year-old mowing down first-graders with his mother's assault rifle.  Adam Lanza fired off 154 rounds in less than 10 minutes with a Bushmaster rifle before shooting himself, according to a report by the Connecticut state attorney. Surely now, many of us thought, something will be done to make it harder for unstable people like Lanza to get their hands on military-style weapons. If the slaughter of 6-year-olds doesn’t prompt us to tighten up our gun laws, nothing will. At this point, it appears nothing will. A federal task force assigned to recommend changes went nowhere, as the Senate refused even to expand existing background checks for gun buyers. This fall, two Colorado senators who voted to toughen that state’s gun laws were recalled. Meanwhile, Michigan educators are contending with the crazy fact that it's illegal to carry a concealed weapon into state schools, but legal for a concealed-weapons permit owner to openly carry a gun on his or her hip. Yep, read that again. It’s true. Rep. Andy Schor, D-Lansing, last January introduced a bill to close that loophole. It was referred to the state House Committee on Local Government, where it has sat untouched ever since like a bad fruitcake. Some gun-rights activists challenge schools whose policies prohibit guns in their buildings, arguing schools will be safer with armed, responsible adults. Superintendents I’ve talked to, such as Rockford’s Michael Shibler, disagree. So do I. It can be argued that having an armed police officer on site may make students safer, but allowing anyone in with a pistol is nuts. How is a secretary supposed to know the difference between a responsible gun owner and a crazed killer? Educators don’t want to take guns away from responsible owners, nor do they claim better gun laws alone will solve the problem. They are working to make their building entrances more secure, knowing Adam Lanza blasted his way through a locked door. They are working to spot students with mental problems, knowing Lanza slipped through the cracks. And they are training their staffs to be better prepared for the no-longer-unthinkable. Just because you can’t stop all mass killings doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything. As one police officer who patrols schools told me, “You have to try, because we’re talking about kids here. There’s nothing more important than keeping kids safe.” What do gun laws and protecting schoolchildren have to do with faith? Everything. All major faiths teach the sanctity of life and the loving nurture of children. If we don’t do everything possible to provide children a safe place to learn, we’ve failed one of life’s most basic duties. We’re doing a great job of trying to protect our children from bullying. But when it comes to gun policy, we deserve a big fat F.

Sandy Hook Parents' 'Parent Together' Pledge Nov. 25, 2013— -- intro: The gunman who opened fire on Sandy Hook elementary school last December, killing 20 students and six staff members, had collected mass murder memorabilia, including newspaper clippings, in his bedroom before the shooting. Stockpiled in the bedroom that he almost never left were news reports about school shootings, video games that allowed the user to role play a mass shooting, and grisly photos of a dead human, covered in blood and wrapped in plastic. There were also funny videos, pictures of hamsters, and videos of him playing Dance Dance Revolution. Lanza, 20, killed his mother at the home they shared on the morning of Dec. 14 before continuing onto the Sandy Hook school. There, he killed 26 people, mostly first graders, before taking his own life.

Kennedy assassination and America's gun culture Nov. 21, 2013 — -- The fevered debate about gun control that has flared over recent mass shootings across the U.S. echoes the debate heard after John F. Kennedy's assassination 50 years ago, and the language and arguments are jarringly similar. Nearly every major change to U.S. gun laws has come on the heels of a mass shooting, and the debate on guns in the U.S. raged in 1963 as a dozen firearm bills were introduced in the wake of Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963 assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald. Kennedy Assassination and America's Gun Culture. Watch a 1963 report here. The echo of the post-assassination debate came after the spate of mass shootings in the past 15 years, beginning with the massacre at Columbine and through last winter's tragedy in Sandy Hook, Conn.  The latter led to proposed gun control legislation that was ultimately defeated. The call for new gun control laws in 1963 stirred gun rights advocates of the era, including the National Rifle Association (NRA), to respond. According to an ABC News report in the days after Kennedy's murder, the NRA stated ""that gun restriction laws penalize the honest man and protect the criminal element. Even if you did ban all guns, criminals will find a way to get them."" Similarly, after the Sandy Hook shooting, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said that laws for gun-free school zones ""tell every insane killer in America that schools are their safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk."" Oswald had purchased his rifle, a Mannlicher-Carcano, for $12.78 through an ad placed in the NRA's American Rifleman magazine by a Chicago mail order house. A ban was introduced by Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., following Kennedy's assassination on mail order sales of rifles and shotguns. It wasn't until just after Robert Kennedy was killed in 1968 that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Gun Control Act into law, banning mail order sales of rifles and shotguns and prohibiting most felons, drug users and people found mentally incompetent from buying guns. At the time of Kennedy's assassination, 14 states required citizens to have a permit to carry a pistol or keep it in their homes. Gun laws have tightened since 1963, and today open carry laws still vary from state to state, with six states fully prohibiting the open carry of guns. A total of 12 states currently allow open carry without a permit, and 13 require some sort of permit from the gun owner. The remaining 17 states rely on local laws or have other restrictions in practice. Though it continuously hits obstacles, the ongoing battle for gun control in America was summed by President Obama the day after the legislation that grew out of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre failed: ""this effort is not over."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2013-11-21 11:15:14,Post-JFK Gun Debate Rages on Today,"law and legislation,gun control,firearms,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

The crowd seated in rows of wooden chairs included two busloads from Newtown, Conn., where one year ago Saturday a massacre of 26 children and staff took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School. CSM: Residents of Newtown, Conn., hope to avoid the intense media scrutiny that came a year ago Saturday, after the school shooting that shocked the world. Their focus will be on reflection, healing, and kindness. More politics and policy below the fold. As if to add insult to unspeakable tragedy, rarely is anyone punished when a child dies in this manner. Relatives of other gun violence victims from cities across the country joined the Connecticut group on a two-day trip to Washington, D.C., to highlight the annual deaths of tens of thousands of people by firearms. Their visit was capped by a vigil at the National Cathedral to remember victims of gun violence nationwide. Before the service began, the cathedral's bell rang for three minutes to represent the lives claimed by firearms every year. More than 700 well-wishers, including family of those slain at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, filled the cathedral, with many wearing green ribbons to symbolize the school.",2013-12-14 12:21:14,"Abbreviated Pundit Round-up: Newtown is a movement, not a moment","christians and christianity,religion and churches,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders,violence",115,http://www.dailykos.com
