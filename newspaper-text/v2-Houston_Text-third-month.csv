background checks acquire guns,1 many perhaps criminals use guns obtain theft black market or—as clinton admits—through straw purchasers straw purchasers people pass background checks buy guns criminals pass checks therefore achilles heel background check apparatus rendering expansions improvements system largely entirely pointless bureau alcohol tobacco firearms explosives…… clinton points instead fact national instant criminal background check system denied purchases large number people since inception 1998 however fails say relatively denied dangerous enough warrant prosecution failed background check stop dangerous person obtaining firearm means many people denied incorrectly ultimately denials reversed prohibiting person selling significant number personally owned guns clinton says would use presidential executive authority prohibit person selling significant number guns without federally licensed firearm dealer therefore clinton say number guns considers significant 2013 obama administration least considered whether possible arbitrarily require person sells 50 guns per year possess dealer license early 1990s gun control supporters supported legislation require person owned 20 guns obtain arsenal license cost 100 year however details beside point president authority obama wondered clinton still imagines federal law defines required licensed run background checks

us capability exists respect charleston clinton joins anti-gun activists media claiming suspect multiple murder emanuel a.m.e. church city earlier year criminal record prohibited acquiring gun fbi

purchases prevented altogether indefinite delays purchasers background checks assault weapons ban clinton previously said supports banning assault weapons large ammunition magazines thus saying
