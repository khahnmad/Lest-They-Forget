6,http://www.inquisitr.com/4260803/new-pulse-nightclub-massacre-footage-released-club-to-become-a-memorial-and-museum/,"On June 12, 2016, a lone gunman, Omar Mateen, walked into Orlando's Pulse nightclub and opened fire on patrons of the gay-friendly establishment. A total of 49 people were killed in the Pulse attack, thus making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. The brand new body camera (bodycam) footage was recently released by the Belle Isle Police Department in Orlando. The footage shows the moments when police entered the Pulse club from the vantage point of the officers responding to the attack. At the time, Omar Mateen was still alive and had cornered a group of survivors near the back of Pulse club. More than 30 videos were released that reveal the officers assessing the full extent of casualties. In one of the videos, we see footage from Officer Brandon Cornwell's bodycam as he enters Pulse club through a broken window. He immediately positioned himself behind a bar area as his fellow officers began yelling at Mateen. Suddenly we hear an officer screaming, followed by a torrent of gunfire from within Pulse. According to Orlando Police Chief John Mina, officers did not hit their target at this point, and Mateen did not return fire. An officer continued to shout instructions at Mateen.""You, in the bathroom, let me see your hands now. Come out with your hands up, or you will die.""   Law enforcement officials investigate at the Pulse gay nightclub where Omar Mateen killed at least 49 people in June 2016. [Image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images] More than 15 hours of footage was released to the public by the Orlando Sentinel, revealing scenes of chaos outside Pulse in the immediate aftermath of the initial attack. Below are some videos sourced from the Daily Mail, showing the first scene described above. Please note that sensitive viewers may find the following footage upsetting.  The bodycam attached to officer Graham Cage shows a colleague helping a person exit a bathroom inside Pulse and then proceeds to lead them down a hallway towards the street outside. At the time officers were not able to determine how many attackers were involved, so all Pulse patrons were treated with caution as potential suspects.""Hands up, both hands, put your hands up. Follow the sound of my voice. Come this way.""In different footage, people who were not injured can be seen fleeing the site of the massacre while also holding their hands in the air, as directed by officers. A police officer can be heard saying ""Lord Jesus, watch over me,"" as he approaches the gunman and the hostages. The following video shows survivors being searched by police outside the Pulse club, while other officers continue to help patrons away from the scene to safety.  It was moments after 2:00 a.m. when Omar Mateen entered Pulse nightclub carrying a SIG-Sauer MCX semi-automatic rifle, as well as a 9mm Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol. After claiming allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIS), Mateen opened fire inside Pulse, killing 49 people and injuring more than 58 survivors. Following a stand-off with police that lasted for three hours, Mateen was finally killed, and his hostages were safely led away from the scene. The owner of the Pulse nightclub, Barbara Poma, has announced that the Orlando-based gay establishment will now be turned into a memorial site and a museum in honor of those who died in the Pulse massacre. ABC News reported that Poma wanted the club to be a place where the families of those who were slain could find bereavement. Poma would also like to use the space to offer future generations the opportunity to be educated about the importance of tolerance in any society that is diverse and open.""What began as a place for fun and joy is now sacred ground. What was once our little corner... is now shared with the world.""   A woman lights a candle during a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. [Image by Daniel Munoz/Getty Images] So far Poma has not revealed details about the process of converting Pulse into a museum, or even when it will be open to the public. She believes the development and design of the Pulse museum should be led by the survivors, families of the victims, officers and medics who were on the scene, and the Orlando community.""The ultimate design and function will be decided by this community.""The onePULSE Foundation, founded by Barbara Poma, has offered to spearhead a fundraising initiative for the development and construction of the Pulse museum. The foundation's board is populated with various celebrities who are open members of the LGBTQI community. Singer Lance Bass and NBA star Jason Collins are among those sitting on the onePULSE board. Foundations that have constructed memorials to honor victims of previous terror attacks, such as the Oklahoma City and New York City memorials, have served as inspirations to Poma. She believes that the Pulse memorial will similarly act as a site where people will find solace and inspiration in the face of tragedy. Poma has indicated a desire to open a brand new nightclub but has not provided any details as yet. More bodycam footage from the night of the Pulse massacre can be viewed on the Orlando Sentinel website.

The “insufferably smug” Real Time host has joked that there should be a “mass shooting” at the Country Music Awards, called the Quran a “hate-filled holy book,” booked white supremacist Milo Yiannopoulos, and compared One Direction’s Zayn Malik to terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, even going so far as to ask him, “Where were you during the Boston marathon?” Maher takes pride in crossing the proverbial line, but on Friday’s episode of Real Time, he crossed the line, then set it on fire. During a conversation about adolescence and maturity, Maher told his guest, Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, that adults still dress up for Halloween in California, and whether the same thing happens in the Cornhusker State. SASSE: “It’s frowned upon. We don’t do that quite as much.” MAHER: “I’ve got to get to Nebraska more.” SASSE: “You’re welcome. We’d love to have you work in the fields with us.” MAHER: “Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house n*gga.” The line drew some laughs from the in-studio audience, but mostly groans. Sasse didn’t directly address Maher using the derogatory term for a black slave who worked in the master’s house instead of in the field, although the Senator awkwardly fumbled, “No, it’s not a joke.” (He also responded to a tweet about the interview, but made no mention of the brewing controversy.)

14,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/h8hYYu1fTf0/,"At least five people were killed Monday after a disgruntled employee opened fire at his former workplace near Orlando, authorities said. The 45-year-old shooter, John Robert Neumann Jr., fatally shot himself shortly after killing five employees at Fiamma Inc. about 8 a.m., Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference. Neumann Jr., who lived alone, was an Army veteran who was discharged in 1999, authorities said. The gunman had been fired in April and had been previously accused of battering another employee at work, authorities said. Police said they do not believe the worker involved in the previous altercation was harmed in the shooting Monday. “He was a disgruntled employee,” Demings said. About a dozen people were inside the office at Fiamma Inc. — a worldwide business, primarily known for selling accessories for recreational vehicles and trailers — at the time of the shooting rampage. Eight people survived. One survivor told deputies the shooter spared her life and told her to leave, authorities said. Demings identified the victims as 69-year-old Robert Snyder, 44-year-old Brenda Motanez-Crespo, 53-year-old Kevin Clark, 46-year-old Kevin Lawson, and 57-year-old Jeffrey Roberts. Most of the victims were shot in the head and many were shot multiple times, the sheriff said. The suspect was armed with a handgun, a “very large” hunting knife and a smaller knife, although it does not appear he used either knife, police said. His criminal history is “minor” in nature and includes charges of possession of marijuana, DUI and misdemeanor battery. Authorities do not believe the incident is related to terrorism. Almost one year has passed since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history played out in Orlando. Last June, a lone gunman killed 50 people at the Pulse nightclub.

16,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/05/florida-workplace-shooting/,"Trending: By Terrance Harris and Mike Schneider, The Associated Press ORLANDO, Fla. — A man who was fired from a Florida awning factory in April returned Monday with a semi-automatic pistol and methodically killed five people, then took his own life at the sound of an approaching siren, authorities said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings identified the shooter as John Robert Neumann Jr., a 45-year-old Army veteran who lived alone and did not appear to belong to any type of subversive or terrorist organization. The shooting began after Neumann slipped through a rear door into the cavernous Fiamma Inc. factory, an area larger than two football fields where awnings are stitched together for recreational vehicles. He paused at least once to reload. “My experience tells me that this individual made deliberate thought to do what he did today. He had a plan of action,” said the sheriff, who wouldn’t say why Neumann was fired. The gunman “had a negative relationship with” at least one of the victims. This March 19, 2010 booking photo made available by the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office, shows John Robert Neumann Jr., who was arrested for possession of marijuana. Neumann killed several people and then took his own life at an Orlando, Fla., awning factory Monday, June 5, 2017.“He was certainly singling out the individuals he shot,” Demings said, adding that most victims were shot in the head. Some were shot multiple times. State and federal law enforcement officers converged on the industrial park in Orlando shortly after 8 a.m. after a woman ran out and called 911 from a tile business across the street, said Yamaris Gomez, that store’s owner. “All she kept saying was he was holding a gun and told her to get out,” Gomez said. That woman had been hired after Neumann was fired in April, so he probably did not recognize her and knew she was not a former co-worker, Deming said. Searching for a motive, deputies cordoned off a trailer park in Maitland, where Neumann lived alone in a mobile home on a busy road next to a funeral home, a used car lot and a dog-grooming business. Like the awning factory, it’s far from Orlando’s famous theme parks. Deming said investigators also are looking through any social media postings for clues. Neumann was honorably discharged in 1999 and did not have a concealed weapons permit, the sheriff said. Arnie Boyd, who lives in the same trailer park, said Neumann was not particularly social. “Every once in a while, he would ride his bike around and that’s it,” Boyd said. “We would speak only once in a while.” The dead were identified as Robert Snyder, 69; Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44; Kevin Clark, 53; Jeffrey Roberts, 57; and Kevin Lawson, 46. Authorities had confronted Neumann once before at the factory, when he was accused of battering a co-worker in June 2014. But no charges were filed, and that co-worker was not among Monday’s victims, the sheriff said. In a 2014 incident report, Neumann’s co-worker said Neumann punched him in the back of the head when he approached, knocking him to the ground. But the co-worker later changed his story, saying that Neumann had chased him and then hit him on the back of the head. Neumann had a record of minor crimes, none violent, dating back nearly 20 years. Most involved traffic violations — driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, giving a deputy a false name and leaving the scene of a hit-and-run involving property damage. Fiamma calls itself one of the largest manufacturers of awnings for camper vans, motor coaches and sport utility vehicles. Shelley Adams said her sister, Sheila McIntyre, called her from the company’s bathroom during the shooting and kept repeating, “My boss is dead. My boss is dead.” Officers arrived two minutes after being dispatched, the sheriff said. The FBI also responded, said Ron Hopper, who runs the FBI’s Orlando office. And while five people were killed, “seven others’ lives were saved due to the quick actions of the officers who arrived on the scene today,” said Special Agent Danny Banks of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Authorities had no reports of any specific threats the gunman made to people at the company or anyone else, but that’s why people need to alert authorities whenever they learn of anything that could lead to violence, Banks said. “If people see something that seems abnormal, they need to say something,” Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs added. The latest government statistics indicate that fatal workplace shootings have ticked upward in the United States. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a 2 percent rise between 2014 and 2015 to 417 cases. Among those, fatal shootings rose more sharply, by 15 percent. Sen. Bill Nelson called for more action to address mental health issues. He noted that next Monday will mark a year since the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The attack at the Pulse club killed 49 people and wounded dozens more. “The city of Orlando, which is still healing from the Pulse massacre, has seen too much violence this past year,” the Florida Democrat said in a statement. Republican Gov. Rick Scott asked “all Floridians to pray for the families impacted by this senseless act of violence.” ___ Associated Press Writer Freida Frisaro in Miami contributed to this report. ___ The story has been edited to correct Jacobs to Orange County mayor, not Orlando mayor, and the spelling of the sheriff’s surname to Demings, not Demmings.

The BBC says officials have told people to stay away from the area; according to The Telegraph, the main square near Paris’ tourist attraction has been evacuated. David Rahul Metreaum, a witness, told BFMTV that he saw a “man on the ground who is not moving.” Police swarmed the area and are circling the surroundings to make sure there are no accomplices. According to The Guardian, the French prosecutors office said that the counter-terrorism office is launching an investigation.

Three suicide bombers struck during a football match while gunmen carried out a mass shooting at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in the Bataclan theatre. 130 were killed, and more than 350 were injured. France has been on high alert since the January 2015 attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and a Jewish supermarket which killed 17. The incident at Notre Dame comes just three days after a terror attack in London, which ISIS has since claimed responsibility for. Police in the U.K. arrested 12 suspects in response to the attack, which claimed at least seven lives and injured more than 40 others on Saturday night. Major Terrorist Attacks in 2016 (Photos)

24,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/07/cities-again-face-threat-of-cuts-to-ant/,"LAS VEGAS -- Cities are pushing back on the possibility of losing millions of dollars in U.S. anti-terrorism grants under President Donald Trump's spending plan -- the third-straight White House that has moved to cut the funding. The proposed budget would cut cash for the program from $605 million to nearly $449 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and would require cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas to pay 25 percent of the grants. The administration said it is proposing the cost-share system, similar to other grant programs, to ""share accountability"" with states and cities. But lawmakers and local officials argue that reducing funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative would undercut efforts to maintain safe communities. Cities have spent the money on command centers, active-shooter training and personnel to patrol airports, transit hubs and waterways. [THE BUDGET: Interactive shows proposed changes to major agencies and how they compare to previous plans] Big cities have been down this road before, with funding fluctuating over the years. President George W. Bush created the grant program after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but he scaled it back in his second term. President Barack Obama's proposed fiscal 2017 budget suggested slashing the funding from $600 million to $330 million. In each instance, local politicians questioned the wisdom of taking away money in the fight against terrorism. This year, Congress ignored Obama's guidance and increased funding by $5 million. But some cities that have received grants in previous years have not spent all the money, another reason the White House says the changes are needed. [PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 100 days] The cuts were proposed a day after last month's deadly Manchester, England, concert bombing and the same day authorities in Las Vegas tried to ease concerns about the city being targeted in a recent Islamic State propaganda video. The footage encouraged knife and vehicle attacks and featured images of Sin City, Times Square in New York and banks in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement officials in Orlando, Fla., told a congressional committee last year, weeks after a nightclub became the site of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, that central Florida had missed out on needed training and opportunities to buy equipment because it had not made the list of cities to receive funding. Grants are awarded to the highest-ranked urban areas on a list determined by risk of terrorist threats based on past plots or a known presence; whether its infrastructure is a valuable target; and the consequence of an attack on the population, economy or national security. Last year, the 29 highest-ranked metro areas that applied for a grant received funding. The Las Vegas area has spent the money on training and equipment for bomb and hazardous-material squads along with computer software and hardware at a law enforcement command center. Las Vegas received almost $3 million in fiscal 2016. Irene Navis, planning coordinator and assistant emergency manager in Nevada's Clark County, said the area would be able to meet the proposed 25 percent cost-share requirement. ""Fortunately, not one agency is going to get the whole amount; it's split up,"" Navis said. ""So for one agency, it might be that they get $25,000 for equipment and the match is really small. Agencies that get a large amount of money, that's something that they would have to consider. But in general, in our urban area, it would not be a problem."" U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat whose district includes the Las Vegas Strip, called the funding change a ""pay-to-play scheme."" ""It is unimaginable that the administration believes southern Nevada's security will be improved by cutting vital programs that protect residents and travelers in our community,"" she said. But the administration questions why state and local governments aren't spending all the money if it's so important. ""The federal government cannot afford to over-invest in programs that state and local partners are slow to utilize when there are other pressing needs,"" according to a written justification from the Trump administration. The office of U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who has sparred with Obama and Trump on the grants, said that because of government procurement rules, it can take time for cities and states to spend the money. But he said that does not mean they have not allocated the money or don't need it. New York City received the largest grant last year at more than $178 million, followed by Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. ""America's cities are critical partners in the fight against terrorism -- and taking away this funding would undermine the national priority to secure the homeland,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Few details were available about the shooting in the 3300 block of West Douglas Boulevard about 3:15 a.m., where police canvassed a green space dividing the road. They laid down more than 30 evidence markers. One man waiting outside the hospital said his 17-year-old son was shot in the leg. Another man said a 24-year-old relative was undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to the side. Chicago police officers guarded three vehicles parked near the entrance, one with a bullet hole in the back window, apparently used by the victims to drive themselves to the hospital, according to preliminary information from a law enforcement source. The nine people injured in the Lawndale shooting were among 33 people shot from Saturday to Sunday morning, including two men shot on the Riverwalk near North Dearborn Street and West Wacker Drive in the Loop. All of the 9 people shot have had their conditions stabilized, according to police. Two 17-year-old boys, a 35-year-old man, a 29-year-old man, a 23-year-old man, a 30-year-old man were all taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. A 22-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were taken to Stroger Hospital and a 26-year-old man was taken to Rush Oak Park hospital. Of the shooting victims citywide, three men were killed. In the most recent homicide, 24-year-old Dontae Thomas, was shot in the abdomen in the Lawndale neighborhood just before 5:10 a.m. Sunday. Thomas was standing in the street in the 1400 block of South Avers Avenue when someone drove by in a white sedan and fired shots. Thomas, of the 3700 block of West Wrigthwood Avenue in Chicago, was taken to Stroger Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 a.m, according to the medical examiner's office. Just before 1:30 a.m., a 29-year-old man identified as Fredrick Vasquez was fatally shot in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, according to police and the medical examiner's office. Vasquez was standing on the sidewalk in the 1000 block of North Monticello Avenue when someone inside a gray sedan fired shots at him. Vasquez was taken to Norwegian American Hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest and pronounced dead at 2:04 a.m., according to police and the medical examiner's office. A 19-year-old man identified as Ivan Gutierrez, was pronounced dead on the scene after a drive-by shooting in Back of the Yards just before 3:15 a.m. Sunday, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office. Earlier, police said the dead man was 20. Gutierrez was standing in the street with two other people, who were also shot, in the 5300 block of South Seeley Avenue. A 33-year-old man was shot in the body and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where his condition was stabilized. A 22-year-old man was shot in the body and taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday for Gutierrez, who lived in the 5300 block of South Seeley Avenue, according to the medical examiner's office. Shooting on the Riverwalk A 30-year-old man and a 28-year-old man were shot on the Riverwalk just before 2:05 a.m. Sunday. The victims were arguing with other men when the situation escalated into gunfire, police said. The shooting appeared to be related to a fight about a woman, and ""not a random act,'' according to Chicago police. The older man was shot in the left foot and the younger in the right leg. Both men were taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized. A blood-soaked sock rested on the northeast corner of Dearborn Street and Wacker Drive inside yellow crime scene tape. Police closed the entrance from that corner to the Riverwalk and a portion of it underneath. Blood smears could be seen on the pavement below from the Dearborn Street Bridge. The Chicago police marine unit also responded to the Riverwalk, and a diver searched deep in the water. ""Did you see him throw a gun in there?"" an officer asked a man who said he heard the shots. The man said he did not because he was on the other side of the bridge. One of the men involved in the shooting ran into the Renaissance hotel, which is across the street on Wacker, according to preliminary information from a law enforcement source. Detectives continue to investigate and are making good progress reviewing surveillance video, police said.

32,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/11/services-mark-1-year-49-killed-orlando-gay-club/,"ORLANDO, Fla. — Church bells will toll throughout the Orlando area as residents reflect on the 49 patrons killed during a massacre at the gay nightclub Pulse in the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Starting in the early hours Monday, and continuing almost 24 hours later, survivors, victims' families, city officials and central Florida residents will remember the victims with four services. The first service is closed to the public, and it's being held at the nightclub for survivors, local officials and club employees. It will overlap with the exact time that gunman Omar Mateen began firing shots — a little after 2 a.m. on June 12, 2016. It is followed by another midday service at the nightclub, and an evening gathering in the heart of downtown Orlando. A final, music-filled late-night service is being held at the nightclub. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack and was eventually killed by police during a shootout after a three-hour standoff. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court, and she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband. On Monday, local churches throughout Orlando have arranged for church bells to ring simultaneously, 49 times at noon. Local officials also have declared the one-year mark as a day of ""love and kindness,"" and they are encouraging residents to volunteer or perform acts of compassion. An exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre will be shown at the Orange County History Center, and a giant rainbow, gay-pride flag will be unveiled at the Orange County government building. Not all the survivors planned to attend the events, saying it would be too difficult. ""There's going to be so many things going on that I feel it will be overwhelming for those affected,"" said Ricardo Negron, who managed to escape the club without physical harm after the shooting started. Demetrice Naulings said he would likely go to some of the commemorative events but he wasn't looking forward to it. Naulings also escaped from the club but lost his best friend, who was fatally shot. ""Seeing all of the other people from the club, I'm pretty sure the hugs will be teary. I'm not looking forward to that,"" Naulings said. ""I'm not looking for 'I'm sorry.' I feel like that doesn't help me. I feel like that is pity and I don't want pity."" Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

34,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/11/across-us-thousands-rallying-and-marching-lgbt-rig/,"WASHINGTON — In the nation's capital, and dozens of other cities across the U.S., supporters of LGBT rights mobilized for marches and rallies Sunday, celebrating their gains but angered over threats to those advances. The centerpiece event, the Equality March in Washington, was endorsed by virtually every major national advocacy group working on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Leaders of those groups have been embittered by several actions of President Donald Trump's administration — including the rollback of federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. The activists also complain that Trump, although he campaigned as a potential ally of gays and lesbians, has stocked his administration with many foes of LGBT-rights advances, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Throngs of marchers, many thousands strong, paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol, trailing behind a giant rainbow flag near the head of the procession. ""We're here, we're queer, get that Cheeto out of here,"" was among the chants directed at Trump. For the LGBT community nationwide, it's an emotional time. Monday is the anniversary of the mass shooting a year ago in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people — mostly Latinos — at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Among the marchers in Washington was Gil Mendez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled with his partner all the way from San Francisco to join the parade. He carried a sign that included the names of all the Pulse victims. ""The attack on Pulse really struck me hard,"" he said. ""It made the connection between the physical violence of guns and the political attacks on our community."" Also marching, and singing freedom songs and patriotic songs along the way, were scores of members of gay choruses from various cities. ""It's an opportunity to tell everyone we're still here, and we're not going away at all,"" said Gregory Elfers of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was with a contingent from the New York City Gay Men's Chorus. ""We have to be heard — we have to be sure we're not trampled on,"" said L. Owen Taggart of Washington's Gay Men's Chorus. Roughly 100 marches and rallies were planned across the U.S., from Portland, Maine, and Boston to Anchorage, Alaska, and Honolulu. More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out in Los Angeles where the annual Pride Parade was renamed the ResistMarch. Activists in Casper, Wyoming, planned that city's first-ever pride parade. Among the activist leaders on hand in Washington was Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, which monitors media coverage of the LGBT community. She noted that Trump, breaking from the practice of Barack Obama, has declined to issue a proclamation in honor of Pride Month, and that the Trump administration has deleted questions about sexual orientation from planned federal surveys. ""If you look at their prioritization, we're really low on it,"" she said. ""There absolutely is a resistance aspect to this march."" David Crary reported from New York.

Starting in the early hours Monday, and continuing almost 24 hours later, survivors, victims' families, city officials and central Florida residents will remember the victims with four services. The first service is closed to the public, and it's being held at the nightclub for survivors, local officials and club employees. It will overlap with the exact time that gunman Omar Mateen began firing shots — a little after 2 a.m. on June 12, 2016. It is followed by another midday service at the nightclub, and an evening gathering in the heart of downtown Orlando. A final, music-filled late-night service is being held at the nightclub. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack and was eventually killed by police during a shootout after a three-hour standoff. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court, and she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband. On Monday, local churches throughout Orlando have arranged for church bells to ring simultaneously, 49 times at noon. Local officials also have declared the one-year mark as a day of ""love and kindness,"" and they are encouraging residents to volunteer or perform acts of compassion. An exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre will be shown at the Orange County History Center, and a giant rainbow, gay-pride flag will be unveiled at the Orange County government building. Not all the survivors planned to attend the events, saying it would be too difficult. ""There's going to be so many things going on that I feel it will be overwhelming for those affected,"" said Ricardo Negron, who managed to escape the club without physical harm after the shooting started. Demetrice Naulings said he would likely go to some of the commemorative events but he wasn't looking forward to it. Naulings also escaped from the club but lost his best friend, who was fatally shot. ""Seeing all of the other people from the club, I'm pretty sure the hugs will be teary. I'm not looking forward to that,"" Naulings said. ""I'm not looking for 'I'm sorry.' I feel like that doesn't help me. I feel like that is pity and I don't want pity.""

It began at Grosse Pointe South High School to emphasize support for teens who are gay or transgender. Two 15-year-old marchers, Jessica Dodge and Shekinah Aho, held hands and wore shirts that said, “Make America Gay Again.” The Los Angeles pride parade was renamed the ResistMarch, and tens of thousands turned out in Hollywood, some carrying rainbow flags or signs reading “Love Trumps Hate.” Speakers included Mayor Eric Garcetti, U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, and RuPaul, the host of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Waters led the crowd in a chant of “Impeach 45.” “We’re going to take our country back from him,” she said. “I know that you have the strength. I know that you have the courage. And I know that each of you understand you have the power.” Back in Washington, the activist leaders on hand included Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, which monitors media coverage of the LGBT community.

A trio of events kicked off Pride month, including the second annual Golden Valley Pride Festival, a “queer prom” for adults and an Equality March at the Capitol in St. Paul, one of many local extensions of a large event in Washington, D.C. Attendees said the spirit of the events — which ranged from celebratory to somber — wasn’t dampened by the weather, but it did cause the Equality March for Unity and Pride in St. Paul to become a small umbrella-filled rally rather than a parade. In Golden Valley, the festival turnout was nearly double that of last year. More than 5,000 people filled Brookview Park to listen to bands, hang out in the beer garden and participate in a fun run organized by the Girl Scouts. “They came out in droves — Golden Valley really showed their resilience as well as their diversity,” said John Kluchka, the event’s co-chair. Nanette Stearns, who was there for Quatrefoil, the Minneapolis LGBT lending library, said, “I think we got a lot of non-GLBT folks to the event to show support.” Meanwhile in St. Paul, dozens of people took the weather in stride, joining about 100 cities across the country that held their own Equality Marches for Unity and Pride.

(Allison Carter/The TimesDaily via AP) “They were determined to have the rally no matter what,” said June Kuoch, who spoke at the Capitol. The larger theme of the national and international marches was to protest President Donald Trump’s agenda in hopes that it doesn’t erode recent progress on gay rights and marriage equality. But Kuoch said the mood in St. Paul was somber, especially during a tribute for the victims of the mass shooting at the gay Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Monday is the one-year anniversary of the tragedy that left 49 people dead. The night ended with the sixth annual Queer Prom, held in downtown Minneapolis at Hell’s Kitchen restaurant and bar. June is Pride Month across the country. The Twin Cities’ annual Pride festival and march take place June 24-25 at Loring Park.

LeBron James and Anthony Davis will do that for any team. But in a strange halted season, the Lakers withstood the disruption and persevered through the bubble to win the title. The Orlando Magic are in one of the more interesting and precarious spots in the entire NBA Draft. They hold two top 10 picks with the fifth and eighth selections. The 2020 season was a weird one for a lot of NBA franchises. The Orlando Magic are no exception. The season turned into a disaster, filled with injuries and the eventual trade of three franchise pillars for much o the last decade. The Orlando Magic have their coach. Jamahl Mosley was officially introduced as the team’s new head coach Monday. He spoke a bit about his overall philosophy both on the court and in developing players off the court. The Orlando Magic are the only team currently with two top-10 picks in this month’s NBA Draft, but that’s not the club’s only picks. The Magic are also selected to pick in the second round with the No. Now that the Orlando Magic have hired Jamahl Mosley as their head coach, we can now see what the foundation of the new Magic culture will be going forward. Green has been an assistant with the Suns for the past two seasons. He also spent 12 years as an NBA player. View the original article to see embedded media. The word family came up a lot during Jamahl Mosley’s introductory press conference on Monday. He talked about the atmosphere within the Orlando Magic organization as being that of the family. The Orlando Magic have found their coach in Jamahl Mosley. After a month-long search, the team found their coach to guide their rebuild. In Mosley, they found someone who has a strong player development background and a strong reputation for forging relationships with his players. To say the 2021 NBA Draft is a fairly important one for the Magic would be an understatement. After an injury-riddled campaign that saw the team post a 21-51 record and part ways with head coach Steve Clifford, the organization needs direction. Dallas Mavericks assistant Jamahl Mosley has agreed to a four-year deal to become the next head coach of the Orlando Magic. The Magic’s coaching search is over The Jamahl Mosley era is underway in Orlando. The longtime Dallas Mavericks assistant coach reportedly is being hired by the Orlando Magic to be the franchise’s next head coach. The 42-year-old Mosley has been an assistant with the Mavericks for the past seven seasons. View the original article to see embedded media.

The two sides are expected to finalize terms on Sunday as Mosley is traveling to meet with the team. The Orlando Magic are hiring Jamahl Mosley as their next head coach. Mavericks assistant Jamahl Mosley will be the new head coach of the Magic. The Magic are looking for a new coach after parting ways with Steve Clifford and might have one in Mosley. Woj reported that the Magic are “closing in” on the Mavs assistant coach The Orlando Magic’s coaching search could be nearing an end. The new frontrunner for the job is Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Jamahl Mosley, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski. Mosley appears to among the favorites to land the position. Unseld Jr. has interviewed with the team a second time. Michael Carter-Williams is widely known for earning the Rookie of the Year award with the Philadelphia 76ers during the process era. While Carter-Williams didn't become the star that people thought he would after his rookie season, there is no doubt that he had a long and successful career overall. With Hardaway a Magic legend in his own right, it’s unclear if he withdrew from the search or was informed by Orlando he was no longer under consideration. As the Portland Trail Blazers are left to deal with the fallout for their coaching hire, the Orlando Magic have apparently found their dream candidate to lead the locker room. Penny Hardaway has strong ties to Orlando, where he is a franchise icon after playing there between 1993-1999. There is history between Hardaway and the Magic that makes sense for him to be a candidate. He began his career with the Magic and developed into four-time All-Star in Orlando. Kidd is drawing interest from several teams with coaching vacancies. Penny Hardaway is expected to get offers to interview for head coaching opportunities around the NBA, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Teams are currently gathering intel on his work, as he is currently coaching collegiately for Memphis. As the Orlando Magic enter a rebuilding period, the franchise announced Saturday that they have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Steve Clifford.

Six people were killed and a dozen others, including Barber, were wounded in the Jan. 8, 2011, attack by Jared Lee Loughner. In 2013, the National Security Agency director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander, told Congress ""dozens"" of terrorism threats had been thwarted by the agency's surveillance methods, including collection of millions of domestic telephone records. In 2014, former President George H.W. Bush parachuted from a helicopter near his summer home at Kennebunkport, Maine on his 90th birthday. Bush jumped in tandem with Mike Elliott, a retired member of the Army's Golden Knights parachute team.

47,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/12/service-honor-pulse-massacre-victims/,"Trending: ORLANDO, Fla. — Scores of people gathered outside the perimeter of the Pulse nightclub Monday to pay their respects while inside the site’s fences, the names of the 49 victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history were read out loud in a private service. The early morning service was closed to the public and was held for survivors, victims’ families, club employees and local officials. It overlapped the time a year ago that gunman Omar Mateen started shooting inside the nightclub on “Latin Night” a little after 2 a.m. on June 12, 2016. “I realize that gathering here in this place, at this hour, is beyond difficult,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said during the service. “But I also know that the strength you’ve shown over the past year will carry you through today and in the future.” The private service was the start of what would be almost 24 hours of observations to remember the victims who died as well as the dozens of Pulse patrons who were wounded during the shooting. It would be followed by another midday service at the nightclub, an evening gathering in the heart of downtown Orlando and a final, music-filled late-night service at the nightclub. Outside the perimeter at Pulse, where the fence has been decorated with vibrantly-colored banners, people laid flowers and lit candles early Monday. Supporters dressed as angels stood guard outside the club before the service. Later in the day, church bells throughout the Orlando area were set to ring 49 times at noon. Gov. Rick Scott ordered U.S. flags around Florida to be flown at half-staff and a giant rainbow flag would be unveiled at the Orange County government building. Monday’s services culminated several days of events aimed at turning the grim anniversary into something positive. A foot race was held over the weekend, and eight gay and lesbian students were awarded $4,900 toward their college studies by a local businessman. Local officials have declared the one-year mark as a day of “love and kindness,” and they are encouraging residents to volunteer or perform acts of compassion. An exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre will be shown at the Orange County History Center. The club’s owner, Barbara Poma, is developing plans to build a memorial at the Pulse site. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack and was eventually killed by police during a shootout after a three-hour standoff. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court, and she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband.

It was Latin Night at the popular club. People were dancing, drinking, and having a good time. That was until about 2 AM, when Omar Mateen stormed the club and opened fire with an assault rifle, leaving 49 dead and another 53 injured. It was the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in US history. One year later, driving through Orlando, it's impossible to forget what happened that night, because the reminders are everywhere. Rainbow murals in tribute to the victims, posters in storefront windows proclaiming ""Orlando Strong"", and even rainbow welcome mats at local chain hotels, have transformed the face of the city into a living memorial to the massacre. Pulse remains closed, but you can visit the site. A fence surrounding the club is draped in black cloth that's been adorned with artwork. Wooden stars bearing the victims' names hang from a nearby tree, and rainbow teddy bears, statues of the Virgin Mary, and dried roses are scattered below a painted rainbow. At the back of the club, you see bullet holes through the fence—a reminder of the shootout between SWAT teams and Mateen, who declared his allegiance to the Islamic State terror group in a 911 call from inside the club. Mateen was killed. Continue reading on VICE News.

54,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-pulse-tragedy-and-the-ongoing-erasure-of-queer-latin-culture,"""I hate that there are practically no Latino gay clubs in Manhattan!"" I shouted, as a few of my buddies and I strolled toward one of our favorite gay bars in Hell's Kitchen. It was June 11, 2016, and we were out celebrating my Cuban-American friend Tony's 34th birthday. He furiously nodded in agreement to what, at that point, had become a common refrain from me, a border kid who grew up dancing to cumbias by artists like Selena and seriously missed the sounds of his childhood. Can a bitch get a timbale drum beat up in here without a 45 minute subway ride to Queens?! And I wasn't alone in feeling that. The other Latinx guys with us that summer night (some of Mexican descent, another hailing from Panama) echoed my frustrations, and each mentioned how they'd tried and failed to find a nearby Latin night so we could best express our unique sense of identity—an identity we felt was constantly overshadowed by the gay rights movement, which has been painted almost entirely white by both mainstream culture and the LGBTQ community at large. Now, don't get me wrong: in asking for a designated space just for LGBTQ Latinos, we've never wanted to segregate ourselves from our light-skinned queer brothers and sisters. There's a difference between honoring our heritage in a comfortable setting and refusing to coexist with those who don't share our racial or ethnic background. That's not the case here. We are all part of the same queer community, even if it's often depicted as looking one way more than another. But those observations didn't keep us off the dance floor that Saturday night, where we grooved alongside fellow Pride Month celebrators until 3 AM. I remember thinking on my way home that it was the kind of fun, invigorating experience that forces you to take a second and realize just how enjoyable it is to be out and proud. Then, a few hours later, I was awoken by a text message: ""This Orlando shooting is terrifying and sad."" Originally mistaking it for a separate incident involving former Voice contestant Christina Grimmie, I responded, ""Ughh with the young singer, I know!"" And that's when I started seeing the headlines on Twitter about a fatal attack inside a Florida nightclub called Pulse. Few news outlets I saw at the onset made note of the fact that it was a gay club, which angered me to no end. How could no one care to acknowledge that this massacre affected my community? Not only that, but it hit us at a place where we routinely find refuge from an exclusionary world. These crucial details needed mentioning, in my opinion, in order to avoid complete erasure from the media and those consuming it. A pit soon formed in my stomach with each new update. But it wasn't until I heard a CNN anchor declare that it happened to be ""Latin Night"" at Pulse that I felt nauseous, weak, and frankly, helpless. ""Wow, they really came for us,"" I remember thinking. ""This was a direct attack on my people: we were the targets."" Yes, we. Looking back at the victims list and scanning through their pictures, how could I not take it personally? A vast majority of those killed had names that sounded like mine, faces that looked like mine, skin tones that matched mine, and likely struggles that resembled mine, as a South Texas native forced to hide his truth from those who thought homosexuality was a sin reserved for jotos y maricones. Those proud Latinos gunned down that morning presumably sought out the exact same music I've longed to move my hips to. The truth is that these queer, brown victims lived (and died) as their authentic selves, and this queer, brown man couldn't help but feel deeply affected by their loss. I reverted back to that moment from the night before with my compadres, where we lamented the lack of venues (and by extension, events) created specifically with us in mind. Had they existed, we would've been there, cha-cha'ing it up with like-minded folks. And had Orlando been New York City, it could've been us; we could've been the casualties in America's deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman. The only thing that saved us was a ZIP code. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and even to this day, it was impossible for me, and other LGBTQ Latinos, to not play the ""what if"" game; to not consider placing ourselves in that very situation, since it was entirely plausible. And, honestly, who could blame us? Well, apparently, some could. I had several gay acquaintances, who happen to be white, ask why I felt as affected by the tragedy as I did. I recall one brunch that summer, when a white ""friend"" I hadn't spoken to in several weeks tried to assert ownership over the table's grief. When I, the only Latino at the table, calmly challenged him, he essentially asked: what made it so different for you? That harsh line of questioning—from fellow queer people, no less—not only angered me, it made me cognizant of the growing divide that exists between LGBTQ Latinos (and queer people of color in general) and our white counterparts. Because it seems the latter just don't get it, particularly after Orlando. The fact remains that our LGBTQ community has a tendency to consistently showcase white members over others. It allows them to showcase their opinions first and assigns them a greater weight. Their stories and success have somehow become the default for our community. And it too often feels like the existence of LGBTQ Latinos are rarely included in America's queer narrative, because society has always chosen to elevate voices that don't quite know how to roll their Rs just yet. Visibility is key, and it hurts knowing that the only time I've really seen myself as a gay, brown individual is in watching Pulse's coverage. White LGBTQ people aren't neglected; their faces never not seen. They know representation well, while we're here trying to find someone who reflects our experiences on a larger cultural scale. Don't believe me? Name more than seven prominent, out Latinos. Go ahead, I'll wait. Ricky Martin? Cool. Wilson Cruz? Got it… next? And Cruz himself, who lost a close family member during the shooting, agreed that people needed to be more respectful of the victims' ancestry. ""Not only is this a story about a minority group being attacked, but it's a minority within a minority that was attacked,"" the actor and activist told the Huffington Post shortly after the shooting. Noting that he, too, felt the presence of cultural erasure, the Puerto Rican star added, ""Let's not whitewash their experience; it's multi-faceted."" Former Orlando resident Sergio Lugo felt similarly. A work acquaintance introduced me to Lugo late last week both because of his connection to the region and his own visceral reaction to Pulse as a bisexual Afro-Latino. Lugo told me that, while at a local cafe, he overheard a Bible study leader characterize the victims not as gay or Puerto Rican but as human. He wrote to me and said, ""Rhetoric like [that] seems nice in theory, implying that we're all equal under God's eyes, but I couldn't help but perceive it as a lecture in erasure."" Rudy Campos is a close hometown friend of mine who was out clubbing in Austin, Texas, on June 11th. He wrote me, saying, ""It makes me really sad that as a Latino and as a gay man, I have a huge target on my back."" He also expressed discomfort with knowing that, in addition to perceived religious persecution, he's seen as ""less valuable than a Caucasian man."" ""My feelings are basically: why don't I feel safe being myself?"" Campos said. And it's a valid question, considering how tough it is growing up, and ultimately existing, as someone who is gay and brown. For instance, there's the weight of machismo, or overt masculinity, that dictates our early behaviors and mannerisms; there's the pressures of a religion, usually either Catholicism or Christianity, that shames you for your same-sex attractions; there's the lack of representation on all fronts that makes you feel worthless and invisible; and there's the persistent fetishization of Latinx people, particularly gay men, by those enchanted by our ""exoticism."" As difficult as this queer brown life can be sometimes, especially post-Pulse, it's mine—it's ours. We have the privilege to enjoy it, and I, personally, am more determined than ever before to do just that. Not everyone receives that blessing, and I don't take my fortune lightly; not when 49 people were senselessly deprived of their own. So in the words of the Queen of Salsa, Celia Cruz, in her iconic Carnaval hit, we must know that ""la vida es una hermosura, hay que vivirla""—life is beautiful, we must live it.

56,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/358704776/0/phoenix/nation~One-year-later-Orlando-remembers-victims-of-Pulse-massacre/,"ORLANDO — After his daughter Jahqui’s startling, hysterical late-night phone call, off-duty Orlando firefighter Benigno Sevilla rushed to Pulse to rescue her on June 12, 2016. Jahqui Sevilla had been visiting the popular gay nightclub with two friends — who were both wounded by gunfire during the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. They dove for cover behind a couch during gunman Omar Mateen’s chaotic rampage: “She was watching him walking around shooting people, and she was having bullet casings rolling into her face,” Benigno Sevilla described. Monday, Sevilla and hundreds of mourners, journalists and spectators converged on the former South Orange Avenue nightclub — which has evolved into a makeshift memorial — to honor the victims and salute the survivors. Some survivors are still not ready to return to Pulse, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said.Across the 0.3-acre property, people cried, embraced and shared memories. Hundreds of colorful candles, flower bouquets, framed photos, flags, balloons and personalized momentos decorated the shrine-like site.An emotional midday vigil in the Pulse parking lot featured speakers and the Orlando Gay Chorus. Seven rows of seven white heart-shaped flower wreaths hung on the south side of the building, each bearing a victim’s name. Photos: Pulse nightclub as one year anniversary approaches “One year ago, 49 beautiful, innocent lives were forever stolen from us, and countless others forever changed at this place. This tragedy was so jarring because this is not the Orlando we all know — a vibrant city that prides itself in its love, inclusion and hospitality,” said U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Winter Park.“From the courageous police officers and first responders, to compassionate medical professionals, and complete strangers, Orlando came together as one city. Ordinary citizens did extraordinary things,” Murphy said. Torres: Pulse one year later U.S. Rep. Val Demings, D-Orlando, told the crowd that “hate walked onto this property” one year ago.Comfort dogs were deployed at Pulse to comfort distressed loved ones, and the Mental Health Association of Central Florida dispatched more than 10 volunteer counselors from 7 a.m. to midnight. Benigno Sevilla recalled that Jahqui endured problems sleeping in the dark, dealing with loud noises, and going out in public in the months after the massacre. “We are looking after the first responders, the survivors, the friends and family, the members of the LGBT community, and the Latinx community. No questions asked, we provide counseling to them,” said Mary Magee, MHACF social media assistant, standing on the sidewalk outside Pulse.“Everyone is just kind of coming together and supporting each other, you know? There is a lot positivity and people uplifting each other today,” Magee said. Thousands of people braved rainfall Monday night to attend an ""Orlando Love: Remembering Our Angels"" event featuring music, speeches and a candle-lighting ceremony at Lake Eola Park. Speaking from the amphitheater stage, Dyer said the legacy of the Pulse massacre should be a living ideal, rather than a date on a calendar. “I believe that the story of the Pulse shootings is not a story about a vicious act of hatred and terror by a deranged killer. I believe it’s a story about the triumph of a community. The triumph of courage over fear,” Dyer said, drawing applause. Sisaundra Lewis, who reached the semifinals on Season 6 of NBC’s “The Voice,” sang and dedicated her song “Applause Applause” to Pulse patrons. And Olga Tañón, a Grammy Award-winning Puerto Rican pop singer, performed “Hallelujah” alongside a ballroom dance troupe. “I miss Pulse. I miss what it stood for, who we served, and how many people we helped,"" Pulse owner Barbara Poma told the crowd. ""My heart is shattered by this hateful act against our community. And we’ve had to suffer through such trauma.""Less than 2 miles north of Pulse, a curated One Orlando Collection of several hundred Pulse-related artifacts opened Monday morning at the Orange County Regional History Center. The exhibit is open free to the public through Saturday.Artifacts were collected last year from Pulse memorials that sprang up at the nightclub, Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, Orlando Regional Medical Center and Lake Eola Park. The exhibit showcases photos of similar memorials that occurred in Berlin, Germany; Sydney, Australia; Moscow, Russia; Tel Aviv, Israel; and other worldwide cities.Museum officials opened the exhibit to victims’ relatives during a private Sunday night viewing.“It’s an opportunity to revisit the pain. But what we hope is to give a sense of the uplifting that the community was there to give people who lost friends, relatives, sons and daughters,” said Mike Perkins, executive director and museum manager.“I think it speaks to people, and I think it will more in future years,” Perkins said of the collection. Contact Neale at 321-242-3638, rneale@floridatoday.com or follow @RickNeale1 on Twitter Eau Gallie vigil set for Saturday Speak Out Brevard and Space Coast Pride will co-host a “United We Stand For Love” vigil from 7 to 9 p.m. Saturday at Eau Gallie Square. in remembrance of the one-year anniversary of the Pulse nightclub tragedy.

The trailer for Kelly’s interview with InfoWar’s Alex Jones hit on Sunday night, and despite the fact that she seems to take him to task over his damaging conspiracy theories, many are finding the fact that she’s giving him such a mainstream platform very troubling. One of Jones’ particularly toxic pet theories — that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the parents faked the deaths of their own children — has made many speak out against the interview, including Nelba Márquez-Greene, whose daughter was killed in the mass shooting. It's a miracle no #sandyhook parent has ended their life yet. The loss of a loved one and the constant harrasment is too much. @megynkelly — Nelba Márquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017  Here you go @megynkelly – her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene.

Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz — Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017  As for Jones, he went on a bizarre, angry rant before the promo even aired, calling Kelly “Not feminine. Cold. Robotic. Dead.” shortly after they conducted the interview. Now, in a new video from InfoWars, he wants the interview pulled completely. In a rambling live stream, Jones claims that the interview is a “hit piece trying to destroy independent media.” Jones also claimed that the preview was edited in such a way that made it look like he was doubling down on his Sandy Hook claims. However, his biggest beef seems to oddly be with the fact that the interview will be airing on Father’s Day. “I clicked this morning and went ‘That’s Father’s Day.’ They want to sit there with fathers and families together — and they know I’m a father and the whole piece is about how I’m a father — and it all clicked: make fathers look bad.” Jones goes on to rant about how the editing and lighting were just a ploy to make him — “a guy that looks like a classic American father” — to make him look menacing. NBC may have back themselves into the corner with this one. If they cancel the interview, Jones will most likely count this as a victory against the mainstream media. However, if they go forward with their plans, they’re just giving more credence to an organization that is becoming a truly damaging force in the political landscape.",2017-06-12 19:37:15,"Alex Jones Went On A Long Rant About His Megyn Kelly Interview, Asking That It Not Be Aired On Father’s Day",,68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

60,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/13/fierce-kingdom-gin-phillips-review,"Last modified on Wed 21 Mar 2018 23.51 GMT Joan is at the zoo with her four-year-old son, Lincoln. It’s close to closing time and they are in the Dinosaur Discovery Pit, Lincoln playing a game with his superhero toys, when she hears a series of loud cracks. “She tries to imagine what anyone could be doing in a zoo that would sound like small explosions... they could not have been gunshots.” But as Joan and Lincoln meander towards the exit, she sees bodies, and a man with a gun. They’re in the middle of a mass shooting. Joan picks up Lincoln and runs. Fierce Kingdom is the Alabama writer Gin Phillips’s fifth novel, her imagining of how a mother would react in this blackest of nightmares. It is panic-inducingly gripping as Joan dashes in her flip-flops for a hiding place while negotiating the questions and concerns of a four-year-old. “She can imagine clamping a hand over his mouth, holding him tight, ordering him to be perfectly still and perfectly quiet. She desperately wants that, but she cannot imagine a scenario where it is possible. If she scared him badly enough for him to stop talking, he would probably start sobbing.”  They hide in an empty animal enclosure, Joan texting her terrified husband, who has just realised where his wife and son are. She feels they’re as hidden as they can be. “Put your arms around me,” she whispers to Lincoln. “Close your eyes and disappear.” But time passes, the sun begins to set, and Lincoln starts to get hungry. This is the sort of book that, by virtue of its horrific premise, is impossible to put down until its resolution. And beware, there is a scene that is really too disturbing to read: not for its goriness – Phillips doesn’t do gore – but for its sheer awfulness. It is also – and this was unexpected, in such a page-turning, adrenaline-soaked read – an eloquent and meditative insight into motherhood and what it means, its many small trials and joys and wonders. Lincoln, thinks Joan, as she tries desperately to keep him quiet, “is packed to the brim with sound and movement, and one or the other is always spilling over the edges, and that is normally not a bad thing but now it makes her terror bubble to the surface”. With deft, careful memories and observations, Phillips brings this ordinary – and wonderful in his ordinariness – four-year-old to life. “There was the time when he looked up at her in a hotel lobby and announced, I have two little girls in my pocket. Tiny girls. One is named Lucy and one is named Fireman. There was the time when he told her that all his stuffed animals went to a church where no one wore pants.” I’ve read two thrillers in recent months that I have adored – for their freshness and for the way they forced me to read them in a scarily obsessive fashion until I’d finished them. The first was Erica Ferencik’s The River at Night, in which four friends struggle to survive in the Maine wilderness after a white-water rafting accident. This is the second. Both are miles away from the prowling menace of domestic noir, or the carefully constructed mysteries of police procedurals. Here the challenge is pure survival, and it’s one hell of a ride watching these characters try to make it. Fierce Kingdom by Gin Phillips is published by Doubleday (£12.99).

62,http://www.startribune.com/nation/428204813.html,"Megyn Kelly’s NBC interview with Infowars’ Alex Jones is not scheduled to air until Sunday, but it’s already caused intense controversy. Jones, whom the Washington Post has described as a “conspiracy-spewing” radio host, has long dismissed a gunman’s shooting rampage that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. The gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Adam Lanza of Newtown, also killed his mother and himself. Jones has called that massacre a government hoax. His critics say that by inviting him on “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” Kelly was legitimizing his views. Some personally affected by the Sandy Hook shooting decried both Kelly and NBC. Now, several organizations appear to be following suit. Kelly will no longer host the Promise Champions Gala, an annual event for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group founded by family members of some of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, the organization announced late Monday. The event is scheduled to be held Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director of the organization, said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.”

                                            Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist host of Infowars.com, is pictured in his Austin, Texas, control room, Feb. 17, 2017. Families of some of the 26 people who were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre have criticized an upcoming Megyn Kelly interview with Alex Jones, who has said the shooting was a hoax perpetrated by forces hostile to the Second Amendment. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that JPMorgan Chase pulled its local television and digital ads from all NBC News programming until after Sunday’s interview airs. A company spokeswoman declined the Post’s request for comment on the report. Earlier Monday, the company’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted, “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?” Even Jones publicly questioned the interview. “I’m calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook,” he tweeted Monday afternoon, along with a 41-minute YouTube video. “Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here, and she said the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there,” he said in the video, adding that he believes children died during the shooting but that he wanted to play “devil’s advocate” since his listeners expressed doubt. “My listeners questioned it. … I played devil’s advocate by saying maybe none of it happened and it was all fake,” Jones said in the video. “The other side of me believes those parents I’ve seen on TV, and real mass shootings happen, so it probably did happen.” Kelly defended her decision on Twitter, stating it was important for her to “shine a light” on Jones, given that he remains relatively unknown even though President Donald Trump has both appeared on Jones’s show and complimented the controversial radio host. She also pointed out that Infowars, Jones’ organization, was given a temporary press credential last month. “Many don’t know him; our job is 2 shine a light,” Kelly tweeted. © 2021 StarTribune.

63,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/cq-Ai_d3YCs/,"Despite all the criticism, it appears NBC still plans to air an interview between its newest star, Megyn Kelly, and InfoWars host Alex Jones. Kelly's sit-down with Jones was announced Sunday night, and some on social media immediately showed their concern. Jones, who's a conspiracy theorist, has called the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School a hoax. And NBC's preview of the interview touched on that. ""Well, Sandy Hook is complex because I've had debates where devil's advocates said the whole story is true, and I've had debates where I've said none of it is true,"" Jones said. Kelly defended the interview Sunday, tweeting that President Donald Trump has praised the radio host's show and that it was her job to ""shine a light"" on Jones. But on Monday, J.P. Morgan Chase temporarily pulled its local TV and digital ads from all NBC news programming until after the interview airs. Kelly was dropped as the host for an upcoming Sandy Hook benefit. And even Jones called for Kelly not to air their interview, claiming his views were misrepresented.

Fire up Google and type in the words “Is it normal to want to…” Surprised that the first or second result is typically “kill?” Want more? Type in the full phrase “Is it normal to want to kill,” and consider that the most common words that follow it are not strangers like “the guy who cut me off in traffic,” but “my boyfriend,” “my brother, “my family,” and “my ex.” Welcome to the secret side of Homo sapiens mind. None of us would admit contemplating the possibility of whacking a loved one, but none of us would admit, say, how little sex we have either. And yet the truth is out there. Consider that heterosexual women report, on average, that they have sex 55 times per year and use a condom 16% of the time. That comes out to 1.1 billion condoms. When heterosexual men are asked the same questions about sexual frequency and condom use, however, the total comes out to 1.6 billion condoms. Someone’s clearly not telling the truth—and as it turns out, no one is. Only 600 million condoms are sold in the U.S. per year. Everybody lies — about sex, racism, the way we vote, the things we read, even the way we feel about our children. That makes it a very good time for the straightforwardly titled book Everybody Lies, by big-data expert and pundit Seth Stephens-Davidovitch. It also makes it a good time for the more practical Truth at Work, by Mark Murphy — founder and CEO of the professional training service Leadership IQ — which smartly explains how both bosses and employees can battle the fibbing pandemic, making the workplace, at least, a little more honest. Of the two books, it is Everybody Lies that’s likely to make you squirm most, because at least somewhere in its pages, you’re certain to get busted for your own dishonesty. You pride yourself on raising your son and your daughter absolutely equally, banishing all gender stereotypes from your household? Maybe. But somebody’s responsible for the fact that searches for “Is my son gifted?” significantly exceed ones that ask the same question about daughters, while parents ask “Is my daughter overweight?” twice as much as they ask if their son is. Similarly, we all claim to keep our news sources high-brow, and the fact is, there are 27 Facebook likes about stories in The Atlantic for every one about stories in the National Enquirer. But the two publications have roughly equal circulations and score roughly equally in Google searches. Clearly, there are plenty of people who are entirely happy to leap on a story about Elvis’s remains washing up on an island next to Amelia Earhart’s, even if they’d never think of sharing it. If big data can serve as a mild corrective for our elitist airs or our unexamined gender biases, that’s a good thing. It’s the darker and less tractable matters that data-mining turns up that should leave us all unsettled. Consider that after the 2015 mass-shooting in San Bernardino, which was committed by two ISIS sympathizers, the most frequent Google search in California that included the word “muslims” was “kill Muslims.” Consider that searches that include the n-word spike whenever African-Americans are in the news — the first time President Obama was elected, every Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, even during the coverage of Hurricane Katrina, whose hardest-hit victims were African Americans. Truth at Work takes on the problem of dishonesty in a decidedly less sweeping way, but it’s one that has everyday relevance for nearly anyone. We are all familiar with bosses who blithely overestimate their understanding of a new product or an old problem — and have no apparent desire to learn; with employees who perpetually deny or reject any criticism; with coworkers who treat every request as a demand, every bit of advice as a hurtful slight. Murphy prescribes what he calls “Truth Talks” to address these problems and—no surprise perhaps, since this is a business advice book —they have three elements: truth talks must be based in fact, must be designed to create change and should be dialogues, not diatribes. The book is filled with such white-board wisdom: the Four Truth Killers (confident awareness, perpetual resistance, psychological resistance, financial resistance); the SCOUT approach (be Specific, Candid, Objective, Unemotional and Timely), and so on. All the same, it’s hard to read the book without experiencing some of the same discomfiting recognition Everybody Lies elicits — recalling the last time you either exhibited some of the bad behavior Murphy describes, or at least reacted to it poorly when it was aimed your way. And Murphy is right that in most situations, a little truth-telling, even if it’s a hard truth you tell yourself, can help a lot. Nobody pretends we’re living in honest times. It was a dozen years ago that Stephen Colbert, in his faux bloviator role, coined the term “truthiness,” and we could all still laugh at the casual dissembling of too many of America’s leaders. Now, in the era of “alternative facts” and a President who howls “Fake news!” at stories that may be uncomfortable but are very much real news, the laughter is strained. A cold slap of regular truth-telling would do us all some good.

Later, someone is hurt while expressing concern for one of the shooting victims. The horrible spectacle unfolds over six minutes of video.

Roger Williams (R-Tex.) and two Capitol Police officers. The shooter has been identified as James T.

Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society,” the former Democratic presidential nominee said. Democrats and Republicans were preparing to face off for a charity baseball game when the shooting began. Democrats, practicing on a different field, bowed their heads in prayer for their Republican colleagues. In defiance of the violence, Democrats and Republicans plan to play the charity game as scheduled on Thursday. They will meet at Nationals Park.

The park was occupied by approximately 20-25 Republican congressmen who were practicing for an upcoming baseball game before their workday began. The Congressional Baseball Game is held annually and pits Democrats and Republicans against each other in a non-partisan, fun environment. Eyewitness video has since come in documenting the moment the first rounds were fired. You may watch those videos below. When news broke about the shooting, very little details were revealed. As the day progressed, the names of the shooter and the Congressional Representatives who were struck were revealed. Victims wounded during the Congressional mass shooting are as follows, according to the Washington Post.Steve Scalise House Majority WhipDavid Bailey U.S. Capitol PoliceCrystal Griner U.S. Capitol PoliceZach Barth a staffer for Representative Roger WilliamsMatt Mika Tyson Foods lobbyistAll five were transported to nearby hospitals for treatment. The President was first to reveal that the anti-Trump gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, was shot and later died at the hospital. The F.B.I. later confirmed Hodgkinson's death. He was 66-years-old and hailed from Illinois. The investigation is ongoing and as we learn more about the gunman, information will be updated. Hodgkinson had used social media networks to share his hatred for President Trump and Republican members of Congress. He had supported Bernie Sander's run for the presidential office and had made earlier online threats towards President Trump. Bernie Sanders condemned Hodgkinson's actions and other lawmakers used the despicable act to plead for citizens to return to a state where people no longer treat each other with vitriol and hate. Secret Service reported that Hodgkinson was not on their radar. The news has sparked debate over how much attention should be given to online threats, especially death threats towards President Trump. By 8:30 a.m. ET, Democratic and Republican leaders began using social media networks to address the shooting incident and try to calm constituents' fears. Very little information was available and many just asked people to pray for those involved, while also revealing their horror, shock, and disgust. Early reports correctly identified Majority Whip Steve Scalise as being severely injured in the shooting. As further reports came in, it was learned Scalise had been shot in the hip. He underwent surgery and is currently listed in critical condition. According to NBC News, a man who was later identified as James T. Hodgkinson approached Representatives Ron DeSantis (R-Fl) and Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) and asked whether the Congressmen practicing on the field were Democrats or Republicans. Both men had left Eugene Park before the shooting occurred, but quickly realized they had spoken with the gunman as reports surfaced. They have given their statements to police. Exactly how many rounds of gunfire were exchanged is unknown and the investigation remains open. A nearby YMCA was struck by bullets terrifying those in the immediate vicinity. Nearby schools were immediately put on lockdown.Active shooter situation during this mornings trip to the Y. Terrifying. Am ok.

That's the question that haunted countless minds around the nation's capital as news of a mass shooting on a baseball diamond in Alexandria, Va., spread across town. That's a sign of how desensitized we Americans have become to mass violence. But this tragedy also was different. It involved Congress. A gunman, identified by law enforcement as James T. Hodgkinson, wounded five people when he opened fire at a park where Republican members of Congress were holding a morning baseball practice. The wounded included House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, as well as a congressional staffer, a lobbyist and two Capitol Police officers from the congressman's security detail. ""There are very strong emotions throughout this House today,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Wednesday, frequently pausing as he spoke on the House floor. As with the shooting in 2011 of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, this new violence hit Congress on a noticeably personal level. This time, the impact was further heightened by the symbolism of the occasion. At a time of infamously high partisanship in Congress, the annual baseball game is a rare time in Washington's political culture of relaxed tensions and unified purpose — usually. Ryan, a close colleague of Scalise, pushed back against that depressing development, turning his reaction to the shooting into an uncommonly eloquent and defiant call for unity and perseverance. ""We are all giving our thoughts to those currently being treated for their injuries,"" he said. ""And we are united. We are united in our shock. We are united in our anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us!"" That simple declaration — ""An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us"" — triggered a standing ovation and sustained applause, punctuated by scattered cheers, that reminded me of the last time I heard it spoken in Congress, after Giffords was shot. Giffords is an Arizona Democrat. Scalise is a Louisiana Republican. But Ryan spoke to a shared identity and sense of purpose that, when we hear our better angels, crosses party lines. ""My colleagues ... there are so many memories from this day that we will want to forget … and there are so many images that we will not want to see again,"" he said. ""But there is one image in particular that this House should keep. And that is a photo I saw this morning of our Democratic colleagues, gathered in prayer this morning after hearing the news."" He compared the daily debates, deals and disputes of Congress to a big test, a struggle of rational thought against raw emotions. ""At times our emotions clearly can get the best of us,"" he said. ""We're all imperfect. But we do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber."" He even went so far as to use a metaphor that you don't hear spoken very often about Congress: a family. ""For all the noise and all the fury, we are one family,"" he said. ""These were our brothers and sisters in the line of fire."" Unfortunately, in this age of gridlocked agendas and factional fighting across — and with — party lines, Congress has been a dysfunctional family at best. The ""baseball shooting,"" as headline writers are calling it, reminds us of how much our lawmakers, who know how to play together, need to show us that they can work together.

The Washington, D.C. area and political junkies around the country were left in a state of shock Wednesday, in the wake of the horrific attack on Congressional Republicans at a baseball field. As would be expected, the shooting dominated the evening broadcasts of the Big Three Networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC). But in a pleasant twist, all three avoided pushing the liberal talking points for gun-control, while at the same time, welcoming President Trump’s unifying address. In fact, the only time gun control was brought up was on NBC Nightly News when White House Correspondent Kristen Welker reminded viewers of when former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot 2011. “The last time a member of Congress was shot, six years ago, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords targeted while meeting constituents in her Arizona district,” Welker reported. “Giffords has become a proponent of tougher gun laws.”  Welker even read part of a statement from Giffords and it didn’t mention gun-control. “Today saying: ‘It don’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican… This shooting is an attack on all who serve…’” Welker repeated. And surprisingly, Welker appeared to throw Virginia’s Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe under the bus for daring to bring up gun-control during a press conference earlier in the day. “And today, others renewing that call,” she said before playing a clip of McAuliffe. “It's another flash point in American politics with clear dividing lines, but today those fractures: forgotten,” she then quipped. In the clip, McAuliffe stated that “this is not what today is about, but there are too many guns on the street.” The clip omitted the part where he made the outrageous and ridiculous claim that 93 million Americans were killed by guns per day. The population of the United States is over 320 million people. That means, according to McAuliffe’s stat, almost 30 percent of the U.S. population dies every day because of guns. That’s a pretty good reason for the networks to avoid the subject. But we’ll see how long the peace lasts. Transcript below: NBC Nightly News

The last time a member of Congress was shot, six years ago, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords targeted while meeting constituents in her Arizona district.

The game has been played annually for over 100 years and C-Span will live stream the event. Check your local cable listings to watch the Congressional Baseball Game on television. You can watch C-Span live online via YouTube and through their official channels C-Span 1, C-Span 2, and C-Span 3 that are available through their website. The first pitch is thrown at 7:05 p.m. ET, and the Congressional Baseball Game takes place at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The decision comes after a mass shooting took place at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park as members of the GOP were practicing for tonight's game. Five people were shot and wounded including two Capitol police members and Majority Whip Steve Scalise. The victims are Representative Steve Scalise, Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, lobbyist Matt Mika, and staffer Zach Barth. Congress united after the horrific attack and asked the nation to set aside their political differences and come together as one. Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan addressed Congress and the nation following the attack. The Congressional Baseball Game supports a number of charities including the Boys and Girls Club, National Dream Foundation, and the Washington Literacy Center. After the mass shooting, the Congressional Baseball Game announced they had added the Capitol Police Memorial Fund to their list of charities. The gunman was later identified as James T. Hodgkinson's and authorities continue to investigate the shooting as well as the perpetrator's motivation. The shooter died at the hospital. The shooting will not deter the Congressional Baseball Game for Charity that is one of the few times Congress puts aside their political differences, unites in fun and sport and works together for a good cause. Senate and House members have participated in the Congressional Baseball Games since 1909. Are you going to watch the Congressional Baseball Game tonight?

76,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/yJ3iingDW-g/,"The same day two mass shootings — one just outside of Washington D.C. at the GOP Congressional baseball team’s practice session, the other at a UPS facility in San Francisco — occurred, NBC made a slight adjustment to its evening schedule. That’s because “Shoot-Up-Able,” the fourth episode in the critically acclaimed The Carmichael Show‘s third season, featured a mass shooting. According to Entertainment Weekly, the network had not yet decided when (or if) it would reschedule the episode, which further encouraged show creator and star Jerrod Carmichael to speak out during an appearance on Chelsea. “I thought that [the] episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way. You know, really lend itself to conversation,” Carmichael told host Chelsea Handler. “A lot of times when things like this happen, and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say, ‘Too soon!’ But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately these things happen constantly, and it’s a thing that breaks all of our hearts.” As Uproxx‘s Alan Sepinwall noted in his review of the first five episodes (including “Shoot-Up-Able”), “[t]here’s something about the collision of loud sitcom punchlines with incredibly difficult topics that’s made Carmichael Show one of TV’s best and most unexpected comedies.” And judging by Carmichael’s description of the episode plot to Handler, it seems his series’ take on mass shootings could have offered American TV viewers a thought-provoking antidote at just the right time: “The episode itself was about me, the character of Jerrod, surviving a mass shooting and him coming to the realization that, although he wasn’t physically harmed, he is still very much so a victim. We all are victims when something like this happens. We realize that we all suffer from fear — fear of going out, fear of enjoying your life — and we all suffer from the pain of knowing that families have lost loved ones. That’s what the episode is about.” As for NBC’s decision to pull “Shoot-Up-Able” regardless of the episode’s finer points, Carmichael admitted he “understands a corporation making that decision.” However, this didn’t stop him from suggesting NBC was essentially saying “[they] don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue, and something that reflects real family conversations, and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims.” Doing so, he concluded, is a “disservice” to those who make the show, those who watch it, and pretty much everyone else in the country who needs to have this conversation (and others like it) right now.

77,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/15/colorado-republican-fundraising-email-congressional-baseball-shooting/,"Trending: The top Republican in the Colorado House of Representatives is drawing national criticism after he referenced Wednesday’s shooting of U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise in an email that solicited political donations. In the email, sent by the conservative Colorado Liberty PAC and signed by Minority Leader Patrick Neville, the Castle Rock lawmaker said he laid the blame for the shooting “squarely at the feet of ‘tolerance-preaching progressives’ and their accomplices in the media who allowed violent rhetoric to get so out of control.” He went on to ask recipients for a $25 or $50 donation to “show us that you’re not backing down … so we can retake the state House in 2018.” Though it follows a format commonly used in political fundraising pitches, Neville in an interview with The Denver Post disputed the idea that it was a fundraising email, saying that just two sentences of the email referenced campaign donations. “The closing pitch of the email was to get back to civil discourse,” he said. “Sometimes passionate discourse, but it should be civil.” The email was initially made public by Daily Beast contributor Dave Maney, then published by Colorado Pols, a local liberal blog, before being picked up by national outlets such as the New York Daily News and Raw Story.

78,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/why-the-pulled-mass-shooting-episode-of-the-carmichael-show-is-still-vital,"Early on in its first season, The Carmichael Show quickly garnered a reputation for focusing episodes on ""hot-button"" issues. It's a sitcom in the vein of Norman Lear: finding an important and much-debated topic and then distilling it down to 22-minute sitcom fare, all while in front of a roaring studio audience. Through gallows humor, The Carmichael Show can find laughs in everything from police brutality to Bill Cosby. The episodes aren't really meant to provide answers, but to pose questions that allow the characters—and by extension, the viewers—to bring up multiple viewpoints. Some we agree with, some we don't. You're supposed to be entertained for the duration of the show, and you're supposed to spend some time thinking about it afterward. Now in its third season, The Carmichael Show has kept this up: it covered rape in its season premiere and assisted death just last week. The episode that was supposed to air last night was ""Shoot-Up-Able"" one set during the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting. In response to yesterday's multiple shootings, NBC pulled the episode—airing, instead next week's ""Lesbian Wedding""—and has not yet said when, or if, the episode will air. Temporarily pulling episodes in the wake of tragedies is general practice. In 2013, after the Boston bombing, episodes of Hannibal, Castle, and even a scheduled repeat of New Girl were pulled; in 2015, the season finale of Mr. Robot was postponed after the murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward; last year, TNT pulled the season premiere of The Last Ship because a fictionalized nightclub murder resembled that morning's Pulse shooting. These are understandable decisions as the episodes often depicted violence that was eerily similar to the real-life events, often featuring triggering images. The Carmichael Show's ""Shoot-Up-Able"" is different. The episode, which I watched a screener of last month, doesn't depict violence. There's never an image of anyone wielding a gun. It's about the aftermath, the trauma, the way people talk about violence, and the way they come together and help each other after violence occurs. In an appearance on Chelsea, Jerrod Carmichael discussed why he disagreed with NBC, explaining that the decision says, ""You don't think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims."" (His full appearance on the episode will air on Netflix on Friday.) The comment about the episode respecting the victims is key, because it's exactly what ""Shoot-Up-Able"" does: it finds a smart, affecting way to talk about the victims of mass shooting through Jerrod, who narrowly escapes becoming one himself. It doesn't, like many of the understandably-pulled episodes, gleefully focus on the criminal and their violence, and it doesn't sensationalize a murderous event for shock value and entertainment. Instead, it's quiet, introspective, and ultimately warm (and yes, riotously funny at points). It's driven by the characters, and it examines the slow-effects of trauma—this is what we need from television. The episode also—even just based on the title!—discusses the all-too-common occurrences of these shootings. A place that is ""shoot-up-able,"" according to Jerrod, is a crowded place with little security: malls, concerts, train stations. The characters chat about this as if it's second nature, because it almost is second nature at this point. What the episode wants is for us to talk about why this feels so normal, what effects it has on us as people who witness this violence day after day, and what we can do to fix it. But we can't do that if the episode doesn't air. (It's also worth nothing that The Carmichael Show already tackled guns once before, in its first season.) After a shooting, there are inevitably people—often pro-gun advocates—who will chastise anyone calling for change by explaining, ""Now is not the time to discuss gun control."" It's a way to keep putting off a necessary discussion by never actually talking about it. NBC's decision to pull ""Shoot-Up-Able"" is annoyingly reminiscent of this train of thought because it silences the conversation. It's one thing to pull an episode that glamorizes violence but it's another to pull an episode that both uses truth and humor to comfort those who are hurting while also jumpstarting a national discussion. As Carmichael said, this ""does a disservice to all of us."" Follow Pilot Viruet on Twitter.

Major League Baseball's annual trade deadline is sooner than usual. It was moved up by one day on the calendar to avoid possible conflict with afternoon games on Saturday, July 31, where teams might be put in situations where they might have to play short-handed or risk injury to players. At 35-55, the Texas Rangers are on their way to their fifth straight losing season, the longest streak since the franchise moved to Texas in 1972. The Rangers are, however, in a rebuild, so it wasn't necessarily unexpected to finish near the bottom of the standings. In watching Rangers baseball the past week, you may realize everyone now calls Nate Lowe, Nathaniel Lowe. Chuck Morgan is doing it. Graphics have changed. On this date in Texas Rangers history, Hank Blalock made his impact on Rangers All-Star Game history and tied a Hall of Famer in the process. On July 15, 2003, Blalock appeared in the All-Star Game alongside former Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez. As is often the case for the Bronx Bombers, they could be looking for some left-handed hitting help ahead of the trade deadline. Enter Texas Rangers outfielder and two-time All-Star Joey Gallo. Before you express a pure sense of negativity, remember the initial question, “What’s the goal of 2021?” The Rangers wanted to develop their youth within the organization while getting some of their young big leaguers experience. Adolis Garcia on Tuesday became the fourth Texas player to hit a double in an All-Star Game and he and Rangers teammates Joey Gallo and Kyle Gibson were on the winning side in the American League’s 5-2 win over the National League at Coors Field in Denver. Joey Gallo, who makes his second All-Star Game appearance on Tuesday night, has been a fan favorite almost since arriving in Arlington. His defense has improved dramatically throughout his time in the big leagues. Adolis García making the All-Star Game would’ve been inconceivable three months ago. The Texas Rangers wrapped up the third and final day of the 2021 MLB Draft with their final 10 selections. Just one of the 10 selections ranked in MLB.com's Top 250 prospects. On this date in Texas Rangers history, Roger Pavlik did something no Rangers pitcher had ever done before. On July 13, 1996, Pavlik and the Rangers were at Oakland and had just wrapped up the All-Star Break. Day two of the 2021 MLB Draft is all wrapped up.

Vanderbilt ace Jack Leiter parlayed his breakout college season into being the No. 2 overall pick to the Texas Rangers in the 2021 Major League Baseball draft... With the second overall pick in the 2021 MLB Draft, the Texas Rangers selected RHP Jack Leiter out of Vanderbilt University. Leiter, 21, went 11-4 with a 2.13 ERA over 18 starts, averaging 14.6 strikeouts per nine innings with a 0.85 WHIP in his sophomore season. The Vanderbilt righty was ranked No. 2 on CBS Sports' pre-draft top 50 In a draft that never had a definitive number one pick, and saw a surprise at the top, the Texas Rangers might have walked away as the real winners. With the selection of Vanderbilt’s Jack Leiter- arguably the biggest name in the 2021 class- GM Jon Daniels, scout Kip Fagg and co. The Rangers placed King on the 10-day injured list retroactive to Wednesday and ahead of Friday's game against the Oakland Athletics with left shoulder inflammation. The All-Star right fielder has 23 home runs this season. Calhoun is under club control through the 2024 season. Rangers left fielder/DH Willie Calhoun fractured his forearm after being hit by a Kris Bubic pitch during Saturday's game against the Royals.

Businesses participating in the new Safe Place program will be identified by a sticker in their window. Anyone who is a target of hate speech or violence is welcome to take shelter in a Safe Place business and wait for police, said Lt. Michael Wyatt, the department’s new LGBTQ liaison. Wyatt brought the Safe Place program to Denver after visiting the Seattle Police Department, where it was created by Officer Jim Ritter. Wyatt said he hears stories about gay, lesbian and transgender people being harassed in the city but the number of reports made to police do not match the number of stories shared. “This is wrong,” he said. “These crimes are historically underreported. If we don’t know they’re occurring, there is nothing we can do to prevent them.” Last year, 11 of the 34 bias-motivated crimes reported to Denver police involved anti-LGBTQ actions, according to police crime data. As of May 31, seven anti-LGBTQ crimes have been reported this year. Wyatt hopes more people will feel comfortable reporting hate crimes to police, knowing that someone is concerned and dedicated to taking action. Even if someone reporting a crime doesn’t give their name, police will have a record of where the incident happened and know where to focus resources, he said. The announcement about the department’s new outreach toward the GLBTQ community coincides with Pride Week 2017. Denver PrideFest will be celebrated Saturday and Sunday in Civic Center.

Jones has questioned whether the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting actually occurred. On Dec. 14, 2012, Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 7, as well as six adult staff members at the Newtown, Connecticut, campus.

Police said the man killed was Alexander Hayes, 39. The name of the 43-year-old suspect is not being released pending a review of the case by the district attorney’s office. Police said the two men knew each other and  lived across the street from one another in the 7700 block of MacArthur Boulevard. The stabbing was reported about 12:10 a.m. Friday. Police said the men had gotten into a fight a few minutes earlier in the 2700 block of 78th Avenue. Other people broke up the fight but the suspect then left and came back with a knife and stabbed Hayes multiple times, Sgt. Omar Daza-Quiroz said. Hayes was able to stagger back toward where he lived on MacArthur Boulevard before collapsing. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The suspect remained at the scene and was arrested, police said. The knife was also recovered. Daza-Quiroz said police are still trying to determine what prompted the fight.

86,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/jun/17/911-memorial-designer-create-church-shooting-memor/,"CHARLESTON, S.C. — The architect who designed the 9/11 Memorial in New York has been chosen to create a memorial to honor the nine worshippers gunned down in a racist shooting attack on a South Carolina church. The decision came Saturday on the second anniversary of the massacre at Emanuel AME church in Charleston — a day also marked by a crowd singing ""Amazing Grace"" as they marched to the church. Emanuel's bells rang nine times at the end of the ""Hate Won't Win Unity Walk."" Last year, friends and family dedicated 15 trees on Emanuel's front lawn — one for each of the dead, the five people inside the church who survived the slaughter and one for the church's congregation. This year, plaques were placed under each tree. The white killer of the nine black worshippers is in a federal prison in Indiana after a federal jury found him guilty of hate crimes. Those 12 jurors told Dylann Roof in January he would pay with his life for the mass shooting. Roof is appealing that death sentence. More memorials are planned at the Charleston church. A prayer garden is under construction, and Michael Arad will soon begin work on the memorial that the Rev. Eric Manning, pastor of Emanuel AME, said will be a reminder of the resiliency of the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. One of the church's founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to lead a slave revolt in 1822. He was put to death and the church was burned down and closed for decades. ""If we are able to shine a light on the beauty, resiliency and love that was shown by members of this congregation and the community of Charleston, we will succeed in showing the best of humankind in the wake of the worst,"" Arad said. Emanuel AME itself is adjusting too. The church fellowship hall where Roof sat through 45 minutes of a Wednesday night Bible study before firing the first of 77 bullets as the worshippers bowed their heads for a final prayer on June 17, 2015, has termites and unpatched bullet holes, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. Some members want to totally renovate the hall because the wood-paneled walls and round white tables are a reminder of the massacre. Others, including the pastor, want it restored to look the same. No decision has been made yet. Manning, who came to Emanuel last summer, has made some changes. The Wednesday night Bible study is now held upstairs in the church sanctuary to spare members from reliving the horror every week. Dozens of visitors still come to Sunday services at Emanuel AME. The church used to welcome and individually recognize each visitor between hymns and the sermon. But after the shootings, that stretched on for so long it seemed to overshadow Manning's message from the pulpit. So now visitors are welcomed as a group with a brief word from the pastor toward the start of the service. Members then greet them with a short song: ""Emanuel, God is with us. Emanuel, in Him do we trust. We welcome you to this holy place. We welcome you with our warm embrace. We welcome you, we welcome you to Emanuel."" ""I did not want worship service to continue to be a spectator sport,"" Manning told the newspaper. ""Some people may not agree with me, and I understand that. But my job is to protect worship.""

(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for EJAF) Caitlyn Jenner on Friday made an ill-timed joke about Wednesday’s mass shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, that injured four people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. “Fortunately the guy was a really bad shot,” the former Olympian said of the gunman at a College Republican National Committee convention. “Liberals can’t even shoot straight.” The College Republican event wasn’t open to the press, but the Q&A session with Jenner was recorded as a Facebook Live event by the College Republican Federation Of Virginia. Also Read: Bernie Sanders' Wife Blames Media in Wake of Alexandria Shooting (Video) Also Read: Bernie Sanders' Wife Blames Media in Wake of Alexandria Shooting (Video) “Nobody deserves what happened out there. There’s no justification,” Jenner, a longtime Republican, said of the attack. Gunman James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old Illinois man who worked as a volunteer for the Bernie Sanders campaign and expressed anti-Trump views, was killed by Capitol police during the attack. “There are crazy people,” Jenner continued. “We have to minimize that type of stuff.

During the discussion of the attack, Jenner praised her service, but downplayed the relevance of her membership in the LGBT community to the situation. “As far as the Capitol police officer, first of all, she did her job,” Jenner continued. “She wasn’t thinking about LGBT issues, she wasn’t thinking about any of those types of things. She did her job and she did it well.” Watch the whole video below (Jenner’s remarks on the Alexandria shooting begin about two minutes in).    Caitlyn Jenner at #CRNC2017 Gala!

""S-Town""It doesn't seem that John B. McLemore was particularly private about his sexuality, having apparently spoken to reporter and ""S-Town"" host Brian Reed about being ""a semi-practicing homosexual"" openly and on the record. But for some reason, Reed chose to keep that fact from listeners until episode 3, framing it as a surprise. The show's sixth episode is devoted entirely to McLemore's past romantic and sexual partners, going into such detail about the private life of a dead man it almost feels invasive. Reed justifies this by saying that ""trying to understand another person is a worthwhile thing to do,"" but if it's so crucial, why was it hidden from the narrative until after McLemore's death?

90,http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/-N0kcxOs4Ek/,"The Megyn Kelly interview with controversial Infowars founder/host Alex Jones won't air on Connecticut television. Tonight's interview on Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly sparked outrage because Jones previously claimed that the horrific December 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a false flag operation. Jones has stressed that he no longer holds that belief. Claiming that his views were misrepresented in the interview, Jones previously released a 30-minute video (see below) containing a pre-interview telephone conversation with Kelly as well as snippets of the interview itself. On the phone, Kelly seems to be engaging in some serious flattery in trying to get Alex Jones to agree to the sit-down at his base in Austin, Texas, claiming that she finds him ""fascinating,"" and promising that she would never do a ""gotcha interview"" or a ""hit piece."" According to Jones, however, Kelly was very combative in person, and the interview turned out to be an interrogation or cross-examination by the network correspondent he referred to as a ""modern-day Medusa"" and corporate puppet. She took a lot of things out of context and repeatedly hammered him about Sandy Hook, Jones insisted about the interview that Infowars recorded in its entirety and is holding the footage in reserve. At one point in the conversation, Kelly oddly referred to herself as a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry the Cable Guy. She also seemed to throw some shade on the cable news industry as compared to NBC News' alleged higher standards. In the meantime, at least one advertiser has dropped out of sponsoring the broadcast, the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation booted Megyn Kelly from hosting its annual gala, and some outraged Sandy Hook families have reportedly threatened legal action if the interview airs. Perhaps as a form of damage control, Kelly issued a lengthy statement sent out on her Twitter feed describing Jones' Sandy Hook hoax claim as ""personally revolting."" Jones himself has called for the interview to be shelved in the video below.According to the New York Post, Megyn Kelly and her team are substantially re-editing the interview so that she appears to get tougher with the gravelly voiced Infowars conspiracy theorist and to include interviews with at least one Sandy Hook family. Several Sandy Hooks families have apparently turned down the offer to appear with Megyn Kelly, however. ""[NBC News Chairman Andrew] Lack, who made a big splash by hiring Kelly, is under pressure now over the messy handling of the Jones interview which has become a public relations nightmare for NBCUniversal and parent company Comcast,"" FoxNews.com explained. Against this backdrop, Connecticut Hartford/New Haven NBC affiliate WVIT-TV won't broadcast Megyn Kelly's show tonight, pursuant to a memo apparently from the station's general manager obtained by TV Newser.""...Over the last few days, we have listened intently to Sandy Hook parents, our viewers and importantly, to you. We have considered the deep emotions from the wounds of that day that have yet to heal. Because those wounds are understandably still so raw, we have decided not to air this week's episode of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly...""

It's unclear if going forward with the Alex Jones interview is a desperate ratings grab for NBC News.Some media industry observers have expressed uncertainty, in general, as to whether Megyn Kelly will thrive in the new time slots -- which includes a Monday through Friday 9 a.m. program -- and wonder, in particular, if her talents will seamlessly transform to more lifestyle- and celebrity-driven content. Kelly was also subject to some degree of criticism for the way she handled a recent interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

94,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/18/megyn-kelly-infowars-alex-jones/,"Trending: By Hillel Italie, The Associated Press NEW YORK — Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones hemmed and hawed when pressed repeatedly by Megyn Kelly to admit he was wrong to call the massacre at Newtown, Connecticut a hoax. Jones never gave a direct answer in a segment Sunday night on NBC’s “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” Kelly has been criticized intensely for giving a platform to Jones, who has also called the Sept. 11 attacks an inside job. She has defended her decision by noting that President Donald Trump has praised Jones and appeared on his radio program. The “Infowars” host said at one point that he was playing “devil’s advocate” in denying the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But he continued to express doubts, saying that he had “watched the footage” of children leaving the building that it “looks like a drill.” “Some of it looks like it’s real but then what do you do when they’ve got the kids going circles in and out of the building with their hands up. I’ve watched the footage,” he said. “That looks like a drill.” The segment with Jones combined Kelly’s interview with background on his history of false remarks, his relationship with Trump and comments from Newtown parent Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in the shooting. When Kelly asked him whether he had anything to say to Jones for Father’s Day, he responded, “I think he’s blessed to have his children to spend the day with, to speak to. I don’t have that.” Last week, Jones leaked an audio recording of what he said was a phone conversation with Kelly, heard promising she would not portray him as “some kind of boogeyman.” Shortly before Sunday’s night interview, Jones released a Father’s Day video in which he offered condolences to families who had lost children in the “horrible tragedy” of Newtown, but did not refer to his previous comments disputing the killings. “Parents should never have to bury their own children,” Jones said. Connecticut’s NBC affiliate said Friday it wouldn’t air the report. In an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, NBC Connecticut staff members were told station executives made the decision after listening to concerns from employees, Sandy Hook families and viewers and considering “the deep emotions from the wounds of that day that have yet to heal.” Lawyers who represent 12 people who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook urged NBC News officials not to air the interview. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told the AP that the Jones story would be edited with its critics in mind. The interview also was seen as a test of the interviewing skills of Kelly, the former Fox News star whose questions two weeks ago for Vladimir Putin were widely panned for being too easy on the Russian leader. An unaired segment obtained by Huffington Post showed Kelly telling him that “virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia.” Kelly challenged Jones from the start, introducing him as a “radical conspiracy theorist” and promising to confront him on his “notorious lie” about Sandy Hook. The two frequently interrupted each other as Kelly kept asking if he would admit to his wrongdoing and a visibly tense Jones kept deflecting her questions, blaming the media for distorting his remarks or veering between acknowledging and disputing the tragedy. “I will sit here and look at every position and play devil’s advocate,” he said. Jones also downplayed his connection to Trump, who at times seemed to use conspiracies aired on Infowars in his campaign speeches. “I think my influence on Trump is way, way lower than what MSM (mainstream media) has said,” he commented, saying he and the president were “friendly,” but not friends. NBC signed Kelly to a multimillion dollar contract earlier this year. Her star power had grown after she challenged Trump during a 2015 Republican debate on his history of sexist remarks and the candidate responded with a series of angry tweets and other comments, sometimes crude and personal, and boycotted a later debate because she was one of the moderators. She then was a key figure in the downfall of former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, telling in-house investigators of inappropriate conduct by Ailes that supported Gretchen Carlson and other women who had made similar accusations. Kelly wrote of her battles with Trump and Ailes in her best-selling memoir from 2016, “Settle for More.” Kelly’s old employer needled her over the weekend, sending a tweet headlined “Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones: NBC News under fire for ‘botched’ rollout.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2017-06-18 21:04:49,Megyn Kelly presses “Infowars” host Alex Jones on Sandy Hook denial,,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

97,http://www.nationalmemo.com/public-pressure-forced-megyn-kelly-expose-alex-jones/,"Reprinted with permission from MediaMatters.  A well-deserved firestorm of denunciations from the families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting and other critics forced Megyn Kelly to turn a report that was originally billed as a self-promotional head-to-head showdown with Alex Jones into a well-edited investigation of the dangers posed by an unstable megalomaniac with millions of loyal fans, including one in the Oval Office. But Kelly deserves little credit — she acted in response to overwhelming public pressure, and the network’s impotent reaction to Jones’ own grabs for media attention may allow the nation’s biggest producer of conspiracy theory media to come out the winner of tonight’s program. At no point since Kelly teased her interview with Jones at the end of last week’s show has she or NBC been able to control the narrative spinning out of her own show. It’s a shocking failure for one of the media’ssavviest manipulators of her own image, and the network that hired her. Immediately after last week’s Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, Sandy Hook family members began speaking out. They said they had suffered years of torment and harassment due to Jones’ claims that the shooting was a “hoax,” and denounced Kelly for granting him a platform. Desperate to salvage the situation as brutal headlines rolled in, NBC all but promised its critics that the segment would be edited to portray Jones as negatively as possible. That’s exactly what happened. The segment benefited from devoting very little time to Kelly’s interview with Jones, minimizing his opportunity to appeal to her audience. Instead, through strong voiceover, clips from Jones’ program featuring the host spouting conspiracies, and interviews with a conservative commentator who opposes Jones’ influence and the father of a child who died at Sandy Hook, Kelly explained how Jones operates, the harassment his targets experience, and his close ties to President Donald Trump. The segment reportedly went through drastic changes following the spate of condemnation, with NBC adding an interview with a Sandy Hook family member and slicing and dicing the footage of Kelly’s sit-down with Jones to make it more damaging to him. It’s not unusual for networks to edit stories right up until airtime. But last week’s public relations nightmare clearly played a role in the segment NBC ended up running. NBC deserved that nightmare. Kelly was hired to be a new face of the network and given a program aimed to challenge CBS’ 60 Minutes for newsmagazine primacy. But after the first episodes of her newsmagazine show suffered from poor ratings and reviews criticizing her interviewing skill, NBC took a chance with a Jones sit-down, which offered Kelly the opportunity to reset the show’s reputation with a viral moment. That the network’s executives apparently didn’t realize that news of the segment would trigger a backlash from Jones’ victims shows a tremendous lack of foresight and ignorance of the subject matter. NBC paid for that failure with a series of awful news cycles pitting their new star against traumatized families who had lost their children who castigated Kelly for giving Jones a platform. I believe Jones is a newsworthy subject for national news outlets. It is important for the American people to learn how the nation’s most prominent conspiracy theorist has garnered a large audience and gained the ear of Trump (the circumstances were different earlier in the decade, when Media Matters criticized severalnetworks for giving him a platform). But as I argued last week, interviewing Jones’ victims would be more likely to shed light on his character than Kelly’s initial approach of focusing on a head-to-head showdown. The week of controversy drastically changed NBC’s calculus, producing a significantly better segment than suggested by last Sunday’s preview. It’s too early to tell whether the Sandy Hook families who criticized the decision to interview Jones will be satisfied with the result, or if they will deal another blow to Kelly’s stature. But while Jones isn’t having a meltdown, he can’t feel good about the segment’s clear implication that he is a dangerous extremist. And given how badly the radio host beat the network’s PR team this week, they may have something to fear from him as well. Kelly and her network were caught flat-footed, unable to either anticipate or successfully react as Jones repeatedly outmaneuvered them, taking control of the narrative and successfully framing the story for the national media through the propagandistic manipulations that make him such a dangerous force. Jones “has learned how to program the mainstream news by inciting outrage online that is then discussed and covered by mainstream media,” BuzzFeed’s Charlie Warzel reported after Jones released embarrassing audio of phone calls in which Kelly tries to talk him into doing the interview. “But Kelly and NBC were ill-equipped to deal with the pro-Trump media apparatus. Instead, they adhered to the traditional rules of a big television interview that assume a good-faith relationship between interviewer and interviewee.” Jones escalated his public relations offensive as the interview approached, releasing a Father’s Day video in which he offered “sincere condolences” to the Sandy Hook families, lied about his previous comments about the attack, and lashed out at NBC. Jones was live on the air before Kelly’s show aired, spreading rumors about Kelly and threatening to release his own recording of their interview if he was displeased with the result. After it aired, seeking to bolster the image that he won the night, he and his cronies drank a champagne toast on camera. As Jones again tried to take over the story online, the NBC News and Megyn Kelly twitter feeds went dark, ceding him the social space.  The radio host wanted more attention, and he got it, seeking to build his audience by portraying himself as the mainstream media’s victim. Thanks to Kelly’s failure to control her own narrative, he may well succeed. Kelly’s segment demonstrates that, with enough pressure, broadcast outlets can produce adequate reports on the pro-Trump fringe. But the last week shows they still haven’t learned enough to effectively defend their work against an alternative media assault. And it remains to be seen whether NBC’s failure to control the narrative around Jones’ interview helped him more than an otherwise competent segment hurt him.  Know first. The opinions that matter.

98,http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/student_code_of_conduct_modifi.html,"Summer break is just getting started for many Michigan children, but state officials are already prepping for a big shift scheduled to take effect in August to the state's school discipline law. The Michigan Department of Education has revised its model code of student conduct to reflect a new law attempting to reduce suspensions and expulsions by softening the state's zero-tolerance policies. Signed by Gov. Rick Snyder in late 2016, the law ends mandatory suspensions and expulsions for offenses such as assault and bringing a weapon to school, and requires administrators to consider factors such as a student's age and disciplinary history when deciding whether to punish a student. State Superintendent Brian Whiston says the new law is a welcome change, because it provides districts with flexibility when making disciplinary decisions. ""I was forced sometimes, I felt, under the law to expel some students that I felt probably shouldn't have been expelled,"" said Whiston, who formerly served as superintendent of Dearborn Public Schools. ""There was no intent to do harm, but because they fit the zero-tolerance, I think it put us in a box where if we didn't do it we were in jeopardy."" The code of conduct is a tool to help school officials understand and navigate the rules surrounding student discipline. The revised code is open to public comment through July 14. It will go before the state board for final approval at its Aug. 8 meeting. During a recent State Board of Education meeting, board member Michelle Fecteau asked what steps the department is taking to oversee whether districts are following the new law, and what consequences are in place for those that aren't doing so. Kyle Guerrant, a deputy superintendent at MDE, said the legislation did not give his department - or any other entity - authority to provide oversight on the implementation of the new law. Rather, he said, it's up to parents to raise concerns with their local school board or other entities if they feel their child has been disciplined in a way that's inconsistent with the new approach. Michigan's zero-tolerance law was passed in the wake of the 1999 Columbine High School mass shooting. The new law takes effect on Aug. 1. Lori Clark, superintendent of the Newaygo County Regional Education Service Agency, said local schools in her area are working to fine-tune their policies and be ready to comply with the law when students return to school this fall. ""The local flexibility is good, because it looks a little different everywhere you go,"" Clark said, referring to how schools handle matters of school discipline. ""It looks different in East Grand Rapids than in Grand Rapids."" Grand Rapids Public Schools spokesman John Helmholdt said his district is ""ahead of the curve"" in reducing suspensions. His district has been working on the matter since 2013 after the district was flagged by the state for suspending a ""disproportionate number of suspensions for African-American males."" GRPS has sought to do so through a method known as ""restorative practices,"" which can include having two students involved in a dispute meet with one another - in a supervised environment - to deescalate a conflict before it becomes dangerous or violent. ""We had students who were just constantly bickering and we went through the restorative practices and they are now best friends,"" Helmholdt said. Under the law, a student who brings a gun to school would still be permanently expelled, ""unless the student can establish mitigating factors by clear and convincing evidence,"" according to an analysis of the law by the nonpartisan House Fiscal Agency.

Each year since then, individuals who identify as LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) and their allies organize events that promote visibility and demand equality throughout the month. However, in those 17 years, the amount of hate crimes against LGBT individuals — the most targeted minority group in the country — hasn't budged much. More: Let's talk about sex: LGBTQ topics no longer banned The deadliest mass shooting in the nation's history was the attack on Pulse Nightclub in Orlando last year, killing 49 and leaving another 53 wounded. Earlier this month, a 12-year-old member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — Utah's overwhelmingly predominant religion — was silenced by ecclesiastical leadership in front of her congregation while she bore her testimony and came out as a lesbian in a video that quickly went viral. According to River Beatty's obituary, a 22-year-old Southern Utahn who committed suicide in May, she was transitioning from male to female and was ""antagonized"" throughout her life because she struggled with her gender identity. One 15-year-old Californian in the LDS faith was sent to St. George in 2011 by her parents who believed her homosexuality could be cured with treatment. Alex Cooper, coauthor of ""Saving Alex,"" was subjected to emotional and physical abuse at an unlicensed treatment center run by fellow Mormons who ""used faith to punish and terrorize her."" She was subjected to emotional and physical abuse, including being forced to face a wall while wearing a backpack full of rocks for extended periods of time. These few of many examples show just how dangerous it is, still, to identify as LGBT in the United States, not only because hate crimes and speech are rampant, but also because LGBT individuals are often a danger to even themselves. More: So. Utah transgender community fearful of future LGB youth are more than twice as likely to attempt to kill themselves than their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control, while youth who identify as transgender are 8 times more likely to attempt suicide with parent rejection. More surprising is the ""exceptionally high prevalence"" of lifetime suicide attempts of LGBT youth across all demographics, according to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. Members of the Southern Utah LGBT community report facing issue after issue, but perhaps the most important question is: Are we willing to lose our children over this? _________________________________________________________ John Meisner, of Southern Utah University's Allies on Campus group, was raised in a conservative, Fundamental Baptist home during the notorious AIDS crisis in the 80s. It was a tumultuous time in American history, and it was a time during which Meisner said he felt terrified, especially knowing that he was gay. He heard both subtle and explicit messages that LGBT individuals were ""horrible, evil, possessed and pedophiles."" ""It's just a bewildering experience,"" Meisner said. ""Personally, the way I think I survived was creating an alternate identity. I doubt that's unusual."" But Meisner didn't come out until 2012, and he had reached what he described as his midlife crisis. Meisner's midlife crisis wasn't just an issue of self-confidence that could be fixed with a new car or an odd-ball hobby: Meisner began planning his suicide. ""Once the hope of getting 'fixed' was gone, it got really bad,"" Meisner said. ""There used to be hope that someday God would save me, and I just had to wait for that miraculous day to arrive. Once I realized that day was never coming, I knew there was no way out."" It was when Meisner realized he wasn't getting fixed because he wasn't broken that he fully accepted his authentic self, to which he gives much credit to his friends and colleagues, but he valued the acceptance from his children and ex-wife the most. ""If there was very much negative stuff said about me (when I came out), I don't know of  it,"" he said. He's since developed a sense of ""extreme urgency"" to do more to unveil facts about LGBT youth suicides, specifically finding statistics that better reflect the Southern Utah community — which Meisner said he believes the rates are ""catastrophic."" Meisner's story is not unique, and for Hunter Schone, a Southern Utah native, his experiences with shame and isolation were similar. More: DSU's new LGBTQ-plus Resource Center opens doors Schone, who grew up in Utah and recently moved to London to work on a graduate degree in neuroscience, came out to his parents when he was 16 years old. Schone's family lived in St. George at the time, and they remain an example of a strong LDS family in the community. Schone said he grappled with knowing he was breaking the expectations his family had of him while also trying to live a life true to his identity. What people didn't see past Schone's apparent charming, comfortable life was that it was in fact a living hell, he said. It's a phenomenon Schone says he encounters with every LGBT person he's met who grew up in the LDS faith: These youth go through an internal dichotomy that creates a whole slew of psychological issues. ""They have this really real love for the church and experiences they have in that, but at the same time, there's something so real about being gay and identifying as gay or lesbian that brings so much happiness in their lives,"" Schone said. Schone did not date until years after he came out to his parents, and he said he felt shameful about it. He was attending Brigham Young University as an undergrad when he went on what he considers his first real date. Later, while still attending BYU, he came out to his roommates with whom he shared an apartment in BYU-approved student housing. At first, Schone said his roommates displayed acceptance and support, but they later filed a complaint with the university's honor code office and had Schone evicted with no notice. ""They provided textual evidence that I was in a gay relationship,"" Schone said. ""My roommates had texts from our group of me basically saying I was with my boyfriend at certain times that we were dating."" True to his intelligent, disciplined nature in his education and title of ""Most Likely to be President"" he garnered in high school, Schone worked tirelessly for 20 months on original academic research that was soon to be published. But while Schone's honor code violation was being investigated, he was quickly informed that his research contract with the university was terminated indefinitely. The published research, of which he was encouraged he'd be named an author of, only listed Schone as a contributor in the end. More: Understanding what's killing our youth: Suicide in So. Utah schools ""The honor code office intervened into discussions about the investigation with my research supervisor, without my approval, which made things obscenely difficult and awkward, and it ultimately destroyed my two-year relationship with my research supervisor,"" Schone said. Schone was permanently suspended from the university. ""In the church, there's this surface-level message of love, but there's also this subliminal message of homophobia,"" he said. Suicide crossed Schone's mind frequently following the incident at BYU. To him, it seemed like a sound, logical decision rather than an emotional one. ""To live a life that was gay was worse than killing myself,"" Schone said. ""I thought it would be better for me to kill myself rather than come out to my family, tell them I'm gay, and live a life contrary to what God wanted me to live."" Schone said he guesses there are thousands of LGBT youth in the LDS faith who are trying to be good Christians, and yet he said their church doesn't always do enough to take care of them. ""Mormon legislators aren't going to put an investigation on why we're losing all these kids,"" he said. ""They're not willing to do that and lead it back to the church they go to every Sunday.""  Meisner explained how many youth in Utah feel, which is that they'll never live up to the expectations of their parents, religion and communities. ""I was told explicitly just last week, 'You need to live a celibate, solo life,'"" Meisner said. ""I didn't grow up Mormon, but the expectations are exactly the same thing."" It's not uncommon for families to avoid the topic altogether, and sometimes, Meisner said, the families have to ""come out"" as well in the wake of a child's death via suicide. ""They're placed in an awkward situation of coming out on behalf of the dead child as well as coming out as a family,"" Meisner said. ""When you throw in all the stigma on top of it, which is probably why the person committed suicide in the first place, now the family is dealing with that stigma as well."" More: Utah's suicide epidemic: The tip of the iceberg  ""My concern is how we accidentally and inadvertently traumatize and victimize our own children,"" he added. ""What parents don't realize is that we are talking about their own children. When we're talking about a family and their kids, I feel like that supersedes politics and religion. We forget we're really talking about our own kids."" Mike Carr, the homeless student liaison at Washington County School District, said he doesn't know exactly how many homeless LGBT students he oversees, but he knows they exist. Most have been ostracized and later kicked out of their homes by their parents. Part of the problem, though, is their existence is known only if the student comes forward — which can be frightening, he said. ""It's a combination of the students both not wanting people to know they're homeless and not wanting anyone to know they're LGBT,"" Carr said. Ultimately, the message of real, unconditional love is what's missing in so many youthful LGBT lives. Meisner said the message of ""I love you no matter what,"" is essential in any household, and he said it seems like the most powerful thing in the world to him. ""I need you to love the LGBT youth,"" Schone added. ""I need someone to love them and tell them they're enough because that was something no one ever gave me. Spending so many years of people telling me I was not enough, to me, pride is the community and the world telling me that I am.""

101,http://www.denverpost.com/2017/06/23/gun-training-faster-colorado-teachers-administrators/,"Trending: If someone begins shooting at the students or staff at Fleming K-12 School in northeast Colorado, football coach and bus driver Scott Muller wants to be ready to shoot back. “Something like this is nothing you want to do,” Muller said during a break from the active-shooter training course he took this week. “But anybody who wants to protect kids, they will take something like this on.” After all, said Muller, it’s unlikely help would be nearby if someone attacked Fleming School, about 20 miles east of Sterling. The local sheriff told him “they are so far out they won’t be able to respond in time to do much. It will be pretty much left up to someone at the school to do something.” Muller is among 17 teachers and administrators from five mostly rural counties who received  intensive training this week on how to prevent — or at least minimize — a mass shooting at their schools, many of which are in far-flung areas where it would take law enforcement up to 30 minutes to respond. Each participant already has a concealed handgun permit and is approved as a school security officer. As many as 20 Colorado school districts have designated teachers, administrators and other personnel as armed security. Helen H.

But the course work laid out this week by Ohio-based FASTER — Faculty/Administrator Safety Training and Emergency Response — is much more intense than a typical concealed weapons class in Colorado, said participants. “This,” said Muller, “is a whole new level.” Which means there is no sugarcoating of the consequences of not confronting someone bent on killing everyone within reach. “You will be killed if you do not fight,” said Chris Wallace, a 41-year law enforcement veteran, as he introduced students to the course. The educators sat in silence as Wallace showed slides of the results of past mass shootings and described in stark terms what might happen to victims in the next attack. “Adult males will be tortured and killed,” he said. “Females will be raped and killed. There will be no mercy involved in these situations. There is no talking yourself out of these situations.” Good training will remove unneeded emotion from your response to an attacker, Wallace told the educators. That will make a counterattack more effective, he said. “You’ve to get inside the moment,” he said. “Don’t go so fast that you miss what you need to see.” “When you engage the shooter, you need speed and surprise and violence of action,” he added. FASTER’s instructors — current or former law enforcement officers — have trained nearly 900 Ohio school staff members over the past five years. No matter their day-to-day roles — teacher, superintendent, librarian, coach, secretary — school staffers going through FASTER training are taught how to approach and shoot an active assailant. They are also tutored on hand-to-hand fighting skills, and they learn advanced medical training from a trauma surgeon. On the second morning of the training, the educators learned how to apply a tourniquet to a fellow student’s arm and leg in the midst of chaos, practicing the act of cutting off the flow of blood to keep someone alive. Later in the day, all 17 took to the shooting range where, under a blistering sun, they learned how to properly remove a handgun from its holster, quickly but surely approach an attacker and level their weapon to shoot. Just as important, instructors showed them how to safely holster their sidearms and wait for emergency help. The three-day class was held at the Weld County Sheriff’s Department shooting range. It was organized by Coloradans for Civil Liberties, a gun-rights group aligned with the right-leaning Independence Institute. Tuition is $1,000 per student, and the Independence Institute offered scholarships. “We have raised scholarship money because we never want the lack of training budget money to keep any school personnel from having access to this lifesaving training,” said Amy Cooke, the institute’s executive vice president. Graduates will be certified as exceeding Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training handgun qualifications, said Laura Carno, co-founder of Coloradans for Civil Liberties. “We want to give them world-class training so they can stop active shooters at their school,” Carno said. School districts that use staff as security personnel screen them extensively, say school officials. That includes administering psychological tests often used on law enforcement recruits. “The screening is pretty tough,” said Muller, the Fleming football coach. “I took a psychological screening, like other applicants. But some dropped out. And I can understand why. It’s tough that one day you may have to take down a student that you’ve known for a long time.” Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams offered use of the shooting range for training because he supports Second Amendment rights. He also wants rural school staffers to be able to protect themselves, said sheriff’s spokesman Matt Turner. “We all know there is anxiety about sending your kids to school and wondering if they will be safe,” Turner said. “We wanted to help in any way we can to ensure kids’ safety.” Fleming parent Carmen Vandenbark said most parents support school officials deciding to arm qualified staff members. Fleming is fairly remote and has no local police department, and response times from first responders can be lengthy. “It was a good, common-sense solution,” Vandenbark said. But others say active-shooter training for teachers will do little to protect students and might make a bad situation even worse. “In armed confrontations, trained law enforcement hit their target only 20 percent of the time,” said Eileen McCarron of Colorado Ceasefire, a group that opposes gun violence. “In a crowded classroom, what happens to the remaining 80 percent of the bullets? And how do we expect a nervous, far less-trained individual to perform anything but worse?” Ronnie Wilson said he took the training to help ease the fears of parents who worry about school security. “One of the first things parents ask about are academics, and the next thing is whether their kids will be safe at our school,” said Wilson. “And that is our highest priority.” Wilson is president of the governing board of Liberty Tree Academy, a K-8 charter school slated to open in Falcon, near Colorado Springs, next year. “This has been real eye-opening for me, and a great experience,” Wilson said of the FASTER training. “I know we can’t be prepared for everything. But I now know I’m better equipped to handle the worst kind of situation.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2017-06-23 07:16:34,"Colorado teachers, administrators train to take offensive against active shooter",,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking

In the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Tuesday, Palin’s lawyers say the Times “violated the law and its own policies” when it accused her of inciting the 2011 attack that killed six people. The lawsuit refers to a June editorial in the Times on the recent shooting of Louisiana Congressman Steve Scalise. The editorial was later corrected.   Palin is seeking damages to be determined by a jury. A spokeswoman for the Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, says they haven’t seen the lawsuit but will defend against any claim vigorously.  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

106,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/19/bill-oreilly-says-he-is-going-to-launch-30-minute-web-show-hints-at-fox-news-competitor/,"Former Fox News fixture Bill O’Reilly is getting ready to return to face the camera. “I am starting my own operation,” O'Reilly told his fans during a question-and-answer session at an event on New York's Long Island this past Saturday, following a program he staged with comedian Dennis Miller. According to O’Reilly, he will be launching a 30-minute web show that will have more than a few similarities to his old Fox News enterprise. “We will go into a studio and here it will look like ‘The Factor,’” he said, according to Newsday. “It’s basically an experiment to see how many people are going to want this service. That’s coming and will be here before September in a robust form.” The ousted Fox News host spoke at length about President Donald Trump, saying that he believed it was “almost impossible for me to analyze him fairly” because both men were being attacked by left-wingers. O'Reilly's departure from the network began when The New York Times revealed that Fox News had paid at least $13 million in settlements to women who claimed they had been harassed by O'Reilly and other employees. If his new 30-minute webcast develops an audience, there's a strong possibility that he might be willing join forces with another television operation, O'Reilly said. “I suspect there will be another network maybe merging with us. There will be a network that rises up because the numbers for Fox are going down,” he said. During the New Yorker’s time as host of “The O’Reilly Factor,” Fox News dominated the cable news ratings, attracting more viewers in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic as well as among total viewers. Since O’Reilly’s forced departure in April, MSNBC programs routinely earn more viewers than their Fox News counterparts. In May, “Extra” reported that O’Reilly's lucrative contract did not include a noncompete clause that would have precluded him from working with another television operation. O’Reilly has been trying to poach producers from his former employer, according to a Mediaite report. “We are assembling a team of journalists and are considering a number of options as BillOReilly.com is quickly developing into a major enterprise,” O’Reilly told Mediaite. O’Reilly and Miller’s Saturday appearance was the first of the duo’s “The Spin Stops Here” tour. Several more dates are scheduled, including shows in Baltimore; Tampa, Florida; Las Vegas and the Los Angeles area. Originally, the tour was also supposed to include O’Reilly’s protégé Jesse Watters, a former producer on his program who has since become an on-air personality for Fox News. In May O’Reilly said on his podcast that Watters would still be featured during tour shows. Since O’Reilly's ouster, he has been making weekly appearances on the radio program of Glenn Beck, a fellow Fox News alumnus. During a June 16 segment on ""The Glenn Beck Program,"" O'Reilly lashed out at The New York Times for incorrectly claiming that former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin had inspired a mass shooting. ""They are not a newspaper anymore. That's not a newspaper,"" O'Reilly said. ""That's a far-left progressive journal that actually coordinates its coverage with far left-groups.""

109,http://www.cleveland.com/darcy/index.ssf/2017/06/congressional_shooting_darcy_c.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Given the toxicity of the nation's political discourse, it seemed to be only a matter of when, not if, there would be another major act of domestic political violence carried out.  ""When"" was on Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, as a shooter opened fire on Republican members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game against their Democrat colleagues. Using a rifle and gun, James T. Hodgkins, who had expressed hatred for President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress, shot four people before being shot and stopped by Capitol Hill and Alexandria Police officers. Hodgkins struck House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and lobbyist Matt Mika, both men remain in critical condition.  Also shot were Congressional staff member Zachary Barth and Capitol Hill Police officers Crystal Griner and David Baily. The Capitol Hill Police, who attended the practice as part of Scalise's security detail, are being credited with preventing a potential massacre. Such an attack seemed to be sadly inevitable with the boiling political environment that has enveloped the U.S. over the past decade.    Would anyone have really been surprised if there had been an assassination attempt against President Obama during his two terms, or President Trump now? On the same day of the Alexandria mass shooting, another mass shooting took place at a San Francisco UPS facility, during which a disgruntled employee killed three co-workers. In Alexandria, America's old national pastime - baseball - was overtaken by America's new national pastime -mass shootings.   Mass shootings across the nation have become so common, the UPS shooting, that left three dead, received only minor press coverage. The country is plagued by a mental illness that leaves people with the mind set that the best way to resolve their grievances  is to conduct a mass shooting.  Such acts used to be rare, and at one time, unheard of, now they've become the new norm. Why?   If only Obamacare and Trumpcare had a remedy for the nation's mass shooting sickness. President Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, all set the right tone and sent the right message with their responses to the Alexandria attack.   Republican and Democrat leaders need to continue to set the right and responsible tone, even after the story fades from the front pages. All of us who participate in this nation's political discourse and help shape it, should reflect on what happened on that baseball field in Alexandria, and consider how we contribute to the health of our political dialogue for the betterment of the nation.

110,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-violence-idUSKBN1931HD,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Laila Kearney 3 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - More LGBT people were killed in the United States in 2016 than in any of the 20 years since record-keeping began, with the total boosted by the deaths of 49 people in an attack at a gay club in Florida last June, an advocacy group said on Monday. The release of a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs coincides with the first anniversary of the massacre at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Excluding Pulse victims, 28 Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender were killed in 2016, which was up 17 percent from 24 killed the previous year, according to the annual report. The number of killings last year was the highest since 2012, when 25 LGBT people were killed. Including Pulse victims, murders of LGBT people rose 217 percent in 2016. Not all of those killed in the nightclub attack were LGBT. “The enormous tragedy at Pulse Nightclub, in concert with the daily violence and discrimination that pervades our lives as LGBTQ people ... have created a perfect storm of fear and trauma for our communities this year,” Melissa Brown at the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, a member of the coalition, said in a statement. The “Q” in “LGBTQ” refers “queer,” a term that avoids specifying sexual orientation or gender identity. The coalition, which has released the report since 1997, said LGBT people remain vulnerable to violence in 2017, especially in what it described as the current “incendiary political climate.” “Recent executive orders as well as ongoing efforts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation and roll back protections at the city, state, and federal level make LGBTQ people vulnerable to identity-based discrimination,” Beverly Tillery, with the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said in a statement. Of the 2016 killings not connected to Pulse nightclub, 79 percent of victims were black or Hispanic and 68 percent were transgender. LGBT people of color and those with disabilities were more than twice as likely as whites and the able-bodied to be the victims of harassment and non-fatal forms of violence, the report said. Most of the victims knew their attackers, who commonly included employers, neighbors, landlords and family members, it said.

By SEUNG MIN KIM, BURGESS EVERETT and HEATHER CAYGLE 06/14/2017 05:58 PM EDT Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin – advocates of stricter gun laws – have spoken about the feeling of resignation for their party in the gun debate. | AP Photo One year ago, Sen. Chris Murphy sprang into action almost immediately after a gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub — accusing Congress of an “unconscionable deafening silence” and launching a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor. But the gun-control advocate who once argued that lawmakers should put forward “legislative action within an hour of a shooting” was more circumspect on Wednesday after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in the suburbs of Washington. One tragic incident, he acknowledged, won’t move the needle — even one that affected one of their own, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). “This is very personal. I mean, Steve is a friend of mine and frankly my time this morning has been dedicated just to making sure that my friends are OK,” Murphy said. “The way you talk certainly is affected by the fact that your priority is that the people you know are still alive.” The Connecticut Democrat continued: “We’re beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings. I mean, we don’t. We don’t. After Orlando and Sandy Hook, that’s clearly not how people’s minds work here.” The shooting Wednesday morning on a sleepy suburban baseball field — injuring Scalise and four others — horrified Capitol Hill, which has cycled through repeated rounds of tense battles over gun policy after mass shootings in recent years. But on Wednesday, the tone among even the most ardent proponents of stricter gun laws was dramatically different. In multiple interviews, several Democratic lawmakers urged that no, today was not the day to revive the dormant gun control debate. It was too soon, it hit too close to home — and lawmakers simply didn’t want to stand accused of politicizing a shooting that injured a colleague and friend. “We don’t know the facts,” pointed out Sen.

Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who helped steer the debate over background checks as Judiciary Committee chairman in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. “People know my record … but today is not the day for that. I’m praying for the victims. I’m praying for the police officers.” “Today we need to focus on what happened and our prayers have to be with the injured,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “We can talk about other issues in the future.” Congressional Democrats have taken notably sharper and more aggressive tactics in recent years when it comes to advocating for tougher gun laws. The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando spurred the most visible action — not only Murphy’s filibuster but a sit-in led by House Democrats in the chamber that lasted more than 25 hours and captured national attention. But Democratic lawmakers tiptoed around the gun issue on Wednesday. Notably, several Democrats asked to speak without attribution for fear of being seen as insensitive so soon after one of their colleagues was shot. They acknowledged privately that if the shooting of another colleague — former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) — and the mass shooting in Newtown didn’t move the dial, this won’t either. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and another advocate of stricter gun laws, also spoke about a “feeling of resignation” for his party in the gun debate. “Until there’s significant changes around the country or within Congress, we know each other’s positions and we know they don’t change,” Durbin said. “There’s a fatigue. We know each other’s arguments. We know what’s going to happen.” Democrats say they’re not abandoning their push for tougher gun laws, but they didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about it too quickly after Wednesday’s shooting, which occurred around 7 a.m. during the GOP lawmakers’ practice in advance of the annual congressional baseball game Thursday.

Chris Murphy, D-Conn. and other Democratic senators call for gun control legislation in the wake of the mass shooting in an Orlando LGBT nightclub. | AP Photo “I think that both sides of the aisle are going to be pretty disciplined on just focusing on [the victims] today,” Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) said. “And then tomorrow we’ll probably, hopefully respectfully, get back to the debates of what kind of policies we should have.” Even lawmakers who have seen an uptick in death threats against them recently like Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) weren’t ready to revive the gun debate. Green became the target of lynching threats after calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “I think these are issues that I would feel more comfortable discussing a little bit more removed from what happened today,” he told reporters following a briefing for House lawmakers on Wednesday’s shooting. “I don’t want someone to think that I’m seizing on this as an opportunity to get into a debate that may seem political in nature.” There were other differences between shootings that prompted gun control pushes from Democrats and what happened Wednesday, such as that the massacres in Newtown, San Bernardino and Orlando were tragedies of a significantly larger scale, with upwards of dozens of fatalities. In Wednesday’s shooting, only the suspect — identified by law enforcement officials as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois — has died. Hodgkinson had often published social media posts lashing out at Trump and the GOP, stoking concern from Republican lawmakers about whether they will be targeted because of their party label. Last June, Democrats in the Senate prompted the most sweeping debate over gun policy since the aftermath of Sandy Hook, when the chamber considered restricting firearms access to those with ties to terrorism and to bolster background checks. But the deeply divided chamber rejected all four measures put on the Senate floor for a vote. Three years before that, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) teamed up on a comprehensive background checks proposal in the wake of Sandy Hook. It was ultimately filibustered by nearly all Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate. On Wednesday, Manchin downplayed speculation about whether the shooting would prompt any concrete legislative action tightening rules on gun ownership. By DARREN SAMUELSOHN ""It always spurs that,"" Manchin said of a new gun control push. ""I just don't get overexcited anymore."" Another Republican who backed Manchin-Toomey — Sen. John McCain of Arizona — said Wednesday that reviving a gun debate would “be fine with me, whenever they want to.” But most other GOP lawmakers have long resisted enacting new and tougher firearms restrictions. “I own a gun; I don’t go around shooting people with it. Bottom line: People get shot, run over by cars, stabbed. It’s just a crazy world,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “If we had that debate it’d end like it always ends. We’re not going to tell law-abiding people they can’t own a gun because of some nut job.” Indeed, as legislative battles over gun policy raged in the Senate, the GOP-controlled House did not take up firearms measures on the floor, even in the aftermath of Orlando. A House panel on Wednesday had been scheduled to take up legislation making it easier to purchase gun silencers — the most significant movement on gun rights measures under the new Trump administration — but that hearing was postponed. The legislative standstill in Washington has forced supporters of additional gun restrictions to confront a difficult reality on Capitol Hill — is it even possible in this political climate to enact tougher laws while balancing constitutional rights to own firearms? “I don’t know who this person is,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said, referring to the shooting suspect. “But obviously someone who is very sick and if he had a criminal background … then yeah, shame on us. But Second Amendment is the Second Amendment.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

The Republican team members, preparing for a traditional charity event Thursday night, were practicing at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Va., at around 7 a.m. Wednesday when the gunfire started. Police said the accused gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, had taken a position behind a fence near the baseball diamond.

Witnesses said the five-term House representative was hit in the mid-section and rushed into surgery at the MedStar Hospital Center in northwest Washington. A hospital spokeswoman said Scalise, 51, remained in critical condition following his first surgery. A congressional staffer, Zach Barth, and food industry lobbyist Matt Mika were also wounded by the gunfire. Mika's family said he is also in critical condition. Another lawmaker and police officer also received minor ""secondary"" injuries, the FBI said at a Wednesday evening news conference. The second injured congressman was not identified.

RELATED Suspected ballfield shooter belonged to anti-GOP groups The FBI said Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., died after he was shot by police. Two firearms were recovered from the scene -- a 9 mm handgun and a Chinese-made SKS 7.62 mm assault rifle, CNN reported. A bystander with a cellphone camera happened to be recording at the time the first shots started, and captured the event.
RELATED Watch: Trump gives remarks on ballfield shooting The Washington Post, citing law enforcement officials, reported that Hodgkinson owned a home inspection business but had not renewed his inspection license after it expired in November. In 2006, he was charged with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle. Hodgkinson was said to belong to multiple anti-Republican political groups and was distressed over the election of President Donald Trump last fall. Last year, he volunteered for the Democratic campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who condemned the attack Wednesday. ""I am sickened by this despicable act,"" the Vermont senator said. ""Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.
RELATED Trump, Pence cancel events after baseball practice shooting ""I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.""
Advertisement The New York Times ran a story Wednesday that included a photograph which showed Hodgkinson protesting outside an Illinois post office in 2012, with a sign that read, ""Tax the rich."" Authorities said Wednesday afternoon that it was too early to determine if the attack was a targeted shooting or an assassination attempt. ""Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol Police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,"" Trump said after the attack. ""Our brave Capitol Police perform a challenging job with incredible skill and their sacrifice makes democracy possible."" ""We are united. We are united in our shock,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said. ""We are united in our anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us."" Democratic members of Congress, some of whom were also scheduled to practice Wednesday, held a group prayer for their colleagues. ""House Democrats praying for our House GOP [and] Senate GOP baseball colleagues after hearing about the horrific shooting,"" Rep. Ruben J. Kihuen, D-Nev., wrote on Twitter. ""On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our hopes and prayers for the wounded,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added.
Advertisement Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona lawmaker shot during a 2011 assassination attempt, on Wednesday said her ""heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the U.S. Capitol Police -- public servants and heroes today and every day."" The FBI said Hodgkinson had been living out of his vehicle in the Alexandria area since March, and urged the public to come forward with any additional information about the suspect -- including why the Illinois suspect might have been in the D.C. area. Wednesday's shooting is the 154th mass shooting so far this year, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Ryan said Thursday's charity baseball game at Nationals Park will be played. Earlier Wednesday, Scalise's office said the congressman was in stable condition, good spirits, and expressed gratitude for the actions of the Capitol Police officers who were part of his security detail at the baseball park. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., attended the practice and said he heard ""at least 50 or 60 shots"" -- and that Scalise was on second base when he was hit. ""[Scalise] goes down but is moving, and is crawling towards the outfield ... I'm seeing shots skipping off of the warning track,"" he said.
Advertisement Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., described what he said was a ""very strange"" encounter with a man shortly before the shooting who might have been the shooter. ""I actually left a little early, probably about a couple of minutes before this happened ... there was a guy that walked up to us that was asking whether it was Republicans or Democrats out there, and it was just a little odd, and then he kind of walked toward the area where all this happened,"" DeSantis said. Security was increased at the U.S. Capitol and the White House immediately after the shooting. Both buildings are less than 10 miles away from the Alexandria ballpark. The FBI is looking into Hodgkinson's recent activities, including inflammatory social media posts that might have belonged to him. Two now-removed Facebook posts that may have belonged to Hodgkinson were highly critical of Trump. ""Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.,"" a post in March purportedly said, according to NPR. ""He wasn't evil,"" an acquaintance of Hodgkinson's, Dale Walsh, said Wednesday. ""I guess he was tired of the politics.""

114,"http://berkshireeagle.com/stories/donald-morrison-americas-last-taboo-subject,511336"," BECKET - The 20th century Chicago writer Nelson Algren is remembered for his novels ""A Walk on the Wild Side"" and ""The Man with the Golden Arm,"" both of which were made into movies. Algren is perhaps better known for this advice: ""Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. And never get into a conversation about gun control."" Actually, that third one is my own. Nelson's version isn't suitable for a family newspaper. Besides, mine is as true as it gets. Gun control is a topic guaranteed to lose friends and influence nobody. I have the scars, from social media fights and tense discussions with friends and family members, to attest to the wisdom of my rule. But after the recent shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise and three other people at a baseball practice just outside Washington D.C., I wondered if, finally, there might be some bipartisan momentum for taking up the problem. Looks as if I was wrong. Since the shooting, we've heard a lot about the shooter's politics and personal life, the rising incivility of American political discourse and the ability of Democrats and Republicans to convene, a day later, for a congenial and emotionally uplifting baseball game. What we have not heard is how to reduce the frequency of mass shootings. Ah, mass shootings, something America does better than any country on earth. We've had more than 150 of them so far this year, about one a day (two on the day of the baseball incident, the other claiming four lives at a UPS facility in San Francisco). In all, 20,000 Americans have been shot in 2017, of whom 7,000 died. We've become so used to shootings, mass and individual, that just about the only way to get headlines these days is to hit a congressman. We also know the mass-shooting ritual: those ""thoughts and prayers"" for victims and families, the clucking over contributory factors like drug-fueled gang wars, violent entertainment, inadequate mental health care, uncontrolled immigration, social media, lousy parenting. Eventually, somebody brings up our super-easy access to firearms, which — like our gun-death problem — has no parallel in the civilized world. That's the conversation to avoid if you want to keep your friends. Giffords turning point People on one side of the debate think making guns harder to get is a sin against the Constitution. People on the other side note that fewer guns would mean fewer gun deaths. Those two notions are not entirely incompatible, and the areas of possible compromise are well-known: tougher restrictions on the mentally ill, domestic abusers, suspected terrorists, large-capacity magazines, weapons storage, gun shows. But the bodies pile up, and somehow nothing gets done. So for years I avoided discussing gun control. Then I met Gabby Giffords. It was at fund-raiser for the political action committee she started in 2013 to press for legislative solutions to the problem. That was two years after a gunman killed six people and shot her in the head at a constituent gathering in her Arizona congressional district. She told me she still had trouble forming complex sentences and using her right arm, but it was apparent that her determination and her sense of urgency were intact. ""We're won't reduce gun deaths,"" she said, if I recall correctly, ""until we start electing people who want to."" That's why she started her PAC. And that's why I now risk losing friends — maybe you — by bringing up America's last taboo subject: gun control. It shouldn't be all that taboo. Polls show a majority of Americans favor at least some of the steps mentioned above. None of them would make a huge dent in our ghastly death toll, but even a small improvement would be worth the effort: lives are at stake. So let's keep talking about gun control, until something gets done. Who knows? Maybe the bipartisan amity that blossomed in Congress after the baseball shooting might produce some consensus on preventing a repeat. Nelson Algren, who died in 1981, grew up in poverty and wrote about the violent underside of American society. I think he would understand my choice, this time, to ignore his — or, rather, my own — advice. Donald Morrison is a member of The Eagle's Advisory Board and a U.S. Army veteran.

The alleged shooter at the UPS facility died after turning an assault pistol on himself after officers confronted him, San Francisco police said. The tragedy came only hours after a man unleashed a barrage of gunfire at Republican members of Congress practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia.

In San Francisco, the suspect fatally shot three UPS employees and wounded two others at the UPS warehouse and customer service center in San Francisco, near 17th Street and San Bruno Avenue in the Potrero Hill neighborhood. Five others suffered minor injuries trying to get out of the building during the panic. One of the victims was identified by the San Francisco Chronicle as 46-year-old Hercules resident Mike Lefiti, a longtime UPS driver. San Francisco police identified the other two shooting victims as Wayne Chan, 56, and Benson Louie, 50, both of San Francisco, KGO-TV Channel 7 said late Wednesday. The shooting was reported shortly before 9 a.m., but police did not release any more details. UPS spokesperson Steve Gaut confirmed that four UPS employees, including the shooter, had been taken to hospitals. “The company is saddened and deeply concerned about affected employees, family members and the community we share,” Gaut wrote in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those touched by this incident.” Two firearms were recovered at the scene, said San Francisco police Sgt. Michael Andraychak. A San Francisco police department official has identified the gunman as Jimmy Lam. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation into the shooting is ongoing. The official said Lam is from San Francisco but had no immediate details on his background. A union official said the gunman had filed a grievance complaining that he was working excessive overtime. Joseph Cilia, an official with a local Teamsters Union, said Lam’s grievance filed in March requested that UPS relieve him of working overtime going forward. Still, Cilia said Lam wasn’t angry, and he could not understand why he would open fire on his colleagues at a morning meeting on Wednesday. Cilia said two other drivers who were wounded have been released from the hospital and will be OK. Authorities secured the building, and a San Francisco Police Department special operations units searched the facility for additional victims and witnesses, according to the department. Uniformed UPS employees were led out in a line by officers next to a highway. They walked away calmly with emergency vehicles nearby and gathered nearby outside a restaurant. Two bodies were found inside the UPS facility and two outside the building, police said. Authorities have not released identities of the slain. Brent Andrew, a spokesman for Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said the hospital had received the victims, but he did not know exactly how many people or their conditions. A witness said she believed the suspect was a driver who shot at other drivers during a morning meeting at the facility that operates as a packaging sorting hub and delivery center, according to ABC7. Officials, UPS employees and neighbors described chaos and panic as shots rang out during the meeting. “They were all in rapid succession,” Raymond Deng, a 30-year-old tech worker who lives across the street from the warehouse, said of the gunshots. “It was like tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.” Auto shop owner Robert Kim said he heard about five to eight rapid gunshots. The next thing he knew, he said, “there’s a mob of UPS drivers” running down the street screaming “shooter, shooter.” A UPS worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was working on the second floor when the shooting broke out on the third floor and did not hear the commotion. But he confirmed that the shooting happened at the morning roll-call meeting for UPS drivers. He said that he was friends with one of the victims, nicknamed Big Mike, a driver who he said died at the hospital. He also said he knew the shooter, also a driver, whom he described as “a shy and quiet person” who he believes had been working for UPS for eight to 10 years. “I was surprised because he was a quiet guy,” he said. “He didn’t talk much … and he killed himself, too, after he killed the others. … I don’t understand because he had a family. I feel so sad.” He said several of his co-workers were crying, with heads down in shock and disbelief. “I couldn’t believe it,” he said. “We never expected that.” In a statement, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee expressed gratitude for the first responders and sympathy for those who lost loved ones. “I want to thank our brave officers of the San Francisco Police Department, and our dedicated employees at 911 and San Francisco General Hospital. I also want to offer my condolences and thoughts for the individuals and families affected by the senseless act of violence at the UPS facility. We all know the familiar faces of our local UPS drivers and delivery persons. Today’s tragedy will be felt in every community served by these committed employees.” State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, also shared his thoughts. “Praying for the shooting victims at the UPS facility in San Francisco. Way too many shootings in this country. It’s depressing,” Wiener tweeted. The Salvation Army, Red Cross and other agencies were working together to provide counseling and support to employees still reeling from the shooting.

X OUR PICKS: Amid the national fury over the death of Philando Castile at a traffic stop in July – a shooting made more horrific by his girlfriend’s Facebook Live broadcast of his final moments – some condemned the National Rifle Association’s near silence on the matter. The organization had been quick to defend other gun owners who made national news. Castile had a valid permit for his firearm, reportedly told the officer about it to avoid a confrontation, and was fatally shot anyway after being told to hand over his license. So some NRA members were furious when the organization released a tepid statement, more than a day after the shooting, that merely called it “troublesome” and promised that “the NRA will have more to say once all the facts are known.” A year later, the investigation is over and many more facts are known. Police recordings and court records confirmed initial reports that Castile had tried to defuse the situation, assuring the officer that he wasn’t reaching for his weapon. On Friday, a jury acquitted the officer, Jeronimo Yanez, of manslaughter. So, some gun rights advocates are once again furious. And the NRA still has nothing to say. Related Articles

			Fully vaccinated Americans may enter Canada as of mid-August The Washington Post couldn’t find any statement from the organization about the verdict in Castile’s case, and the organization did not respond to requests for comment Sunday. Phillip Smith, who leads the National African American Gun Association, said he hasn’t seen any NRA statements since July. “And I’ve been reading pretty diligently,” he said. “It troubles me tremendously when I see a young man following the rules, doing what he’s supposed to be doing, and there’s still no accountability from a legal perspective.” The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus told the Associated Press that the jury had effectively told African Americans that “the Second Amendment does not apply to them.” A writer for Slate also received no response from the NRA when he wrote about the officer’s acquittal, prompting him to write: “If Castile had been white instead of black, the NRA would have been rallying behind him and his family since the moment of his death, and fundraising off his memory for the rest of time.” A year ago,the NRA’s own members were calling out the organization, as The Washington Post wrote. “What do I pay fees for if you do not represent gun owners and our rights?” one wrote on the group’s Facebook page. As described in a criminal complaint from Yanez’s trial, the first moments of Castile’s traffic stop ring true to Smith’s experience as a black gun owner. “Black men are feared in this country,” he said. “They put their hands on their gun and say, ‘Don’t make any sudden movements.’ ” Smith said he knows the unspoken rules of any police encounter – rules that go beyond laws and constitutional rights. “Definitely don’t move at all,” he said, keep your hands on the steering wheel, “take baby steps with the officer until they’re comfortable.” In Castile’s case, according to the complaint, he told Yanez, “I’m not pulling it out” – a few seconds before the officer drew his own gun and killed Castile. “We should all carry a gun now,” Smith said. “We all have that right. We’re not going to let a rogue officer or a rogue legal decision sway us.” Anger about the officer’s acquittal has managed to unite critics from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. The National Review’s David French, for instance, once wrote that “it’s hard to recall a political movement built on more verifiable lies and misinformation than Black Lives Matter.” But after the Yanez verdict, French’s opinion matched that of Black Lives Matter protesters. He wrote of the officer: “Whether he panicked because of race, simply because of the gun, or because of both, he still panicked, and he should have been held accountable.” He added: “The jury’s verdict was a miscarriage of justice.” And still, nothing from the normally vocal NRA, which once released a statement two days after a mass shooting in Orlando: “Destroy radical Islam, not the right of law-abiding Americans to protect themselves.” But nothing is clear cut when it comes to guns and race in the United States, said Nicholas Johnson, who lectures on both at Fordham Law School, and wrote a book called “Negroes and the Gun,” and is a black gun owner. The NRA has championed black gun rights heroes before, Johnson notes – such as Otis McDonald, who fought Chicago’s handgun ban. In return, he said, the group was accused of exploiting civil rights issues. On the other hand, he said, gun owners were still “perceived to be kind of an odd minority” within the black community – not exactly a constituency worth angering police over. “Your political calculation, I think, at the NRA is: OK, so we can come to the rhetorical aid of moderately despised contingent of a minority that already doesn’t like us,” Johnson said. “What’s the upside?” — By Avi Selk Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Jones never gave a direct answer in a segment on NBC’s “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” Kelly has been criticized intensely for giving a platform to Jones, who has also called the Sept. 11 attacks an inside job and promoted the false story that a pizza place in Washington, D.C. was the site of a child sex ring. She has defended her decision by noting that his influence has grown with the rise of President Donald Trump, who has praised Jones and appeared on his radio program. “Here’s the thing, Alex Jones isn’t going away,” she said Sunday night.

But he added that he remained skeptical after he “watched the footage” of children leaving the building. “Some of it looks like it’s real but then what do you do when they’ve got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up. I’ve watched the footage,” he said. “That looks like a drill.” The segment with Jones combined Kelly’s interview with background on his history of false remarks, his relationship with Trump and comments from Newtown parent Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in the shooting. When Kelly asked him whether he had anything to say to Jones for Father’s Day, he responded, “I think he’s blessed to have his children to spend the day with, to speak to. I don’t have that.” Last week, Jones leaked an audio recording of what he said was a phone conversation with Kelly, heard promising she would not portray him as “some kind of boogeyman.” Shortly before Sunday’s night interview, Jones released a Father’s Day video in which he offered condolences to families who had lost children in the “horrible tragedy” of Newtown, but did not refer to his previous comments disputing the killings. “Parents should never have to bury their own children,” Jones said. Connecticut’s NBC affiliate said Friday it wouldn’t air the report. In an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, NBC Connecticut staff members were told station executives made the decision after listening to concerns from employees, Sandy Hook families and viewers and considering “the deep emotions from the wounds of that day that have yet to heal.” Lawyers who represent 12 people who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook urged NBC News officials not to air the interview. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told the AP that the Jones story would be edited with its critics in mind. The interview also was seen as a test of the interviewing skills of Kelly, the former Fox News star whose questions two weeks ago for Vladimir Putin were widely panned for being too easy on the Russian leader. An unaired segment obtained by Huffington Post showed Kelly telling him that “virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia.” Kelly challenged Jones from the start, introducing him as a “radical conspiracy theorist” and promising to confront him on his “notorious lie” about Sandy Hook. The two frequently interrupted each other as Kelly kept asking if he would admit to his wrongdoing and a visibly tense Jones kept deflecting her questions, blaming the media for distorting his remarks or veering between acknowledging and disputing the tragedy. “I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil’s advocate,” he said. Answered Kelly: “Of course, there is no evidence on the other side.” Related Articles

			Fully vaccinated Americans may enter Canada as of mid-August Jones also downplayed his connection to Trump, who has spoken warmly of him and at times seemed to use conspiracies aired on Infowars in his campaign speeches. “I think my influence on Trump is way, way lower than what MSM (mainstream media) has said,” he commented, saying he and the president were “friendly,” but not friends. After spending more than a decade at Fox, Kelly signed a multimillion dollar contract with NBC earlier this year. Her star power had grown after she challenged Trump during a 2015 Republican debate on his history of sexist remarks and the candidate responded with a series of angry tweets and other comments, sometimes crude and personal, and boycotted a later debate because she was one of the moderators. She then was a key figure in the downfall of former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, telling in-house investigators of inappropriate conduct by Ailes that supported Gretchen Carlson and other women who had made similar accusations. Kelly wrote of her battles with Trump and Ailes in her best-selling memoir from 2016, “Settle for More.” Kelly’s old employer needled her over the weekend, sending a tweet headlined “Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones: NBC News under fire for ‘botched’ rollout.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Trump and Ryan asked the nation to turn away from the angry rhetoric that permeates politics today and move toward more civil discourse. Trump, in a call for unity, said, “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country. We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans … and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.” Ryan said that “for all the noise and fury (between Republicans and Democrats), we are one family. We do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber. … We are united. We are united in our shock, we are united in our anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.” James T. Hodgkinson, the Illinois man who is suspected of shooting Scalise and four others, had a record of social media postings attacking the Republican Party and Trump. But it’s too soon to draw conclusions about his motives. After the shooting of Rep.Gabby Giffords and 19 others in Arizona in 2011, people quickly concluded the motive was political. But in the weeks that followed, it became clear that Jared Lee Loughner’s mental instability was the main factor. Still, the angry and divisive tone of political discourse is taking a toll on civic life in America. It’s obvious at town halls and rallies as well as social media, where nuances are all but lost. Trump and Ryan, as leaders of the majority party, have an opportunity here. They can reach across the aisle in Congress and agree to be more respectful of one another’s viewpoints. Clear the slate and start over. Even better, they could use the moment to seek common ground on how to reduce the number of multiple shootings that now are on the increase. The Gun Violence Archive reported that Wednesday’s mass shooting at the ball field was the 154th this year, and we’re only 165 days in. The number didn’t include the shooting at a UPS facility in San Francisco later Wednesday that killed four people, including the shooter, who was reportedly a UPS employee. Making America safer isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue. Politically motivated violence is a small fraction of the problem. America needs bipartisan, independent research of the cause of mass shootings and what works and what doesn’t work in slowing the bloodshed. President Trump and Paul Ryan seem to have opened a door. It gives us hope. Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2017-06-14 14:29:04,"Editorial: Rally behind Trump, Ryan call for unity in wake of shootings",,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/

(AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner)  WASHINGTON (AP) — In the nation’s capital, at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul, and in dozens of other cities across the U.S., supporters of LGBT rights mobilized for marches and rallies Sunday, celebrating their gains but angered over threats to those advances. The centerpiece event, the Equality March in Washington, was endorsed by virtually every major national advocacy group working on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Leaders of those groups have been embittered by several actions of President Donald Trump’s administration — including the rollback of federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. The activists also complain that Trump, although he campaigned as a potential ally of gays and lesbians, has stocked his administration with many foes of LGBT-rights advances, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Throngs of marchers, many thousands strong, paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol, trailing behind a giant rainbow flag near the head of the procession. “We’re here, we’re queer, get that Chito out of here,” was among the chants directed at Trump.

Among the marchers in Washington was Gil Mendez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled with his partner all the way from San Francisco to join the parade. He carried a sign that included the names of all the Pulse victims. Related Articles

“The arrack on Pulse really struck me hard,” he said. “It made the connection between the physical violence of guns and the political attacks on our community.” Also marching, and singing freedom songs along the way, was Gregory Elfers of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was with fellow members of the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus. “It’s an opportunity to tell everyone we’re still here, and we’re not going away at all,” he said. Roughly 100 marches and rallies were planned across the U.S., from Portland, Maine, and Boston to Anchorage, Alaska, and Honolulu. More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out in Los Angeles where the annual Pride Parade was renamed the ResistMarch.

			Is Megyn Kelly dooming new show? Sandy Hook parents blast her choice of guests		

Jones, whom The Washington Post has described as a “conspiracy-spewing” radio host, has long dismissed a gunman’s shooting rampage that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. The gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Adam Lanza of Newtown, also killed his mother and himself. Jones has called that massacre a government hoax. His critics say that by inviting him on “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,” Kelly was legitimizing his views. Some personally affected by the Sandy Hook shooting decried both Kelly and NBC. Now, several organizations appear to be following suit. Kelly will no longer host the Promise Champions Gala, an annual event for the Sandy Hook Promise Foundation, a nonprofit gun violence prevention group founded by family members of some of the Sandy Hook shooting victims, the organization announced late Tuesday. The event is scheduled to be held Wednesday in Washington, D.C. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director of the organization, said in a statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that JPMorgan Chase pulled its local television and digital ads from all NBC News programming until after Sunday’s interview airs. A company spokeswoman declined The Post’s request for comment on the report. Earlier Monday, the company’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted, “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why?” Even Jones publicly questioned the interview. “I’m calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook,” he tweeted Monday afternoon, along with a 41-minute YouTube video. “Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here, and she said the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there,” he said in the video, adding that he believes children died during the shooting but that he wanted to play “devil’s advocate” since his listeners expressed doubt. “My listeners questioned it. … I played devil’s advocate by saying maybe none of it happened and it was all fake,” Jones said in the video. “The other side of me believes those parents I’ve seen on TV, and real mass shootings happen, so it probably did happen.” Kelly defended her decision on Twitter, stating it was important for her to “shine a light” on Jones, given that he remains relatively unknown even though President Donald Trump has both appeared on Jones’s show and complimented the controversial radio host. She also pointed out that Infowars, Jones’s organization, was given a temporary press credential last month. “Many don’t know him; our job is 2 shine a light,” Kelly tweeted.

""I'm sorry that he did this, but there's nothing I can do about it,"" she said, according to interviews posted on St. Louis television stations' websites. Suzanne Hodgkinson said she thought her husband had traveled to Washington to focus on tax issues but had not known much of what he was doing. She works for a tax firm, she said, and was busy in recent months. Facebook page of Virginia shooter's wife becomes heated public battleground The couple had been married for 30 years, she said, and he'd sold almost everything from his business before moving out to D.C. in March. She said she thought he was going to return to Illinois because he'd run out of money. Suzanne Hodgkinson asked reporters to leave the area, saying that she and her family had been through enough. Richard Wagner, chief deputy of the St. Clair County sheriff's office, said afterward that Hodgkinson was told about the shooting by a journalist and has been with the FBI since the shooting. ""She had no idea he would do this. She had no idea he felt as strong as he did,"" Wagner said. ""She's just devastated."" In Belleville, residents continued to grapple with the news that one of their own, a man many knew could be quick to anger, but who many said didn't show outward signs of violence, could have committed the mass shooting. Tom Reis has owned the popular T.R.'s Place about a mile from Hodgkinson's home since 1997. ""It makes you feel real bad that something like this is connected to here,"" Reis said. ""We had policemen and even the FBI in here asking questions, but we just don't know him."" A half-dozen patrons gathered at the tavern Thursday afternoon for the $1 taco special and to shoot pool said Hodgkinson didn't hang out there and wasn't known to them. ""What makes a guy do something like that? I think it's terrible,"" Reis said. ""It doesn't matter whether you're Republican, Democrat, black or white, Muslim or whatever. You just don't go out and shoot someone."" Jack McClenahan, a retired Belleville business owner, said he had several unpleasant run-ins with Hodgkinson over the years while Hodgkinson protested a favored Democratic political cause outside the local post office. ""He would get politically aggressive. I go down to the post office quite often, and he would be there collecting signatures on things he was for, and if you weren't of his opinion, he'd be very agitated,"" McClenahan said. ""It was super shocking for our town because you don't want bad press, and this is about as bad as press you can get,"" he said. cmgutowski@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ChristyGutowsk1 CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-06-15 08:00:00,Wife of Virginia shooter James Hodgkinson: 'I'm sorry that he did this',,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/
122,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/guns-and-college-football-texas-law-puts-coaches-in-tough-situations/,"Play Now Fantasy Football Play Now Golf Props RB Tiers Covering the impact of coronavirus on the sports world AUSTIN, Texas -- Bob Harkins knows a little bit about the mental, social and philosophical impact of carrying a weapon. The University of Texas' associate vice president, campus safety and security trudged up infamous Hamburger Hill in the bloody 1969 battle that cost 72 American lives during the Vietnam War. ""I spent 27 years in the Army,"" Harkins said. ""I put a round in the chamber when I was fixing to kill somebody. I didn't walk around even in a war zone with a round in my chamber."" On a warm winter morning earlier this year, Harkins made that statement in the context of evaluating Texas' still-new concealed carry law. It was a year ago this month the state of Texas became the eighth state to allow concealed weapons on its campuses. In one of the nation's richest athletic departments, campus life got a bit more complicated. Suddenly, there are potentially a lot of rounds in chambers of guns on this renowned campus carried by young, sometimes inebriated, not-yet-fully-mature college students. The law states students are allowed to carry licensed, concealed weapons on the Texas campus and in certain buildings. Former coach Charlie Strong had to adjust his core values, which include honesty, treating women with respect and not using drugs or owning guns. Banning guns is not as simple here or elsewhere as other bedrock principles for coaches. In Kansas, it's theoretically unlawful for coaches to ban guns because of what are the nation's least-restrictive gun laws. Coaches at the University of Texas may try to ban guns from their program, but they cannot legally ban players from taking them into classrooms. That bothers some professors. ""Carrying a handgun and the possession handguns is prohibited at all Longhorn sporting events,"" Texas spokesman John Bianco said. ""UT athletics has the discretion to include practices, scrimmages and training session in that exclusion as well. Thus, if a student-athlete is licensed to own a gun, that is their right, but they cannot bring it to the football facilities or at football functions."" We said it was complicated. Given the tragedies at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Virginia Tech, the question needs to be asked: Why doesn't every coach in the country ban guns right now? The answer, increasingly: They can't even if they want to. This state is a good place on which to focus because of its abundance of Division I high school talent. Texas produces about 250 such recruits each year. ""College campuses, they're supposed to be safe places,"" said Jim Grobe, who spent the last year of his career coaching in Texas at Baylor in 2016. But long before the current administration took office in Washington, there was a philosophical shift in this country when it comes to gun laws. In the United States, there are an estimated 300 million firearms, almost one for every person. That's twice the per capita number as 50 years ago. Texas has had concealed carry laws (that excluded campuses) since 1995. The open carry of guns -- in public places but not on campus -- was allowed beginning January 2016. ""I never really grew up thinking I need a gun for people,"" said Oklahoma State wide receiver James Washington, a Texas native. Washington is an avid hunter who says he owns about nine guns for that purpose. ""I think most of that is coming from where our world is now. With all those shootings, it really changes people's minds,"" he added. The modern debate over campus gun laws may have started here more than half a century ago. On Aug. 1, 1966, Charles Whitman climbed the University of Texas clock tower carrying out what is thought to be the nation's first mass shooting. ""A lot of things came out of that shooting,"" Harkins said. ""If you listen to audio tapes from radio stations here in town, they're saying something to the effect, 'Hey, that old boy is shooting off the tower. Can y'all bring your hunting rifles down and help us get this kid off the tower?'"" Out of that tragedy came the development of SWAT teams and emergency response plans. Neither Strong nor current Texas coach Tom Herman would comment for this story. Herman is beginning his 16th season in the state as a player or coach. What was hardly a discussion 10 or 15 years ago now must be accounted for in athletic departments -- and NFL locker rooms -- everywhere. ""I know guys that -- even thought it's against the rules -- put guns in their cars,"" said Sage Rosenfels, who played quarterback for five NFL teams during an 11-year career. ""It was against the rules to put guns in their cars in the parking lot, and they would still do it."" Sociologist and civil right activist Harry Edwards was so incensed at the law that he cut ties with the university that sponsored his lecture series on campus. ""That [law] destroys the very core of educational ethics,"" said Edwards, who for years was a consultant for the Bill Walsh-led 49ers. ""The open discussion and debate concerning critical issues. ""If I'm teaching a class ... and [a student is] reaching down, I don't know whether they're reaching for a pencil or reaching for a gun. I refuse to deal with that. ""This is a horrible situation. In no way does this make any sense."" University of Texas law professor Steven Goode helped craft the campus' response to the law. ""Every time there is a mass shooting, one group of people say, 'We need to work on gun control,'"" Goode said.  ""Another group of people look at the same event and say, 'This proves more people need to be carrying guns.'"" Meanwhile, since the Texas law was passed a year ago, there have been no gun-related incidents on the Austin campus. And so it goes. There is a Texas gun culture that goes back before the state's founding in 1845. ""I did take a gun away from a guy one time,"" said Mike Leach, who spent a decade in the state at Texas Tech. ""He was flashing it around at a party. Really, it was just a prop. I said, 'You have one choice: Either I'm going to kick you off the team or you're going to go out to the car and give me the gun and give me the ammunition and I'm never going to see it again.'"" The player never saw the gun again. Whether that could happen today with the myriad laws and increased attention paid to the Second Amendment is debatable. ""You try to set up your program up with certain core values,"" Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen said. ""We've taken the team to church before. Some people think that's wrong."" In the Second Amendment, the so-called ""right to bear arms"" is a military term rooted in states' ability to drive off Indian tribes or foreign invaders. Law professor Carl Bogus has suggested the 226-year-old amendment to the Constitution had particular value in the South where states used militias for slave control. Bogus wrote: ""The basic instrument of control was the slave patrol"" that would ""impress upon the slaves that whites were armed, watchful and ready to respond to insurrectionist activity …"" Try selling that interpretation to Texas State Rep. Allen Fletcher, who sponsored Senate Bill 11. ""Kids don't need a gun on a college campus,"" said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy. ""There will never be a solution. My personal opinion is guns are dangerous in college."" Why does anyone need the right to carry a concealed weapon on a campus? ""It's something the NRA has been pushing in state after state,"" said Goode, who helped craft the school's response to the August 2016 implementation of campus carry. ""… I'm deeply skeptical of the claims that this has increased safety at all. There is no data to support that at all."" Players hunt. It's legal if they are of age and properly trained. They can legally own and keep rifles. That has been dealt with for decades among coaches. Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre remembers his time at rural Tennessee-Martin from 1993-96. ""Kids drove around with a gun in the back in their hunting rack,"" he said. ""If we had a game that was open on a hunting Saturday in November, there was nobody there. We'd make sure it was an away game."" Bianco noted that Texas students must be 21 to carry. The majority of Longhorns' athletes would be of age to carry weapons. It is estimated that fewer than one percent of all University of Texas students have licenses. Applying that filter, Goode estimates only 500 of the 50,000 total Texas students are both the required age of 21 and licensed gun owners. Grobe had no gun issues during his one season at Waco. However,  he remembers landing one recruit back at Wake Forest who was impressed because ""he could squirrel hunt on campus."" Private Texas schools such as Baylor, SMU and TCU are exempt from such state laws. Those universities can ban guns. ""You can't even have a BB gun on our campus or you're going to get written up,"" TCU coach Gary Patterson said. ""That solves my dilemmas."" Another Grobe player at Wake, linebacker Zachary Allen, felt threatened when he had a gun pointed at him at a 2012 Christmas party. Allen went out and legally bought a .40 caliber hand gun and filled out the correct paperwork. After listing his campus address, he was charged with a felony for having a weapon on Wake Forest's private campus. Allen avoided the maximum two-year prison sentence, instead getting probation and community service. ""I was a little miffed because he was 21 and he can have a gun,"" Grobe said. ""But I don't want him to have one. I don't want a kid to feel he's got to use one ever. ""The school suspended him for a semester."" Allen's situation speaks to a larger issue of why players feel like they need to have a hand gun in the first place. Last year, one of Alabama's best players was caught with a stolen gun. He was not prosecuted. To comply with the least restrictive campus gun laws in the country, University of Kansas officials are in the process of building elaborate screening machines at venerable Allen Fieldhouse. Each machine will be staffed by an armed guard. ""What the hell is my state coming to?"" chided Patterson, a native of Rozel, Kansas. When the first Texas campus carry law went into effect 22 years ago, ""[they] were telling me it's going to be blood in the streets. It's going to be terrible,"" Harkins said. ""It wasn't terrible."" The Texas campus, though, is adorned with myriad signs regarding the law. Concealed firearms are allowed in buildings but not near labs that have flammable materials. There are 1,800 such labs on campus. The requirements can change from day to day depending on what materials are being used. ""If somebody wants to come shoot me … having a sign on my door that says they're going to be convicted of trespass if they shoot and kill me in addition to murder probably isn't much of a deterrent,"" said Goode. The same goes for warning signs outside Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. It is a Class A misdemeanor to carry a firearm into the 100,000-seat venue. And if it's about a right to bear arms, why does that right stop at the entrance to a football stadium or -- as the law also states -- student health and patient care facilities? A similar law recently passed in Georgia allows concealed carry at tailgates but, thankfully, not in campus childcare centers. Guns were going to be allowed inside Razorback Stadium at Arkansas until the governor signed an amended version of the state's concealed carry law. Up until that point, guns -- but not umbrellas, as a security measure -- would have been allowed in the stadium. ""It's only a matter of time before the arms race outstrips the campus police's ability to deal with it,"" Edwards said. Gundy has been recruiting in Texas for most of his career. His Oklahoma State program feeds off Texas talent. Having to deal with guns in his program hit him about eight years ago. ""That scared me,"" Gundy said. ""… I tell [players] all the time, 'You probably don't know what you're doing. You think you do, but you don't.' In the last six or seven years, I've only been aware of one our own guys that have had [a gun]. We told him to take care of it. ""I'm not naive either. If I have five guys flunk a drug test in a 12-month period, I'm thinking there are probably 15 guys and we only caught five."" Guns are so much a part of the Texas culture that it's easier to get in the Capitol Building in Austin with a handgun than without one. Licensed gun owners have a dedicated line that allows them to breeze through detectors while the non-gun toting public has to wait. The incongruity doesn't end there. Last August, students protested the law by hanging dildos from their backpacks. The open carry of sex toys is potentially illegal. Hidden guns are not. ""Cocks not Glocks,"" the students chanted. The issue, Goode said, ""seems to have faded into the woodwork."" ""When Charlie Strong came, people praised him on his core values and sort of strict discipline,"" he added. ""If he won some more games, they'd still be praising him for it."" © 2004-2021 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The centerpiece event, the Equality March in Washington, was endorsed by virtually every major national advocacy group working on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Activists have been embittered by the Trump administration’s rollback of federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. They also complain that Trump, who campaigned as a potential ally of gays and lesbians, has stocked his administration with foes of LGBT rights, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Throngs of marchers, many thousands strong, paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol, trailing behind a giant rainbow flag near the head of the procession. “We’re here, we’re queer, get that Cheeto out of here,” was among the chants directed at Trump. For the LGBT community nationwide, it’s an emotional time. Monday is the anniversary of the mass shooting a year ago in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people — mostly Latinos — at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Among the marchers in Washington was Gil Mendez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled with his partner all the way from San Francisco to join the parade. He carried a sign that included the names of all the Pulse victims. “The attack on Pulse really struck me hard,” he said. “It made the connection between the physical violence of guns and the political attacks on our community.” Also marching, and singing freedom songs and patriotic songs along the way, were scores of members of gay choruses from various cities. “It’s an opportunity to tell everyone we’re still here, and we’re not going away at all,” said Gregory Elfers of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was with a contingent from the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus. “We have to be heard — we have to be sure we’re not trampled on,” said L. Owen Taggart of Washington’s Gay Men’s Chorus. The roughly 100 marches and rallies across the U.S. included the first-ever gay pride parade in Grosse Pointe, a prosperous Detroit suburb. It began at Grosse Pointe South High School to emphasize support for teens who are gay or transgender. Two 15-year-old marchers, Jessica Dodge and Shekinah Aho, held hands and wore shirts that said, “Make America Gay Again.” The Los Angeles pride parade was renamed the ResistMarch, and tens of thousands turned out in Hollywood, some carrying rainbow flags or signs reading “Love Trumps Hate.” Speakers included Mayor Eric Garcetti, U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, and RuPaul, the host of “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Waters led the crowd in a chant of “Impeach 45.” “We’re going to take our country back from him,” she said. “I know that you have the strength. I know that you have the courage. And I know that each of you understand you have the power.” Back in Washington, the activist leaders on hand included Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, which monitors media coverage of the LGBT community. She noted that Trump, breaking from the practice of Barack Obama, has declined to issue a proclamation in honor of Pride Month, and that the Trump administration has deleted questions about sexual orientation from planned federal surveys. “If you look at their prioritization, we’re really low on it,” she said. “There absolutely is a resistance aspect to this march.” ___ David Crary reported from New York.

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO, Fla. -- Hundreds of people have left flowers, cards and drawings at Pulse nightclub to remember the victims who were killed a year ago in Orlando, Florida. Many cried and strangers hugged each other during solemn remembrances on Monday as the names of the 49 victims of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history were read out loud. According to CBS affiliate WKMG-TV, multiple services will be held throughout the day. About 50,000 people are expected to attend an evening service in the heart of downtown Orlando at Lake Eola. A music-filled, late-night service will be held at the nightclub. Gov. Rick Scott has ordered for U.S. flags around Florida to be flown at half-staff. A giant rainbow flag will be unveiled at the Orange County government building. Church bells throughout the Orlando area rang 49 times at noon. The first ceremony was held shortly after 2 a.m., and was closed to the public. It was held for survivors, victims' families, club employees and local officials. It overlapped the time a year ago that gunman Omar Mateen started shooting inside the nightclub on ""Latin Night."" Pulse owner Barbara Poma and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer spoke to families and friends of the victims during the private ceremony. ""I realize that gathering here in this place, at this hour, is beyond difficult,"" Dyer said during the service. ""But I also know that the strength you've shown over the past year will carry you through today and in the future."" People laid flower and lit candles early Monday outside the perimeter at Pulse. The fence has been decorated with vibrantly-colored banners. Some dressed as angels and stood guard outside the club before the service. The private service was the start of what would be almost 24 hours of observations to remember the victims who died as well as the dozens of Pulse patrons who were wounded during the shooting. The Orlando Gay Chorus performed Rachel Patten's ""Fight Song"" during a second service, which was held around 11 a.m., outside of the nightclub. Monday's services culminated several days of events aimed at turning the grim anniversary into something positive. A foot race was held over the weekend, and eight gay and lesbian students were awarded $4,900 toward their college studies by a local businessman. Local officials have declared the one-year mark as a day of ""love and kindness,"" and they are encouraging residents to volunteer or perform acts of compassion. An exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre will be shown at the Orange County History Center. The club's owner, Barbara Poma, is developing plans to build a memorial at the Pulse site. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) during the attack and was eventually killed by police during a shootout after a three-hour standoff. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court, and she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband.

131,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/some-georgia-republicans-see-political-upside-tragic-shooting," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows The closely watched congressional special election in Georgia is tomorrow, and Republicans are more than a little nervous about losing a seat they assumed would be theirs indefinitely. Consider, for example, this Washington Post piece on some in the party seeing an electoral benefit from last week's D.C.-area shooting, which left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) clinging to life. Some Republicans see political upside in the tragedy. Brad Carver is chairman of the Republican Party in the neighboring 11th Congressional District, which is represented by Barry Loudermilk, a member of the GOP baseball squad who was on the scene during last Wednesday's shooting.""I'll tell you what: I think the shooting is going to win this election for us,"" Carver said Saturday after a get-out-the-vote rally for Handel in Chamblee. ""Because moderates and independents in this district are tired of left-wing extremism."" It's unsettling that anyone would look for partisan advantage in a mass shooting. It's even more alarming when someone feels comfortable making such an argument out loud, in front of a public audience. As for the idea that Jon Ossoff's moderate message deserves to be tied to the actions of a dangerous madman, that's obviously offensive, but the sentiment apparently isn't limited to Georgia's Brad Carver. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that a Republican group called the Principled PAC has launched a new attack ad, showing Steve Scalise being wheeled away on a stretcher. ""When will it stop?"" a narrator asks. ""It won't if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday, because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week's shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff. And if he wins, they win."" The same commercial, without proof, claims the left ""is endorsing and applauding shooting Republicans."" In case this weren't quite enough, other Republicans, hoping to give Karen Handel's (R) campaign an 11th-hour boost, are trying to deceive local voters. CNN reported: An outside group that supports President Donald Trump is running a radio ad in Atlanta ahead of Georgia's special election Tuesday that takes the voice of former President Barack Obama out of context to make the argument that Democrats take black voters for granted.Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump non-profit group that previously ran ads attacking former FBI director James Comey during his testimony, is running an ad that quotes Obama narrating his autobiographical book ""Dreams From My Father."" The ad, however, does not mention that in the selected passage, Obama is actually quoting someone else who is speaking about the black community and Chicago politics before the early 1980s. Ad campaigns like these are part of a massive investment on Handel's behalf from outside groups. While Ossoff has raised far more money for the race than his Republican rival, Handel has benefited from over $10 million in investments -- nearly all of which has gone towards attack ads -- from GOP entities that have intervened since the first round of balloting in April. © 2021 NBC UNIVERSAL",2017-06-19 12:30:26,Some Georgia Republicans see a 'political...,,359084,http://www.msnbc.com/#superglue

In the clip, Latifah and Jada Pinkett Smith drove around singing some Prince and yelling at fellow motorists to see their movie.

While it won’t be ready for its official unveiling until later this year, the highlight of the video is a quick look at the Steve Jobs Theater — a 1,000-seat glass auditorium named after the company’s late co-founder and former CEO.  Altogether, the new digs cost $5 billion, and will host more than 12,000 employees. The campus will cover 175 acres, include a 10,000 square foot gym, and run completely on renewable energy. It’ll also include one nostalgic piece of old tech; the Glendenning Barn, which has been on the property for more than 100 years. You can catch it inside the campus ring in the video.

138,http://www.ibtimes.com/pulse-nightclub-shooting-1st-anniversary-10-quick-facts-about-orlando-mass-shooting-2550777,"On June 12, 2016, a gunman opened fire in an Orlando nightclub early morning, killing 49 people and wounding another 53 in one of the worst mass shootings in the history of the United States. Omar Mateen shot party-goers at the gay nightclub Pulse with an assault rifle, firing dozens of rounds indiscriminately and even taking some people hostage. When he finally stopped firing, many people were already dead while dozens lay critically injured. Law enforcement officials said that the gunman pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group (also called ISIS) in a 911 call around the time of the attack; he died in a gun battle with SWAT team members. Monday is the first anniversary of the Pulse shooting. Read: Pulse Nightclub Plans Permanent Memorial To Honor Shooting Victims At the 47th Annual Boston Pride Parade on Saturday, the survivors of the Pulse nightclub also took part. Their float had 49 flags to honor the victims of the mass shooting.   Here are 10 quick facts related to the Pulse nightclub shooting. 1.  Mateen's family was from Afghanistan, and authorities said they later moved to Florida. Mateen was born in New York. His ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, who was with Mateen for only two months, told reporters that he was bipolar and ""mentally unstable."" She said they did not have contact for the last seven or eight years, the Associated Press reported. 2. Yusufiy said Mateen was short-tempered and had a history with steroids. She reportedly described him as religious but not radical. 3. Mateen was a security guard with a company called G4S. In a 2012 newsletter, the firm identified him as working in West Palm Beach. After the incident, the company sent a statement to the Palm Beach Post, confirming he had been an employee since September 2007. State records reportedly showed Mateen held a firearms license since at least 2011. 4. One of the most widely shared photographs from that night of tragedy was the image of a Kevlar helmet with a bullet hole in it. Orlando police identified Michael Napolitano as one of the officers who responded to the attack at the club. He was wearing that helmet due to which his life was saved. No officers were killed in the shootout, according to CBS-affiliate KHOU.  5. In total, 41 dispatchers, EMTs, paramedics and firefighters assisted on the scene the night of the shootings. Nearly a year later, they were honored by Orange County for their work that night, reports said. 6. ISIS had claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying the attack was ""carried out by an Islamic State fighter"" in a report on its official Amaq news agency. 7. Pulse, which branded itself as the hottest gay bar in Orlando, was a sprawling bar with several rooms, dance floors, and a few bars. Read: Will Pulse Nightclub Be Sold? 8. Pulse has shut down since the incident and will not reopen as a gay nightclub; it will become a memorial.  9. Although gay rights have been a divisive issue among Florida Republicans, nearly two dozen GOP officials in Central Florida signed a resolution last year calling for laws that banned discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, Fox 6 News reported. 10. Across the country after the incident, police departments stepped up patrols in neighborhoods frequented by the LGBT community.",2017-06-12 05:07:22,Pulse Nightclub Shooting 1st Anniversary: 10 Quick Facts About Orlando Mass Shooting,,41550,http://www.ibtimes.com/

                    Laura Santhanam Mass shooting incidents in 2017 unfolded in places that were hauntingly benign — 10 teens wounded during a high school party in Brownsville, Tennessee, a murder-suicide in a family’s home in Preston, Idaho, and three employees shot to death at a restaurant in Bowie, Maryland. Now add to that a gunman who opened fire Wednesday during a Republican Congressional baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia. A few hours later, a second gunman killed three coworkers at a UPS store in San Francisco before turning the gun on himself. These shootings shook the nation in ways all too familiar. For years, the United States has witnessed gun violence erupt time and again — in college classrooms at Virginia Tech, in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in a night club in Orlando, Florida, and the list goes on. In 2017 so far, there have been 196 shooting incidents with least four people wounded or killed. That’s up from 182 incidents over the same period last year, according to the Guns Are Cool thread, a crowd-sourced archive on Reddit.  While the incidents of significant gun violence are up, the number of people killed overall is slightly down from the same period last year, according to NewsHour’s analysis of 2017 data through June 14 on the GunsAreCool Reddit thread. So far in 2017, 281 people died in incidents involving at least four people, while last year, 284 people died. The Pulse night club mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, which claimed 49 lives in June 12, 2016, propelled last year’s figures forward.  The same holds true among the number of people wounded as a result of major shooting incidents. So far in 2017, 675 people have been injured. During the same period in 2016, 678 people received non-fatal gunshot wounds.  Politics obscures the way the nation counts mass shootings. Two decades ago, Congress threatened to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if the agency systematically studied the effects of gun violence in this country, the Washington Post reported. To fill the void, ad-hoc efforts, such as the Gun Violence Archives and the Reddit thread emerged, but there is debate about how legitimate those counts are. Left:

A group of children aged 12 to 16 were involved in the shooting, which occurred at The Roundhill of Cypress Station Apartments  in the 500 block of Cypress Station Drive, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office. A 16-year-old girl who was critically injured after being shot in the cheek, has improved and is awake, the sheriff's office reported. The other three children were treated with non life-threatening injuries and released from the hospital. The group of children were apparently involved in an argument with another group of teens at the apartment complex, eventually leading to several shots being fired. Witnesses were questioned  at the scene and a possible juvenile shooter is being interviewed, according to the sheriff's office. The shooting is still under investigation. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense  said in a statement Wednesday they were angered by the violence at the apartment complex. ""Simply put, children as young as 13-years-old should not be suffering from injuries related to gun violence,"" said Emily Keown, a volunteer with the Texas chapter. ""We can no longer afford to live in a country where our children pay the price for our nation's issue with gun violence."" Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America was started  after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Since its inception, a group has been created in every state across the country. The organization is fighting for solutions to lax gun laws and loopholes they believe jeopardize the safety of children and families. The group is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization, with more than three million supporters and over 140,000 donors advocating for public safety when it comes to guns. ""It is time for us to stand up and demand our lawmakers do more to keep our children safe,"" Keown said. ""The time to act is now.""

147,https://www.salon.com/2017/06/15/megyn-kelly-nbcs-first-lady-of-normalizing/,"In March 1997 veteran journalist Peter Arnett journeyed for CNN deep into eastern Afghanistan to interview a man relatively unknown to most Americans. The subject’s name was Osama bin Laden. Arnett and his crew were not allowed to use their own cameras. The reporter had to submit questions to bin Laden in advance and was not allowed to ask any follow-ups. In archival video of the interview, bin Laden's calm, measured explanation as to why he had declared war on the United States sounded just shy of understandable. CNN even illustrated his observations about the West's double standard in regard to terrorism (“If [children] throw stones against the Israeli occupation, it says they are terrorists,” bin Laden pointed out) with footage of small, skinny boys running from uniformed men wielding automatic weapons. [salon_video id=""14782144""] But CNN countered bin Laden with interviews from United States intelligence officials, explaining his ties to terrorist attacks on American interests that claimed innocent lives. These too were accompanied by devastating imagery, this time of American people being pulled from smoking ruins, their faces contorted with fear and agony. In doing this interview, bin Laden sought to sell himself to the Western world as a man of purpose, determination and intelligence. The al-Qaida founder was well aware that CNN, ABC and every other major outlet who sought him were granting a broad, powerful platform to espouse his views. In the interview segment, he said as much to Arnett when the journalist asks about his future plans. “You'll see them and hear about them in the media, God willing,” bin Laden answered. Four and a half years later on Sept. 11, 2001, bin Laden made good on that statement. Journalism’s purpose is to shed a light. Megyn Kelly is absolutely correct in making that observation. But knowing she does so in defense of her interview of Infowars host Alex Jones that, as of this article’s publication, is still set to air on her NBC newsmagazine “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” is troubling. It's too easy to dismiss Jones as a kook: All signs point to his being one, not to mention a hateful person. How else can you characterize the claim that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax? NBC's announced plans to feature Jones on her Sunday news program resulted in a massive outcry led by some family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. A number of these individuals say they have been harassed on social media by followers of Jones' program Infowars. JPMorgan Chase pulled its advertising, and Sandy Hook Promise, a group that advocates the prevention of gun-related deaths, canceled Kelly's planned appearance at its upcoming gala event. Their anger is warranted. It's wrong, however, to posit that Kelly or any other journalist should shy away from interviewing influential madmen, despots or agents of disinformation. Jones disseminates messages ranging from the ludicrous to the dangerous. Among his various claims to fame is his peddling of the theory that 9/11 was “an inside job.” But this is not the reason I bring up Arnett’s exchange with bin Laden 20 years ago. Rather, it offers proof that seeking out these exchanges can serve a purpose beyond a ratings grab. Arnett’s interview, as well as one conducted afterward by ABC News’ John Miller, explained why viewers needed to know the name of a man speaking to them from a cave in Afghanistan — a person with the power to reach across the ocean and tear asunder their sense of safety. And both Arnett and Miller knew how to handle a hostile interview subject, even one who sought to box them in with stipulations and rough conditions. The issues and conditions facing Kelly right now are wildly different from those Arnett and Miller dealt with. But the main question now is one those men didn't face, which is whether Kelly can handle Jones, a foaming-at-the-mouth conspiracy theorist who has President Donald Trump’s ear. Anyone who watched Kelly’s cozy one-on-one with Trump (following his long media feud with her) or her more recent conversation with President Vladmir Putin  two Sundays ago is correct to suspect that she’s not up to that task. Here's another important question: Is there truly value in ""shedding light"" on a man like Jones, a figure who attempts to soften his malignant influence by calling himself a performance artist? Or is Kelly simply doing her part to make Jones another part of the new version of normal? Let’s consider that tête-à-tête with Putin. What value did viewers glean from it? Over and over again Kelly pressed him on intelligence assertions that Russia hacked the 2016 presidential election and alleged connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign — questions the former KGB lieutenant colonel was ready to respond to with smooth denials, deflecting and redirection. Kelly managed to slide in one question that alluded to his suppression of journalism and free speech with no follow-up. Regarding Russia’s involvement with Syria or his view of Russia’s relationship to NATO or the European Union, Kelly asked . . . nothing. At a time when, according to data released in April by the Pew Research Center, some 31 percent of the Americans surveyed said they see Russia as presenting the greatest danger to the U.S., these would have been useful questions to ask. Putin would have obfuscated the facts in those instances, too — that’s what he does — but it would have been a different sort of denial, and that can be just as informative. But then anyone who has watched Kelly’s orchestrated displays of force in her former role at Fox News would have known this. The typical broadcast news consumer probably became familiar with Kelly from her humbling of Fox News contributor Karl Rove on the night the 2012 election results came in — or during the August 2015 Republican primary debate she moderated. That's when she confronted Trump on his history of misogyny, citing the fact that he had referred to women as “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” Not surprisingly these moments earned her the attention and something approximating respect from liberal voices in the media. As I have previously written, Kelly is a master of sculpting her image to fit her career goals. Her smackdowns of patronizing sexists such as Fox News host Lou Dobbs and conservative radio host Mike Gallagher were well-aimed haymakers on soft targets, a matter of a personality adored by her audience triumphantly stomping on a couple of blowhards who underestimated her willingness to go on the attack as well as her popularity. And one day she may prove herself to be a formidable interviewer. Somewhere deep down, she has the tools, although they could be a little rusty. Prior to entering the news business, Kelly spent a decade as a corporate litigator, a profession built on research, extensive knowledge of subject matter and a willingness to argue specific viewpoints. All of these are qualities hard-hitting reporting requires. It’s also important to remember that as part of her rise at Fox News, however, Kelly styled herself as a provocateur who enabled flimsy headline grabbers and guests whose views were, to put it kindly, factually challenged. People like these require a sharp sense of skepticism, not a resting defense. Two examples of this are her coverage of a conspiracy alleging widespread voter intimidation by a little-known group called the New Black Panther Party. Most people have never heard of it; if you have, it may be because you viewed one of Kelly’s 45 segments that aired in 2013 about an account of intimidation that has since been discredited. (This was merely one of many cases where Kelly engaged in race-baiting to rile up her audience.) As the host of “The Kelly File,” Kelly also made the president of the Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, a frequent guest, rarely countering his baseless anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. For that matter, Kelly also took part in pushing Fox News’ hysteria surrounding Benghazi. Again unless you watched Kelly with any regularity on Fox News before she set her sights on moving to a place where she could practice “real” journalism, these aspects of her interviewing style may come as surprising. Everyone evolves with experience, of course, and one may presume that Kelly will take more care with what she says about victims of police brutality or immigrants now that she’s at NBC News than she did at her previous place of employment. (Maybe.) Moreover, it is possible to use a broadcast platform to tear down dangerous people unfit for broad consumption. But if Kelly and her producers couldn’t call on any credible intelligence officials or dissidents to counter Putin’s propaganda, then we cannot count on Kelly lending much in the way of enlightening context to our consideration of Jones. Even “Full Frontal” host Samantha Bee was able to get Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen and dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza to go on the record, and he has been poisoned twice! The Infowars host himself purportedly wants NBC to pull the interview. From the little that I know about him, I suspect his furor to be ersatz in nature, part of a ploy to get more viewers to tune in. Outrage is a wonderful ratings magnet, and NBC and Kelly may be counting on that to gain exposure for a show that's struggled to attract viewers. In the end, this may illuminate more about the host of ""Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly"" and her new employers than telling us anything we don't already know about its controversial guest.

148,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/religion/~3/28NZ3t5dLHI/ct-orlando-workplace-shooting-20170605-story.html,"ORLANDO, FLA. — A man who was fired from a Florida awning factory in April returned Monday with a semi-automatic pistol and methodically killed five people, then took his own life at the sound of an approaching siren, authorities said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings identified the shooter as John Robert Neumann Jr., a 45-year-old Army veteran who lived alone and did not appear to belong to any type of subversive or terrorist organization. The shooting began after Neumann slipped through a rear door into the cavernous Fiamma Inc. factory, an area larger than two football fields where awnings are stitched together for recreational vehicles. He paused at least once to reload. ""My experience tells me that this individual made deliberate thought to do what he did today. He had a plan of action,"" said the sheriff, who wouldn't say why Neumann was fired. The gunman ""had a negative relationship with"" at least one of the victims. ""He was certainly singling out the individuals he shot,"" Demings said, adding that most victims were shot in the head. Some were shot multiple times. State and federal law enforcement officers converged on the industrial park in Orlando shortly after 8 a.m. after a woman ran out and called 911 from a tile business across the street, said Yamaris Gomez, that store's owner. ""All she kept saying was he was holding a gun and told her to get out,"" Gomez said. That woman had been hired after Neumann was fired in April, so he probably did not recognize her and knew she was not a former co-worker, Deming said. Searching for a motive, deputies cordoned off a trailer park in Maitland, where Neumann lived alone in a mobile home on a busy road next to a funeral home, a used car lot and a dog-grooming business. Like the awning factory, it's far from Orlando's famous theme parks. Deming said investigators also are looking through any social media postings for clues. Neumann was honorably discharged in 1999 and did not have a concealed weapons permit, the sheriff said. Arnie Boyd, who lives in the same trailer park, said Neumann was not particularly social. ""Every once in a while, he would ride his bike around and that's it,"" Boyd said. ""We would speak only once in a while."" The dead were identified as Robert Snyder, 69; Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44; Kevin Clark, 53; Jeffrey Roberts, 57; and Kevin Lawson, 46. Authorities had confronted Neumann once before at the factory, when he was accused of battering a co-worker in June 2014. But no charges were filed, and that co-worker was not among Monday's victims, the sheriff said. In a 2014 incident report, Neumann's co-worker said Neumann punched him in the back of the head when he approached, knocking him to the ground. But the co-worker later changed his story, saying that Neumann had chased him and then hit him on the back of the head. Neumann had a record of minor crimes, none violent, dating back nearly 20 years. Most involved traffic violations — driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, giving a deputy a false name and leaving the scene of a hit-and-run involving property damage. Fiamma calls itself one of the largest manufacturers of awnings for camper vans, motor coaches and sport utility vehicles. Shelley Adams said her sister, Sheila McIntyre, called her from the company's bathroom during the shooting and kept repeating, ""My boss is dead. My boss is dead."" Officers arrived two minutes after being dispatched, the sheriff said. The FBI also responded, said Ron Hopper, who runs the FBI's Orlando office. And while five people were killed, ""seven others' lives were saved due to the quick actions of the officers who arrived on the scene today,"" said Special Agent Danny Banks of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Authorities had no reports of any specific threats the gunman made to people at the company or anyone else, but that's why people need to alert authorities whenever they learn of anything that could lead to violence, Banks said. ""If people see something that seems abnormal, they need to say something,"" Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs added. The latest government statistics indicate that fatal workplace shootings have ticked upward in the United States. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a 2 percent rise between 2014 and 2015 to 417 cases. Among those, fatal shootings rose more sharply, by 15 percent. Sen. Bill Nelson called for more action to address mental health issues. He noted that next Monday will mark a year since the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The attack at the Pulse club killed 49 people and wounded dozens more. ""The city of Orlando, which is still healing from the Pulse massacre, has seen too much violence this past year,"" the Florida Democrat said in a statement. Republican Gov. Rick Scott asked ""all Floridians to pray for the families impacted by this senseless act of violence."" Associated Press Writer Freida Frisaro in Miami contributed to this report.

Chad Brooks - LiveScience Contributor
28 June 2017  The Second Amendment provides U.S. citizens the right to bear arms. Ratified in December 1791, the amendment says: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. James Madison originally proposed the Second Amendment shortly after the Constitution was officially ratified as a way to provide more power to state militias, which today are considered the National Guard. It was deemed a compromise between Federalists — those who supported the Constitution as it was ratified — and the anti-Federalists — those who supported states having more power. Having just used guns and other arms to ward off the English, the amendment was originally created to give citizens the opportunity to fight back against a tyrannical federal government.  Since its ratification, Americans have been arguing over the amendment's meaning and interpretation. One side interprets the amendment to mean it provides for collective rights, while the opposing view is that it provides individual rights. Those who take the collective side think the amendment gives each state the right to maintain and train formal militia units that can provide protection against an oppressive federal government. They argue the ""well regulated militia"" clause clearly means the right to bear arms should only be given to these organized groups. They believe this allows for only those in the official militia to carry guns legally, and say the federal government cannot abolish state militias. Those with the opposite viewpoint believe the amendment gives every citizen the right to own guns, free of federal regulations, to protect themselves in the face of danger. The individualists believe the amendment's militia clause was never meant to restrict each citizen's rights to bear arms. Both interpretations have helped shape the country's ongoing gun control debate. Those supporting an individual's right to own a gun, such as the National Rifle Association, argue that the Second Amendment should give all citizens, not just members of a militia, the right to own a gun. Those supporting stricter gun control, like the Brady Campaign, believe the Second Amendment isn't a blank check for anyone to own a gun. They feel that restrictions on firearms, such as who can have them, under what conditions, where they can be taken, and what types of firearms are available, are necessary. While the right to bear arms is regularly debated in the court of public opinion, it is the Supreme Court whose opinion matters most. Yet despite an ongoing public battle over gun ownership rights, until recent years the Supreme Court had said very little on the issue.  One of the first rulings came in 1876 in U.S. v. Cruikshank. The case involved members of the Ku Klux Klan not allowing black citizens the right to standard freedoms, such as the right to assembly and the right to bear arms. As part of the ruling, the court said the right of each individual to bear arms was not granted under the Constitution. Ten years later, the court affirmed the ruling in Presser v. Illinois when it said that the Second Amendment only limited the federal government from prohibiting gun ownership, not the states. The Supreme Court took up the issue again in 1894 in Miller v. Texas. In this case, Dallas' Franklin Miller sued the state of Texas, arguing that despite state laws saying otherwise, he should have been able to carry a concealed weapon under Second Amendment protection. The court disagreed, saying the Second Amendment does not apply to state laws, like Texas' restrictions on carrying dangerous weapons. All three of the cases heard before 1900 cemented the court's opinion that the Bill of Rights, and specifically the Second Amendment, does not prohibit states from setting their own rules on gun ownership. Until recently, the Supreme Court hadn't ruled on the Second Amendment since U.S. v. Miller in 1939. In that case, Jack Miller and Frank Layton were arrested for carrying an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state lines, which had been prohibited since the National Firearms Act was enacted five years earlier.  Miller argued that the National Firearms Act violated their rights under the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court disagreed, however, saying ""in the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."" It would be nearly 70 years before the court took up the issue again, this time in the District of Columbia v. Heller in 2008. The case centered on Dick Heller, a licensed special police office in Washington, D.C., who challenged the nation's capital's handgun ban. For the first time, the Supreme Court ruled that despite state laws, individuals who were not part of a state militia did have the right to bear arms. As part of its ruling, the court wrote, ""The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."" The court would rule on the issue again two years later as part of McDonald v. City of Chicago, which challenged the city's ban on private handgun ownership. In a similar 5-to-4 ruling, the court affirmed its decision in the Heller case, saying the Second Amendment ""applies equally to the federal government and the states."" In 2016, the Supreme Court again ruled on a right-to-bear-arms case, Caetano v. Massachusetts. The case involved a woman who was in possession of a stun gun for self-defense against an abusive ex-boyfriend. Because stun guns were illegal under Massachusetts law, the woman was arrested and convicted for possessing the weapon. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled that stun guns and, indeed ""all instruments that constitute bearable arms,"" are protected under the Second Amendment. In 2017, the Supreme Court declined to hear Peruta v. California, a gun-rights case centering around concealed carry, or the right to carry a concealed handgun in public. California requires that applicants for a concealed carry license show ""good cause,"" such as a specific threat to a person's safety. A Vietnam veteran named Edward Peruta challenged this requirement as a curtailment of his Second Amendment rights. While Heller was a case about keeping firearms in the home for self-protection, Peruta v. California was about whether that right extends to the public sphere. Justice Clarence Thomas and new justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the refusal to review the case, indicating that the Supreme Court's newest justice may be particularly conservative on gun rights. Meanwhile, the battle over gun rights continues at the state level. A 2016 working paper from Harvard Business School researchers found that a mass shooting leads to a 15 percent increase in the number of firearm-related bills introduced into the state legislature that year. The more fatalities, the larger the increase in firearm bills. But the bills aren't always what you might expect: When Republicans hold power in the state legislature after a mass shooting, the number of laws enacted to loosen gun restrictions goes up 75 percent. Democrat-controlled legislatures, on the other hand, did not enact a higher rate of regulation-tightening laws immediately after mass shootings than before. ""This is consistent with survey evidence suggesting that even when a majority supports a gun-control proposal, those opposed to increased gun control are more likely to take actions like writing a letter or donating money to support their side,"" the researchers wrote. Despite the recent rulings, the debate on gun control continues. Incidents like those in Aurora, CO and Sandy Hook in Newtown, CT only serve as motivation for both sides to have their opinions heard and considered.

151,https://www.bustle.com/p/the-alexandria-baseball-attack-is-the-154th-mass-shooting-this-year-64373,"News  On the morning of Wednesday, June 14, a gunman opened fire on a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, at a congressional baseball game practice. Reports suggest that five people were shot in the attack â including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, lobbyist Matt Mika, and two members of Scalise's security team â although mercifully, there haven't been any reports of deaths yet. The grisly, high-profile incident in Alexandria follows a dire trend of mass shootings, marking the 154th such attack in America in 2017 alone. Given the U.S.'s status as the gun violence capital of the developed world, acts of political violence have a much bigger reach in the news than random acts of violence do. It's worth noting that the motivations (if any) behind the attack have not yet been determined by law enforcement, so it's too early to say whether the GOP congresspeople were targeted for being politicians, or Republicans, or whether politics entered into the gunman's thought process at all. But when you run the numbers, as the Washington Post noted on Wednesday morning, it becomes clear that while a potential act of political violence is hugely worrisome, these kinds of acts of mass violence are terribly common. In fact, according to the Gun Violence Archive, the GOP baseball shooting marking the 154th mass shooting incident in the United States in 2017 lags just a bit behind one shooting per day so far. The pace of the mass shootings is slightly less than what it was in 2016, when a total of 384 mass shootings took place, according to the Gun Violence Archive. To be clear, the Gun Violence Archive defines âmass shootingâ as any incident in which four or more people are shot, not including the shooter, regardless of whether any of them are killed. Under certain federal definitions, deaths are a prerequisite for the âmass shootingâ label, although many observers and outside groups believe that to be a misleading standard. The current 2017 pace, assuming it continues as it so far has, would make this year a slightly less violent one for mass shootings than 2016, but only barely. Not to mention, summer months sometimes see spikes in gun violence, meaning that the pace could pick up as temperatures rise. In the case of the GOP baseball shooting, thereâs an added dimension of the victims being elected representatives. This marks the first time a national politician has been fired upon since the nearly fatal shooting of former Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, and from the sounds of things, itâs already causing some lawmakers to consider additional security measures. Itâs also worth noting that two potential Democratic political candidates have abandoned their intentions to run in recent weeks, citing death threats made against them. And with this latest shooting in Alexandria, the political climate appears to be going down a dangerous path.

A man walking his two dogs captured audio and video of the horrific moments when a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress at baseball practice Wednesday morning in suburban Washington, D.C. PBS NewsHour said it obtained the footage from Noah Nathan, who was walking his two golden-doodles near the Alexandria, Virginia, field where the shooting occurred. He dropped to the ground and recorded the horrific scene.

Later, someone is hurt while expressing concern for one of the shooting victims. The horrible spectacle unfolds over six minutes of video. There is a flurry of shooting around the four-minute mark, and then people are seen running, from a distance.

Roger Williams (R-Tex.) and two Capitol Police officers. The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old from Illinois. Hodgkinson, who had posted anti-Republican screeds — including against Scalise — was killed by law enforcement officers at the scene.

Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society,” the former Democratic presidential nominee said. Democrats and Republicans were preparing to face off for a charity baseball game when the shooting began. Democrats, practicing on a different field, bowed their heads in prayer for their Republican colleagues. In defiance of the violence, Democrats and Republicans plan to play the charity game as scheduled on Thursday. They will meet at Nationals Park.

By DARREN SAMUELSOHN 06/14/2017 11:28 AM EDT Updated 06/14/2017 05:34 PM EDT President Donald Trump’s first domestic mega-moment has arrived, and his measured reaction to Wednesday’s shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, is being praised by all sides as they gauge his temperament in a time of crisis. Trump touched on all the key notes in the immediate hours after the shooting at a congressional GOP baseball practice that sent five people to the hospital, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. His first remarks: A statement saying he and Vice President Mike Pence were “deeply saddened by this tragedy” and a tweet calling Scalise a “true friend and patriot.” Then, just before noon, the president embraced the role of sympathizer in chief, delivering a four minute-plus speech in the White House Diplomatic Room revealing that Scalise and two Capitol Police officers were in stable condition and confirming that the alleged gunman had died following the incident. In other large-scale moments since arriving on the international stage, Trump sparked controversy by referring to hot-button policy points, attacking his critics and getting ahead of confirmed law enforcement reports. All that was gone in his nationally televised remarks. “We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,” Trump said near the end of his remarks. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” the president added.

Earlier this month, Trump sparked an international uproar when he touted his controversial travel ban following a terrorist attack in London and mischaracterized its mayor’s attempt to reassure the public in the aftermath. During the heat of the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump after the Republican declared a bomb had detonated in New York before the local authorities had made that announcement. Trump also drew criticism in June 2016 when he issued a seven-paragraph statement in response to the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, criticizing President Barack Obama for not saying the words “radical Islam” after the shooting and urging him to “step down” because of the omission. A White House official said that while prepping for his remarks Wednesday, Trump was cognizant of the importance of his demeanor. “He wanted to hit the right tone. Moments like this give the president an opportunity to rise above politics and strike a certain chord that captures the sentiment of the nation, that’s unifying and that’s what he wanted to do.” Trump’s softer and more tactful approach earned him praise from an unlikely source: Democrats. “It looks like Trump and his team took this shooting seriously and acted accordingly. His statement was measured and respectful and hit all the right notes when he issued a call for unity,” said Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic spokesman who worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Added a former senior Obama White House aide: “I think he sufficiently played the part.” Republicans also applauded Trump for his immediate response. “I think he set the right tone and message,” said former George W. Bush White House spokesman Scott McClellan. “This is a time to set aside politics and for all of us to come together in support of those who were injured in this tragic shooting. The president has an important role at times like this to be the comforter in chief for the nation.” “Temperate, compassionate, and thoughtful — the president’s remarks met the test of the moment,” said Michael Steel, who served as a spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner. Beyond the initial White House statement and tweet on Wednesday morning, Trump stayed out of the spotlight as local and federal law enforcement officials pieced together the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia. Law enforcement sources named the suspected shooter about four hours after the incident as James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois. Those reports identified him as a supporter of Bernie Sanders, and his apparent social media accounts included anti-Trump posts. Sanders, in a statement, said he was “sickened by this despicable act” and condemned the shooting by “someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign.” The White House canceled a speech Trump was to give at the Labor Department later Wednesday afternoon. According to the White House, Trump spoke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Scalise’s wife and chief of staff, and the Capitol Police chief. Pence spoke with Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas GOP Rep. Joe Barton, Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake and a staff member who coaches the Republicans’ baseball team. While the president’s televised response Wednesday drew praise, amid the initial presidential silence several Trump surrogates started making charged public statements and even ascribing a motive to the shooting. The president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., issued a one-word post on Twitter — “This” — in sharing a tweet by conservative commentator Harlan Hill, who wrote: “Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.” The tweet was an apparent reference to a current Central Park production of “Julius Caesar” — who in the play is made to look like the president. Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway shared a post by a local South Carolina television reporter quoting South Carolina GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan, who said the shooter asked, “Is this a team of Republicans or Democrats practicing?” By KYLE CHENEY “#breakingnews.” Conway wrote. New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins placed blame on Democrats, saying in an interview with WBEN radio they need to “tone down” their rhetoric. “I can only hope that Democrats tone down the rhetoric,” Collins said. “The finger-pointing, the angst, the anger directed at Donald Trump and his supporters … some people react to those things.” Collins referenced a “die-in” protest that happened at his office several weeks ago regarding Obamacare. “Let’s hope we can disagree on a more polite, conversational basis and not do things like they did at my office a couple weeks ago. It’s gone too far,” Collins said. Several former Democratic White House aides in the hours after the shooting said they hoped Trump would avoid politics in responding to the first major domestic shooting incident of his administration. “The tone and the words coming out of the White House matter the most,” said the same former senior Obama White House official who later praised the president’s in-person remarks. “There may be a lot of breathless speculation in the press and an instinct to react strongly, but the sweet spot is typically one of respect, vigilance and considered thoughtfulness.” “In these moments, the public looks to the president to bring some rationality to what we all have difficulty rationalizing,” added a former Clinton White House aide. “It’s a time to be the healer in chief, not the tweeter in chief.” Tara Palmeri and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.

A couple of hundred people celebrating their sexuality —along with lots of supportive friends — boarded the 8:37 a.m. train decked out in colorful costumes with rainbow feathers, sequins and silver and gold glitter, as well as elaborate hairstyles with braided buns and rainbow extensions. The North Side parade, a tradition of the gay community for decades, stepped off as thousands looked on. Many said they have experienced a liberating relief associated with sharing they were gay, bi-sexual or transgender, while others said they were going to a ""jubilant"" parade as a way to support the gay community and encourage love and acceptance. All said the parade is usually a lot of fun. Carolanne Davis, of St. Charles, accompanied by her friend, Dana Klausler of Naperville, was going to her first Pride Parade. ""It's actually a big deal for me. I came out about a year ago,"" said Davis, 20. Davis said she's acutely aware that not everyone in the gay community has the support of family and friends as she does. ""I kept it in deep for a really long time. I met people who encouraged me to come out about my sexuality. So much weight has been lifted off of my shoulders,"" Davis said. ""I don't have to feel as though I need to hide behind a wall. It's important to surround yourself around supportive people,"" she said. Davis said she is hopeful more people will not be so judgmental. ""There are a couple of friends who chose to have nothing to do with me. I am the same person. I do have a great handful of people who still adore me, and I am so grateful to them,"" she said. Klausler, 20, said she's proud of her friend. ""I'm optimistic future generations will teach their children to love everyone as they are, and the LGBT community will have more acceptance,"" she said. Some of the parade-goers think strides have been made, but they still have a long way to go. Last year's parade was held two weeks after the horrific mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orland, Fla., that left 49 people dead. Also last year, the Supreme Court decided same-sex couples had a constitutional right to marry nationwide. This year they are worried the Trump administration will roll back the progress made. ""We're people, too. It's not only about people who are straight and important,"" said Zoe Kowalczyk, 19. The St. Charles woman said she goes to the Pride Parade every year she can. ""After last year's shooting, (gay rights) is something we should pay more attention to. It's also a lot of fun,"" Kowalczyk said. Kowalczyk is studying political communication and environmental science and sustainability at the University of Colorado in Denver. She said she didn't struggle with her sexuality. ""I didn't really come out. It was more of a 'this is me — this is it.' There is nothing special or different about it. The problem is when people freak out about it. My family is super-supportive,"" she said. ""It's nice to have a parade dedicated to the gay community. A lot of people have lived suppressed lives for a long time. The mass shooting in Orlando attacked the gay community. Now Trump is trying to take away rights for gays, lesbians and anyone else in the LGBT community,"" Kowalczyk said. ""Why not go all out (in costume) in every way you can?"" she said. Nineteen-year-old Maxwell Spencer of Geneva came with Reese Petersen, 18, of Batavia, and their supportive friends Amanda Frazee of Batavia, Alexa Lemke of Geneva and America Gomez of Aurora. Spencer said he dated Lemke in seventh grade before he came to terms with his sexuality. ""Geneva is an accepting town. I came out in the eighth grade and haven't had trouble with it,"" Spencer said. ""We are fortunate to live in the area that we do. The Pride Parade is a peaceful way to celebrate our sexuality,"" Petersen said. Spencer and Petersen met on social media, and they are now friends. Spencer recalled last year's parade when police were guarding from rooftops. ""I feel safe going with that level of security,"" Spencer said. Michaela Fogel, 37, stood out on the train platform in pink and black camouflage denim with a matching hat. ""I am a female transgender,"" said Fogel, of Aurora. ""I actually rode one of the floats a couple of years ago. It was really exciting to wave to the crowds. I want to show my pride of who I am."" Straight families headed to the parade as well to join the festivities. Elizabeth Smith of St. Charles came with her husband and 9-year old daughter. ""Today more than ever it's important to promote tolerance and understanding,"" Smith said. ""I have talked with my daughter about what it means to be able to love who you choose to love. We need more tolerance and love in the world,"" the mother said. Marcy Wampach, 88, of Geneva, was headed for a Broadway play at the Goodman Theater and was surprised to see the crowds of people. ""Generally on a Sunday morning there aren't a whole lot of people at the station unless there's a ballgame. Everybody should feel free to celebrate who they are,"" Wampach said.

156,http://mashable.com/2017/06/12/lgbtq-violence-2016-how-to-help/,"When it comes to hate violence impacting the LGBTQ community in 2016, there's little good news. But there are ways you can have an impact moving forward. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) released its annual report on Monday detailing what the last year looked like for the safety and well-being of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people. The results are jarring—and an essential call-to-action. Unfortunately, 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ community in the 20 years the report has existed. A total of 77 homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected were reported in 2016, including the mostly Latinx LGBTQ people killed in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in June 2016. LGBTQ people of color, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people made up the majority of homicides within the community. The report was released on the one year mark of the Pulse shooting—the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history— which added 49 deaths to 2016's homicide toll. Even excluding deaths associated with the Pulse massacre, there was a 17 percent increase in homicides of LGBTQ people from 2015. The three main forms of violence encountered by LGBTQ people in 2016 were verbal harassment (20 percent), threats and intimidation (17 percent), and online or mobile harassment (13 percent). The majority of hate violence survivors surveyed—a sizeable 60 percent—identified as LGBTQ people of color. Notably, of the LGBTQ people who interacted with the police in 2016, 66 percent said that police were indifferent or hostile toward them. Though many inferred their LGBTQ identity played a role in the tense interactions, many queer people reporting tense interactions were black LGBTQ individuals, following along with the current critique of racism in law enforcement. The uptick in violence toward LGBTQ people is perhaps not a surprise, given the dramatic shift in the social and political climate of the U.S. in 2016. NCAVP says that the organization has seen an increase in people reaching out for support and resources since the candidacy and election of President Donald Trump, a man who was elected on a platform rampant with hateful rhetoric. ""Many LGBTQ people are fearful that people who hold bias beliefs will feel legitimized by seeing their beliefs being enacted into policies and political actions at the highest levels of our government,"" said Emily Waters, senior manager of national research and policy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. ""Efforts to pass discriminatory legislation and actions that would decrease the rights of LGBTQ people in housing, healthcare, education, and public accommodations target the exact places where LGBTQ people are reporting experiencing violence."" An essential part of the report is a call to action by NCAVP to mobilize around LGBTQ rights and acceptance, which is the only way to shift the tide. In the report, the organization includes suggested tweets that people can use to bring attention to especially notable statistics as well as shareable graphics to amplify the report's findings. ""Hate crimes legislation alone will not address the many ways homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, and other forms of oppression play out in our communities, in our workplaces, schools, and homes every day,"" Waters said. ""We want people to move beyond the numbers of violence and start taking action."" Here's a few ways NCAVP suggests taking action against LGBTQ hate violence: More in

159,http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/jordan-klepper-solves-guns-interview-daily-show-comedy-central-1201840002/,"Steve Greene Jun 9, 2017 12:46 pm @stevebruin Matt Salacuse When Jordan Klepper signed on for a day embedded with a Georgia militia group, he was expecting to find answers to solving the problem of gun violence in America. What he got — at least at first — was a quick workout. “It’s a fascinating experience to be a fly on the wall of a day of militia training. Something that we didn’t realize is that you forget how long a day it is. We arrived and did calisthenics for the first 30 minutes and it was just guys getting their heart rate going,” Klepper said in an interview with IndieWire. It’s just one example of how Klepper and a team of writers uncovered some unexpected results over the six months that spent researching America’s complicated relationship to firearms. The result is “Jordan Klepper Solves Guns,” a one-hour special premiering Sunday night on Comedy Central.  READ MORE: Jordan Klepper Is Following in Stephen Colbert’s Footsteps, But His Comedy Central Series Will Be Way Different  “Guns are such a wide-ranging topic,” Klepper said. “Are you talking about mass shooting? Are you talking about guns used in domestic violence? Are you talking about guns used by sportsmen? Are you talking about urban violence? I think what we kept coming back to was the debate around guns is the thing that gets so muddy and confusing.” That search for one policy answer that unites all sides of this issue is the natural evolution of the kind of field pieces that Klepper’s routinely done on “The Daily Show.” But Klepper explained that the extra time meant that he could really work to fashion a character-based version of himself that examined the way that people enter this debate as much as what happens when it starts. “With this, we wanted to have fun with this blowhard who sees himself as this righteous lefty, but who doesn’t know quite everything that he’s playing with. You feel this guy who really wants to solve the world’s problems, but doesn’t have all the tools. I love playing around with that kind of comedy,” Klepper said. Aside from the show’s runtime, Klepper explained how filming a portion of the special in his home state of Michigan led to recruiting some help from an unlikely source: his own cousin, Pete. “We started talking about these people who are in our families who might have different political leanings Is it possible to change their mind about some of these topics? Well, mine’s Pete. Pete is my cousin, who I love and who’s a Republican and posts pictures of himself hunting and will talk about Trump. We thought, ‘Theoretically, what would it take for a guy like me to change somebody like Pete’s mind when you talk about guns?’” Klepper said. Eventually, that theoretical scenario led to the special’s most surreal, unconventional segment: a faithfully reconstructed parody of “The Bachelor,” with Klepper on a pursuit for a moderate that might help him find a solution to curbing gun-related deaths in America.  READ MORE: James Comey Hearing: Late Night TV Reminds Us There’s No Silver Bullet For Trump Presidency “We needed to come up with a functional way to show moderate thoughtful points of view, but to sensationalize those where the joke is on us. That’s what ‘The Bachelor’ does. They functionally take people from the middle of the country, they add this layer of competition onto it and they sensationalize it so America eats it up on television. We were like, ‘Bingo! That’s exactly what we need to do here,’” Klepper said. What began as a comedic way to get an audience to better understand the mindset of those stuck in the middle of an ongoing political tug-of-war ended up having just as much effect on those people making the special as it did its subjects. “What we started to find in our research phase and as we talked to people is — lo and behold — it was our minds that really started to soften and become much more moderate and even at times, farther to the right than we expected. We’ll take this character and lead him headfirst, thinking it’s going to be an easy answer, but in real life it’s a little bit more complicated.” Klepper said. In a gun debate painted in media and entertainment as an impossibly divisive issue, “Jordan Klepper Solves Guns” shows that there’s far more common ground than many viewers might assume. Part of that uniting force is the work being done by organizations working to provide a peaceful, productive alternative to violence happening in communities across the country. The special has a companion website highlighting the groups working to provide pragmatic solutions nationwide. “After being in the weeds for six months talking about the gun issue, it really was heartwarming to see people who were like, ‘Yeah, fuck the politics of it all. It’s messed up. But I’m doing something.’ I think as we stumbled on these people who really were doing something and making a dent, even if they weren’t solving the whole issue, they were at least moving forward. There’s a little ray of hope that’s out there,” Klepper said. READ MORE: TV’s Newest Late Night Hosts Need to Follow Trevor Noah’s Advice in Order to Survive As for his future plans, when talking about his impending solo show that will serve as the nightly follow-up to “The Daily Show” when it premieres in the fall, Klepper’s character side slipped out one last time. “What becomes very clear is that I’m good at solving things,” Klepper said. “I promised Comedy Central, ‘If you give me a show, I’m going to solve all the world’s problems.’ So as long as they keep me on the air for six months, I think that’s a sure thing.” “Jordan Klepper Solves Guns” premieres Sunday, June 11 at 10:00 p.m.  Stay on top of the latest TV news!

161,http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/trumps-silence-gun-deaths-says-much-compared-obamas-many-speeches/1975279/," After the recent terror attack in London, President Donald Trump sent a snide tweet about guns, which impliedÂ strict gun laws don't do anything to reduce violence or terrorism. Handguns are outlawed in the United Kingdom and gun laws are highly restrictive, which helps save lives. If the attackers in London had used guns, it's highly probable far more people would've been killed, but Trump conveniently overlooked that fact. Monday's massÂ shooting occurred a week before the anniversary of the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a terrorist attack involving gunsÂ that left 49 dead -- the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. In total, including the five individuals killed in Orlando, at least 28 people were killed by gun violence across the U.S. on June 5, according to data from Gun Violence Archive. While it isn't a competition, that's four timesÂ the number killed in London (that attack claimed seven lives), and it happened within 24 hours. Monday's shooting in Orlando had nothing to do with terrorism; it was just another sad example of gun violence in America. In 2016 alone, gun violence claimed over 15,000 lives in the U.S. Even still, Trump has yet to recognize it as a major problem in this country. Moreover, it's well-documented terrorist groups like ISIS view America's loose gun laws as an asset. Harry Sarfo, a German man who joined ISIS and is now imprisoned, told The New York Times the terror organization aims to radicalize people over social media and encourage them to take advantage of how easy it is to get a gun in the U.S. Sarfo said, While Trump is fervently promoting a ""travel ban"" on six predominately Muslim countries in order to prevent terrorism, groups like ISIS are simply looking to radicalize folks online and send them to the gun store. Relatedly, it's worth noting the gunman at Pulse nightclub was born in Queens, not far from where Trump was born. He legally purchased the guns he used in the shooting on consecutive days roughly a week before the massacre. A travel ban wouldn't have prevented someone like him from getting into the U.S., because he was a natural-born citizen. Restrictive gun laws, however, could've prevented him from obtaining the firearms he used to murder dozens of people. Data shows states with tougher gun laws have fewer gun deaths, and there's extremely strong evidence background checks help save lives. But Trump isn't seemingly unwilling to recognizeÂ any of this. Meanwhile, Trump's silence on this issue has been deafening. The mainstream media's hyperbolic coverage of terror attacks hasn't helped either. The president has sent numerous tweets in the past few days, but none have delved into gun violence. Based on his past statements and actions, it seems safe to say TrumpÂ will not be prioritizing this issue whatsoever during his tenure, even as Americans continue to die. Trump'sÂ approach to gun violence couldn't be more different than his predecessor's. When former President Barack Obama addressed the shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub last June, it marked at least the 17th time he'd addressed a mass shooting as president. Throughout his time in office, Obama was extremely vocal about the need for the U.S. to recognize how big of a problem gun violence is, and how desperately it needed to act to change this. But he was consistently met by an obstinate Congress on this issue, led by Republicans with deep ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA). In January 2016, Obama was reduced to tears in the White House when discussing the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School andÂ announcing executive actions he was taking to address gun violence. Sadly, his efforts had a limited impact. But, to Obama's credit, he was always adamant that nothing would truly change on this issue without Congress, which has been unwilling to budge. Now thatÂ Republicans have a majority in Congress and a Republican president who has made it clear he has no plans on prioritizing the issue of gun violence, they're under no pressure to act.

162,http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/people-think-ariana-grande-better-responding-terrorism-trump/1963046/," Many people have taken a look at how pop-star Ariana Grande and President Donald Trump have responded to recent terror attacks in the UK and concluded the singer is betterÂ equipped to deal with terrorism than the president. In other words, a lot of people currently view a 23-year-old celebrity as a biggerÂ source of inspiration than the 70-year-old President of the United States. In response to the devastating terror attack that occurred at her concert in Manchester on May 22, GrandeÂ posted a heartfelt message of solidarity on Twitter, visited with victims in the hospital and hosted ""One Love Manchester,"" a benefit concert for the victims. The New York Times described Grande's benefit concert as sending a message ""of defiance"" to terrorism. Trump did what is arguably the exact opposite of what a leader should do in the wake of a terror attack: He was exceptionally divisive. The president tweeted, ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"" This didn't stop Trump from continuing to attack Khan via Twitter on Monday. To sum it all up: Trump responded to a terror attack in the capital of America's greatest ally by attacking its mayor, pulling something he said completely out of context, and doubling down when he was called out for being wrong. So, instead of addressing violence within his own borders, Trump went out of his way to berate the leader of a city that was just attacked. In the UK, handguns are banned and gun laws are strict, which saves lives. If the London attackers had firearms, it's conceivable they would've killed far more people. Given all this, it's understandable why people are praising Ariana Grande, while condemning Trump's behavior. He's arguably writing the book on how not to respond to terrorism.",2017-06-05 14:50:08,People Think Ariana Grande Is Better At Responding To Terrorism Than Trump,,70102,http://elitedaily.com/#spider

As the deputy press secretary went off on CNN and the media for what she called a “constant barrage of fake news directed at this president,” Karem interrupted her for a little light reading of the riot act. “Come on!” Karem fumed. “You’re inflaming everybody, right here, right now with those words. This administration has done that as well. Why in the name of heavens any one of us are replaceable, and any one of us, if we don’t get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel, or not read us.

Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country. On the other side of the spectrum, there's also a chance we may look back one day in an effort to decode the origins of a propaganda tactic that's continued to be manipulated by powerful and/or misinformed ne'er do wells. Either way, there's no doubt we can learn from the false stories that started it all.

One of the immediate critics is a mother whose daughter was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, a massacre that Jones has dismissed as a government hoax. Nelba Marquez-Greene saw the interview, scheduled to air Sunday - Father's Day - as an ""egregious offense"" to fathers whose children were murdered on Dec. 14, 2012, in Newtown, Connecticut. ""To give Alex Jones a platform on Father's Day is especially cruel to me,"" she told The Washington Post. Jones' interview reignites a debate over whether interviewing polarizing figures on national television gives them a platform or places their controversial views under scrutiny. A call to Kelly's publicist was not returned, but in a tweet responding to criticisms Sunday night, the host said the media needed to ""shine a light"" on who Jones is, particularly because of the layer of legitimacy he's receiving from the White House. Infowars was given a temporary press credential last month. President Donald Trump, who has appeared on Infowars, once called Jones a ""nice guy"" and hinted that their mind-sets align. Marquez-Greene said Kelly's reasoning is misguided and would, instead, encourage Jones' army of followers to ""double down"" on their effort to label the massacre of 20 elementary schoolchildren a hoax. ""Shining a light works on cockroaches,"" she said. ""It doesn't work on Alex Jones."" She added: ""It's just a reminder that we really haven't found a way as a nation to really honor the loss. We really want to honor the loss, but we really don't know how to do that. Because this is not the way."" Efforts to reach Jones on Monday were unsuccessful. A message left to Infowars' media hotline was not returned. Marquez-Greene took to Twitter after she found out about the upcoming interview. She posted a picture of her daughter Saturday night and tagged Kelly in a tweet: ""Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Marquez-Greene. Say her name - stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook,"" she wrote. Marquez-Greene said her concerns weren't necessarily over Jones, but on ""the people he inspires."" Just last week, a Florida woman who claimed the mass shooting was a hoax and sent death threats to a parent whose 6-year-old son was killed, was sentenced to five months in prison. Marquez-Greene said her family frequently receives mails from hoaxers implying that the shooting is a government conspiracy, suggesting that actors had been involved and accusing them of making millions off an Obama hoax. Others tell her she should teach her son how to shoot. Marquez-Green said she found that most disturbing. Marquez-Greene's son was 8 when his sister, 6-year-old Ana Grace, was killed. She said she's tried to keep the now-12-year-old boy away from social media, where he might learn of the conspiracy theories swirling around his sister's death. ""It's hard enough to deal with losing a sister in mass shooting. We are trying to protect him as much as we can,"" she said. ""He lives in a world where people don't think his sister's death is real. I'm not ready for him to know that yet."" In a preview of the interview, Kelly asked about the Sandy Hook massacre and his conspiracy theory that the shooting was a government hoax to push for tougher gun laws. In answering the question, Jones seems to offer differing views. ""Well, Sandy Hook's complex because I've had debates where we devil's advocates say the whole story's true,"" he said. ""And then I've had debates where I've said none of it's true."" Kelly then went on to confront Jones, who seemed to move the conversation to other topics that he said the media failed to cover. Kelly: When you say parents faked their children's death, people get angry. Jones: Oh, I know. But they don't get angry about the half a million dead Iraqis from the sanctions. They don't get angry about all the - Kelly: That's a dodge. Jones: No, no, it's not a dodge. The media never covers all the evil wars that's promoted - Kelly: That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown. You know it. Jones: Here's the difference. I looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made statements long before the media even picked up on it. We didn't really get into the really important stuff. Kelly: What do you mean? We talked about all the important stuff. Jones: Here's the big one they always make fun of me. You probably want to throw this in there. Thirty years ago, they began creating animal-human hybrids. Isn't that the big story that Megyn Kelly should be doing? For Marquez-Greene, if Jones deserves a platform on national media, so do parents like her. ""If they're going to do the interview, fine,"" she said. ""But then give us equal airtime to express how dismaying this is."" She also said she wants to talk to Kelly, off or on the air, ""mother to mother, woman to woman."" ""And just talk about the personal impact this has had on our family and many others,"" she said. The Jones interview is Kelly's second since NBC launched her ""Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly"" last week. Her first interview was with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Few details were available about the shooting in the 3300 block of West Douglas Boulevard about 3:15 a.m., where police canvassed a green space dividing the road. They laid down more than 30 evidence markers. One man waiting outside the hospital said his 17-year-old son was shot in the leg. Another man said a 24-year-old relative was undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to the side. Chicago police officers guarded three vehicles parked near the entrance, one with a bullet hole in the back window, apparently used by the victims to drive themselves to the hospital, according to preliminary information from a law enforcement source. The nine people injured in the Lawndale shooting were among 33 people shot from Saturday to Sunday morning, including two men shot on the Riverwalk near North Dearborn Street and West Wacker Drive in the Loop. All of the 9 people shot have had their conditions stabilized, according to police. Two 17-year-old boys, a 35-year-old man, a 29-year-old man, a 23-year-old man, a 30-year-old man were all taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. A 22-year-old man and a 33-year-old woman were taken to Stroger Hospital and a 26-year-old man was taken to Rush Oak Park hospital. Of the shooting victims citywide, three men were killed. In the most recent homicide, 24-year-old Dontae Thomas, was shot in the abdomen in the Lawndale neighborhood just before 5:10 a.m. Sunday. Thomas was standing in the street in the 1400 block of South Avers Avenue when someone drove by in a white sedan and fired shots. Thomas, of the 3700 block of West Wrigthwood Avenue in Chicago, was taken to Stroger Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 a.m, according to the medical examiner's office. Just before 1:30 a.m., a 29-year-old man identified as Fredrick Vasquez was fatally shot in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, according to police and the medical examiner's office. Vasquez was standing on the sidewalk in the 1000 block of North Monticello Avenue when someone inside a gray sedan fired shots at him. Vasquez was taken to Norwegian American Hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest and pronounced dead at 2:04 a.m., according to police and the medical examiner's office. A 19-year-old man identified as Ivan Gutierrez, was pronounced dead on the scene after a drive-by shooting in Back of the Yards just before 3:15 a.m. Sunday, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office. Earlier, police said the dead man was 20. Gutierrez was standing in the street with two other people, who were also shot, in the 5300 block of South Seeley Avenue. A 33-year-old man was shot in the body and taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where his condition was stabilized. A 22-year-old man was shot in the body and taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday for Gutierrez, who lived in the 5300 block of South Seeley Avenue, according to the medical examiner's office. Shooting on the Riverwalk A 30-year-old man and a 28-year-old man were shot on the Riverwalk just before 2:05 a.m. Sunday. The victims were arguing with other men when the situation escalated into gunfire, police said. The shooting appeared to be related to a fight about a woman, and ""not a random act,'' according to Chicago police. The older man was shot in the left foot and the younger in the right leg. Both men were taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where their conditions were stabilized. A blood-soaked sock rested on the northeast corner of Dearborn Street and Wacker Drive inside yellow crime scene tape. Police closed the entrance from that corner to the Riverwalk and a portion of it underneath. Blood smears could be seen on the pavement below from the Dearborn Street Bridge. The Chicago police marine unit also responded to the Riverwalk, and a diver searched deep in the water. ""Did you see him throw a gun in there?"" an officer asked a man who said he heard the shots. The man said he did not because he was on the other side of the bridge. One of the men involved in the shooting ran into the Renaissance hotel, which is across the street on Wacker, according to preliminary information from a law enforcement source. Detectives continue to investigate and are making good progress reviewing surveillance video, police said.

176,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nicole-lovell-murder-smartphone-predator-stranger-danger-killer-app/,"""48 Hours"" investigates the murder of Nicole Lovell,13, and the hidden dangers of connecting online with strangers Produced by Josh Yager [This story first aired on Sept. 24, 2016. It was updated on June 3, 2017.] BLACKSBURG, Va. -- ""Every morning … I come out here, sit with her for an hour,"" Tammy Weeks said while visiting her daughter's grave. ""It's just been a nightmare … I still hope that she would come around the corner when she gets off the bus … or she'll come out of her room,"" Weeks said in tears. The nightmare for Nicole Lovell's mother began on the morning of Jan. 27, 2016. ""I pushed the door open, and the nightstand was up against the door,"" Weeks told ""48 Hours"" correspondent Peter Van Sant. ""That night … I was gonna knock on the wall and tell her to come in … and sleep with me like she usually does … and I didn't do it,"" she said tearfully. Sometime in the middle of the night, the 13-year-old had climbed out of her bedroom window taking along her phone and her favorite blue cartoon blanket. ""Did you call her cell phone?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Oh yeah, a bunch of times,"" she replied. ""And what would happen?"" ""It'd go -- straight to voicemail.  I text-messaged her, everybody was calling her.  Texting her,"" said Weeks. Weeks called police and began scouring the area. Before long, a neighborhood mother gave her some chilling news. ""Nicole had been playing with her … daughters and said that Nicole had said she was goin' out on a date,"" said Weeks. Like millions of teens, Nicole spent a lot of her social time online. So Weeks feared she might have left to see someone she'd met on the internet. ""You must be a bit panicked at this point?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah,"" she replied. Local News Report: The FBI has now joined regional and state law enforcement in the search.  This afternoon they canvassed from neighborhood… Nicole's disappearance also sent shockwaves through her hometown of Blacksburg, Virginia, the scene of that infamous 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. Blacksburg Police press conference:  This community is known for stepping up and we need them to do that at this time as we pray for the return of a beautiful young girl. By midday, Blacksburg was stepping up again. WDBJ News report: More than 1,200 searchers are on a mission to find the 13-year-old. Volunteers even brought an infrared drone to aid in the search for Nicole. ""I know she wouldn't go nowhere for that many hours without her medicine,"" said Weeks. Nicole was born with a damaged liver and needed a transplant before her first birthday. Now a teenager, she still needed her anti-rejection medication every day to survive.  Her illness and surgical treatment had left Nicole with scars on her stomach and neck. Weeks says Nicole had emotional scars as well. ""So she was being bullied?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. She hated going to school,"" Weeks replied. ""She would always make me write her a note for gym because they would pick on her about her scar."" Nicole's social media posts reveal a sadly typical teenage story: so lonely she'd had suicidal thoughts, longing for love and convinced nobody cared about her. Weeks says Nicole not only had trouble fitting in, she also had a difficult relationship with her father, David Lovell. He did prison time on a drug charge and he's had other problems with the law. ""She wanted his attention,"" Weeks said. ""She wanted his love."" ""I have regrets that I wasn't there. I feel … you know, what did I do wrong, why wasn't I there for her more often,"" said Lovell. He'd left Tammy before Nicole was born. The two were never married. ""When you would go to work, was there anyone supervising her?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""Yeah, my parents,"" she replied. ""Your parents, did they live at the house?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes."" ""So she never went unsupervised?"" ""No,"" said Weeks. But Nicole was leading an unsupervised life online through the social media apps on her smartphone. ""It's like a loaded gun,"" said Pamela Casey, a district attorney in Blount County, Ala., who is on a national crusade warning people about the dangers of social media. ""This is the new crime of our time,"" she said. Pamela Casey PSA: If you pick up your child's phone and you don't know the password, that's a problem.  If you don't know… Casey began speaking out long before Nicole Lovell disappeared in Virginia. Her online safety videos have been seen by millions across the country. Pamela Casey PSA: I can actually go live on Periscope and post updates to you guys… if I can do that live sitting in my office, then your child can do that live in their bedroom. ""Years ago, you had to worry about your kid getting snatched.  Parents don't realize that essentially your kid could get snatched -- their life taken by somebody they meet in their own bedroom,"" said Casey. By late on the day Nicole Lovell vanished, her parents' hope was fading with the winter light. ""I didn't sleep at all that night, I waited…"" said Weeks. But it would be three days before Nicole's parents had to face the horrifying news that her body had been found. ""Your whole world just comes tumbling down,"" Weeks cried, ""because she was my everything."" ""Coley had a passion for pandas, music, dancing ... Nicole touched many people throughout her short life,"" Weeks said at a press conference the day she got the news, referring to Nicole by her nickname. Weeks was quickly was overcome by emotion and left the podium. Shock and sadness were everywhere, but investigators had gotten a big break. And it came from Nicole Lovell herself. She'd left behind virtual evidence of a real-life murder. Nicole's dad, David Lovell, says even before her body was found, investigators had found a solid lead -- she had handwritten the usernames and passwords to all her accounts on her bedroom wall. FBI computer forensics experts traced Nicole's account information and quickly established that she'd regularly used Kik – a popular chat app attractive to teens, in part, because they can communicate anonymously without their parents knowing. ""When you had her phone, did you ever click on the Kik app just to see what was inside?"" Van Sant asked Weeks. ""No,"" she replied.""I just made her delete it, uninstall it."" ""Do you believe she reinstalled it? ""Yeah,"" said Weeks. So the FBI put in what they call an emergency disclosure request to Kik. They wanted to see Nicole's personal account, and they make a startling discovery.  It turns out that in the last two days of her life, she'd been messaging with a person who had a chilling username: ""Dr_Tombstone."" Using an IP address provided by Kik, investigators traced the Dr_Tombstone screen name to David Eisenhauser, 18, a freshman engineering student at Virginia Tech. David Eisenhauer seemed the last person in the world capable of killing a 13-year-old girl.  He'd been a high school track star. Former classmate Dorothy Callahan says his brains and charisma were as strong as his strides. ""He was a very celebrated student, he always had straight A's,"" Callahan said. ""And he was sort of cocky, and he was like, 'Yeah I'm David Eisenhauer, I was just on the local news. I'm a big deal.'"" Three days after Nicole went missing, Eisenhauer was picked up by police at his dorm and taken in for questioning. His roommate, Jeremy Basdeo, walked in on the startling aftermath. ""I went to my room and I saw the door open,"" he said. ""And I got turned around by the Virginia State Police and the FBI."" ""And what did they say?"" Van Sant asked. ""They said, 'Don't worry.  It's not about you.  It's about your roommate,'"" he replied. Basdeo told ""48 Hours"" that Eisenhauer's behavior the night Nicole Lovell vanished was really odd. ""He put on boots. But it wasn't raining that hard for boots. But, you know, I just let it go. And then -- he came back at 2:00 in the morning,"" Basdeo continued. ""Did you ever see a knife in the room?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""He usually leaves[s] it on his desk."" ""Was it on his desk when the cops showed up?"" Van Sant asked. ""No. They couldn't find it,"" said Basdeo. Eisenhauer soon admitted to police he'd talked to Nicole outside her house that night. He was arrested and charged with abduction. Eisenhauer's statements led them to another young woman, Natalie Keepers. She was brought in for questioning, too. What did 19-year-old Natalie Keepers know about what happened to Nicole Lovell? Keepers -- another Virginia Tech freshman and another unlikely person of interest. ""She wanted to study engineering and be like her father who worked for NASA,"" Mark Jenkins, a former boyfriend, told ""48 Hours."" Investigators strongly suspected Keepers was involved.  She too was arrested. With  two people in custody, police made a grisly discovery. Nicole Lovell's nude body was located 90 miles away in North Carolina. ""What kind of wounds were on her body?"" Van Sant asked Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson. ""She was stabbed… her throat was cut,"" he replied. ""…and then the thoughts turn to, 'who are the animals who could have done something like this to her?'"" District Attorney Pamela Casey said Eisenhauer and Keepers may represent a new kind of predator. ""Sometimes it's usually the people we least expect,"" Casey warned. ""They could be your next door neighbor,"" she said. ""…they can stay behind their phone and hide behind their phone -- just like your child is doin'."" Casey said criminals often use apps like Kik. Why? Because it's where kids hang out online. In fact, Kik -- a Canadian company -- claims that millions of American teens use their app every month. ""You can be anybody…"" said a convicted predator we'll call ""Steve."" He should know. ""Steve,"" 38, said he used the Internet to groom kids and spent 10 years in prison for molestation. He told ""48 Hours"" he now feels a new urge to sound the alarm about anonymous chat apps like Kik. ""Kik … is a predator's paradise,"" he said. ""Pedophiles, do they go on Kik, pose as a 13, 14, 15-year-old in order to hopefully strike up a relationship with a child?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yes, that's quite common on there,"" ""Steve"" replied. ""Steve"" demonstrated just how easy it is for an adult to use the Kik app to begin a conversation with a child. We created -- and later deleted -- a Kik account for the demonstration. ""Steve"" showed how us how the app could be used to target children. ""My message is: 'I'm sad and lonely,'"" said ""Steve"". After hitting send, it took just 44 seconds for the first response to arrive.  Another girl, apparently a teenager, responded less than three minutes later. ""In two days max, I could have her sending me nude pictures,"" ""Steve"" said. ""Once you make 'em happy, you got their heart, once you got their heart, everything else follows."" Three months had passed since Nicole Lovell's murder. With David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers still behind bars, investigators had discovered text messages that led them to the door of Bryce Dustin. ""I almost felt like he was like a little brother, Dustin said of Eisenhauer. It was on a gaming site that Dustin first chatted with Eisenhauer. And though they never met in person, they began a six-year-long internet friendship. ""David, you know, kept coming back to me for advice on everything,"" said Dustin. ""What kind of problems would he ask you for advice about?"" Van Sant asked. ""Girls was a big one,"" Dustin replied. Dustin told ""48 Hours"" he remembers Eisenhauer talking last winter about a problem he had with one girl in particular, a girl Dustin now believes was Nicole Lovell. ""He told me that he had found out she was underage and that … she wanted to be with him. And that she was going to expose him if he wasn't with her,"" he recalled. He said Eisenhauer was worried about being outed in a relationship with an underage girl. So he offered some big brother kind of advice. ""If she wants to be your girlfriend, you know, let her, but don't be the greatest boyfriend, just like don't text her, just ignore her,"" Dustin advised. ""…she'll go away."" Another family was about to have one of their daughters go away as well -- in the car of an online predator in Spokane, Washington. ""Her last moments, is what flashes through my mind. That's my nightmare,"" said Nicole's father, David Lovell. Lovell says he wishes he had done better in protecting Nicole. ""If it can happen to my family, it can happen to anybody. I mean, flat out anybody,"" he said. It can happen to any family, including one in Spokane, Washington, about 2,500 miles away from Virginia. The parents here got a tip that their 15-year-old daughter was being targeted by a 30-year-old man. And what's worse? The two were planning to run away that very night. ""She was gonna leave her iPad, hop in the car … with a man she doesn't really even know,"" said Detective Elise Robertson. It was June 7, 2013, when Detective Robertson of the Spokane Police Department's Special Victims Unit got the kind of call cops all over the country have come to expect. ""A father was saying that his daughter was having an Internet relationship with a 30-year-old man and he had just found out…"" she said. ""And that's when everything broke loose,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Until that moment, Brandy, and her husband, Branden Syrotchen, seemed to have the quintessential American family. She, teaching at a local church, he studying for a PhD in Psychology. They'd been hands-on parents, raising their sons, Joshua and Josiah, and daughters Ariel and Elizabeth. They shared a love of God, country, sports and each other. ""My parents were pretty strict,"" said Elizabeth Syrotchen. Elizabeth, now over 18, says it wasn't always easy reconciling her upbringing with a growing lust for life. ""I felt like my parents were holding me back from what the average kid gets to experience,"" she said. ""And how much did your parents monitor your life?"" Van Sant asked. ""I would say that they thought that they were monitoring me … they didn't understand that they actually weren't monitoring me,"" she explained. ""They probably had no clue about Kik and those dating sites."" But her parents did become suspicious when Elizabeth, then 15, suddenly started acting strangely. ""She would be going to bed earlier than normal,"" her father said. Elizabeth seemed distracted -- less interested in family activities, in church, and even in friends.  Her parents took her smartphone away and asked to see her social media accounts. She refused. ""At that point you're like, 'OK, something's really wrong here,'"" said Brandy Syrotchen. They were stunned to learn just how wrong.  It all started with a phone call from Elizabeth's best friend's mother … a call that turned their world upside down. ""Elizabeth is dating a 30-year-old …And he plans on coming down and … getting her at 3 o'clock in the morning,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""That very day?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah. And we're like, ""W—what???"" Brandy replied. Elizabeth was angry and evasive, but her parents finally got her passwords and soon discovered the truth. She had been communicating with a stranger: a 30-year-old Seattle-area man named Jason. ""Jason Richards says, 'When I see you, baby, I am grabbing you. Pulling you close to me. And holding you tightly,'"" Brandy Syrotchen tearfully read aloud from her daughter's correspondence with the man. ""And what does Elizabeth say?"" Van Sant asked. ""'No kiss?' And Jason says, 'Baby, I'm gonna kiss you deeply,'"" Brandy continued. ""This guy's evil. She's fooled. She's lured in,"" said Branden Syrotchen. The communications show that initially, Elizabeth told Jason she was 18, but later admitted her real age: 15.  The Syrotchens were stunned to learn that the pair had already met in person and been intimate. They were even discussing leaving the country. The two had used apps including Facebook and Kik. ""This is playing out in some ways like your own personal family horror film,"" Van Sant commented to Elizabeth's parents. ""Yeah,"" they replied. The horror continued as the Syrotchens realized that within hours, Jason would be driving the 280 miles from Seattle to Spokane to pick up their daughter. They locked Elizabeth in her room with no phone or Internet access and called police. ""'This guy wants to kidnap my daughter tonight. He's planning to kidnap my daughter tonight,'"" said Branden Syrotchen. ""Were your hands kind of tied?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""What do you do at that moment? You have a 15-year-old girl who's your only witness who's denying everything,"" the detective said. Detective Robertson says that without hard evidence of an actual crime, police had to stay on the sidelines. ""So there's nothing they can do for you?"" Van Sant asked the Syrotchens. ""There's absolutely nothing they can do for me,"" Branden replied. ""And when you hear that you feel totally helpless. And it's, like, 'OK, well, what are you gonna do now?'"" said Brandy. What they did was hatch their own plan to turn the tables on the man who was about to lure their daughter away. ""This is my daughter and nobody's gonna mess with her and nobody's gonna get her.  And I'm gonna do what it takes,"" said Brandy. Jason had already messaged from the car. ""I needed to communicate with him to get him to our house,"" Brandy explained. Gritting her teeth, Brandy Syrotchen went online -- impersonating her own daughter. ""For seven hours, I sat there and listened to him, 'Oh baby I can't wait to see you … I can't wait to get you in my arms …lay in the same bed together, wake up in the morning,'"" she said in tears. ""And for seven hours I communicated back, 'Oh baby, I love you too …I can't wait.'"" ""In the pit of your stomach that must have made you …"" Van Sant began. ""It made me sick!"" she said. ""Jason is getting ever closer to your house, ever closer to your daughter,"" Van Sant noted. Standing in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, Branden told Van Sant, ""My wife was up there and she was on the iPad."" ""She's communicating with him. Posing as your daughter,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Exactly. Yes"" Branden recalled that Brandy kept the conversation with Jason Richards going, in the alley behind the Syrotchen's house, he and his friends had set up a sting operation like something out of an action movie. As Branden waited in his car on one side of the alley getting updates from his wife on the phone, his friend, Damon, waited in his car on the other side of the street. ""So the idea is like a pincer, right, you're gonna trap.  It's like a bear trap that's gonna close,"" said Van Sant. ""Yes,"" Branden affirmed. Branden's friend, Phil, brought his 12-gauge shotgun. He'd been trained in Special Forces and had no idea how Jason would react. It was 3 a.m. in Spokane, Washington, but could just as easily been high noon. As Branden Syrotchen and his team lay in wait, headlights appeared at one end of the alley.  A 30-year-old man's sexual road trip to take a 15-year-old girl from her family was about to come to a shocking end. ""He pulls in. At this time, we go ahead and we call Damon down here. And Damon-- just books it,"" Branden explained. ""I'm pulling in here … Jason pulls in right there."" Branden's friend, Phil, quickly approached the vehicle, shotgun raised. ""I said …'Driver … Put your hands on the steering wheel. Do not move or I will shoot you. …Couple of times he moved his hands and I said, 'What part of do not move do you not understand?'"" Phil demonstrated. ""If Jason makes some sort of move, are you prepared to pull that trigger?"" Van Sant asked. ""If he exited the car abruptly, I would've shot him,"" Phil replied. They called police, who arrived minutes later and arrested Jason. In his SUV, they found cell phones and a pair of hunting knives. They would later discover he also owned a handgun. ""He was caught but it wasn't over,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. Ninety minutes later, Jason came face-to-face with Spokane Det. Elise Robertson in a videotaped interrogation: Det. Robertson: So Jason, tell me a little bit about yourself. Jason Richards: I work for Royal Cup Coffee. Detective Robertson learned Jason was actually Jason Richards, a 30-year-old, divorced coffee distributer from the Seattle area. Like David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers in the Lovell case, Jason Richards seemed nice and successful on the surface. ""Who is this guy?"" Van Sant asked the detective. ""Jason is the guy next door,"" she replied. He tried to turn his crime into a love story: Jason Richards: I pretty much fell for her very quickly … we said ""I love you"" pretty quickly, about a week and a half into really talking with each other. At first, Richards insisted he had no idea Elizabeth was only 15 until a policeman told him at the time of his arrest. Jason Richards: He told me that she wasn't 18. Det. Robertson: OK. Jason Richards: I responded, ""Come again?"" And I'm like, ""She's, no she's 18."" ""He was lying, the whole time he was lying. The whole time, over, and over, and over, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie,"" Det. Robertson told Van Sant. To see if her instincts were right, Detective Robertson asked to see Richards' Facebook page. There were literally hundreds of exchanges between him and Elizabeth. ""And I start looking at it and I realize, 'Oh, he knew, he knew before he ever came over here she was 15,'"" Det. Robertson remembered. ""I looked right at him and I said … 'So are you gonna tell me the truth now?"" Det. Robertson: Wanna tell me the truth now? Jason Richards: I fell in love with her. And I didn't know what to do. Det. Robertson: And she told you that she was 15 and still in school? Jason Richards: Eventually. Det. Robertson: Right. Elizabeth told her parents she was going jogging, but instead came to a parking lot near her house. ""This is our first meeting spot,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant at the lot. ""When you actually saw him face-to-face, what did you think?"" he asked. ""'Holy crap,' like, I think it became a reality to me that it's not just somebody that I'm talking to over the Internet!"" she replied. Elizabeth says Jason took her to a hotel, got down on one knee and proposed marriage -- and then they got in bed.  In the following weeks, he came to town again. ""On those visits you did have sex with him each time?"" Van Sant asked. ""Yeah, we did,"" Elizabeth replied. ""For you, Jason is what?"" Van Sant asked Det. Robertson. ""He's a sexual predator,"" she replied. Jason Richards: I've completely just f----d up my life. ""My life was destroyed,"" said Elizabeth. The events of that chaotic day still seem to haunt the Syrotchens, too. ""This hits you right now like a punch across the face,"" Van Sant commented to Branden. ""It's just absolutely unbelievable,"" he replied in tears. ""This guy found out that she was a minor and that's --and then after that's when he decided to sleep with her,"" Branden continued. Richards pleaded guilty to child rape and communication with a minor for immoral purposes.  His lawyer argued Richards has autism, which can be a mitigating factor for several crimes in Washington State. He got a light sentence: three years. ""When you learned that Jason was in jail?"" Van San ""It broke me,"" Elizabeth told Van Sant. Inexperienced at love, Elizabeth says her online connection with Jason had been instant. ""Everything progresses faster online because you're just more comfortable,"" she explained. ""...you don't have to talk to that person in person."" District Attorney Pamela Casey says far too many internet predators are turning to apps like Kik, and their alleged crimes are making headlines across the U.S.—more crimes than Facebook and Instagram users combined. In May, disgraced ex-N.Y. congressman Anthony Weiner pleaded guilty to a federal obscenity charge for sexting with a 15-year-old girl, using social media believed to include Kik. Back in Spokane, Van Sant asked Elizabeth, ""Did you fall in love with Jason?"" ""Yeah, I did,"" she replied. ""I hate to say it, but part of me still loves him."" But Elizabeth didn't really have the whole story about Jason Richards. In fact, she may not have been his one true love. On Richards' phone, Det. Robertson had discovered graphic photos of young women and men. ""What's your reaction to all that?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. Stunned, and in tears, she stood up and left the interview room. About 10 minutes later, she returned. ""Do you want to say anything?"" Van Sant asked Elizabeth. ""I just feel so fooled. Like, for three years I've been defending him and it's not right, it's not right,"" she replied. Seeing some of Jason's graphic photo collection for herself drives home the point. ""That's a lot of pictures though, of a lot of different women …oh…and a man,"" she said looking at the photos on a computer. ""Honestly, if anything, it makes me feel better. …It's going to be easier for me to move on."" Looking back, Elizabeth's mother, Brandy Syrotchen, says she wishes the judge had given Jason Richards as much as life in prison. But back in Virginia, Nicole Lovell's mother says there is no punishment severe enough for the accused predators. ""I want both of 'em to suffer,"" said Tammy Weeks. And she says Eisenhauer and Keepers aren't the only ones who should have to answer for her daughter's murder.  She blames Kik, too. ""They need to shut Kik down,"" she said. ""It's just disgusting."" Kik is now a billion-dollar company and the CEO declined ""48 Hours""' request for an on-camera interview. ""It's ironic when the head of a social media company won't talk to us, so we're heading off to a technology conference in Brooklyn, New York, in hopes of catching up, with the CEO of Kik,"" said Van Sant. Evidence suggests Nicole Lovell was lured to her death over the Kik chat app – one of the same apps Elizabeth Syrotchen used to communicate with the man who almost lured her away. As Kik's CEO Ted Livingston left the stage at the conference, ""48 Hours"" found him … on his smartphone. ""Mr. Livingston, Peter Van Sant, how are you?"" Van Sant said. ""With CBS News … I just want to ask you a quick question … What personal responsibility do you have to make sure that children are safe who use the Kik app?"" ""Yeah, I think I have a huge responsibility,"" Livingston replied. ""I'm sure you're familiar with Nicole Lovell, a 13-year-old girl in Virginia,"" Van Sant continued. ""What would you say to Nicole's parents?"" ""Like, when we heard about that case, that hit the office. That hit me super hard, like, it's just, like, hard to hear about something and I grew up with a brother with disabilities..."" said Livingston. Like many social media companies, Kik posts an online guide for parents and, in a statement, told ""48 Hours"" the company cooperates with law enforcement. Ted Livingston claims his app is as safe as the competition. ""I think it's no different than Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. You know, you have bad people going -- "" he said. ""As a parent, I disagree. I can check my child's Facebook account and Twitter account, I friend them. But with Kik I can't,"" Van Sant pointed out. ""Yeah, I think that's no different than Instagram. You have a private mode. You can have private messaging, all that exists there,"" Livingston replied. That's true, but Kik's design is attracting millions of teens, in part, because many believe its parentproof -- the best app to keep their social lives secret. Sadly, predators also can keep secrets on Kik. ""Kids are going to use a messenger. If we were to shut down Kik tomorrow, there'll be 10 right behind it,"" said Livingston. Back in Spokane, Elizabeth Syrotchen is still struggling to make sense of what happened to her.  Things with her parents are still tough … mostly because, at 18, she met a new boyfriend at the gym. He was 35. ""Would I like to see some things change?  Of course,"" said Brandy Syrotchen. ""We'd all love to see that,"" Branden Syrotchen added. ""You have to compromise. You can't just be your way or the highway,"" Elizabeth told her father on camera. Jason Richards got out of prison in May, and the case against him is closed. But in Blacksburg, Virginia, Nicole Lovell's murder case has yet to be resolved. At a joint hearing for David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers, no cameras were allowed inside as police presented new details of Nicole's murder -- details they say were provided by Keepers herself. News report: Investigators testified Eisenhauer covered Lovell's mouth and cut her throat.  Keepers later helped Eisenhauer load Lovell's body into his car, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. A detective testified that Keepers admitted to helping Eisenhauer plan the murder and then dispose of Nicole's body. And that Keepers was excited to be part of something secretive. News report: She said he was a sociopath and she was ""a sociopath in training."" It's all too much for Nicole's mom, Tammy Weeks, who comes to court, but can't force herself to sit through the day. ""I didn't know he had stripped her naked and poured bleach on her,"" she said. There is no evidence that Nicole was sexually assaulted, though Eisenhauer is formally charged with first-degree murder and abduction -- Keepers as an accessory to murder. Both also are charged with transporting or concealing a dead body. Eisenhauer has reportedly told investigators, ""I believe the truth can set me free."" ""Is there any doubt who is responsible for the death of your daughter?"" Van Sant asked David Lovell, Nicole's father. ""No,"" he declared. Eisenhauer's former internet buddy, Bryce Dustin, doesn't have much doubt either, especially after a final exchange he had with Eisenhauer around the time Nicole disappeared. ""I without a doubt believe that he did it,"" said Dustin. ""He texted me and said, you know, 'The original plan's failed.'  And he was like, he's like, 'Do you know where I can hide a body?'"" Dustin continued. At the time, Dustin thought Eisenhauer was kidding.  He, along with so many in the shell-shocked community of Blacksburg, still want to know how two intelligent college kids with their lives in front of them might wind up involved in taking the life of a 13-year-old girl. ""I wish he would've done it to me instead of her,"" Weeks cried. ""I would trade places with her in a heartbeat. 'Cause she deserved to live."" Nicole Lovell's death is a dark reminder of how social media has profoundly changed society. ""I hope … everybody learns from this.  Hold their kids tight. 'Cause it can happen to you,"" said Weeks. Today, our children have a host of new ways to live… and new ways to die as well. David Eisenhauer is scheduled to be tried in November 2017.  Natalie Keepers is scheduled to be tried in February 2018 . If convicted, both could face life in prison with no parole.

It happened Wednesday morning. The quiet camaraderie of Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game against their Democratic colleagues was shattered by rifle shots from one James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill. Police officers providing security returned fire. When the shooting was done, five people were wounded, including two officers and Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., whose injuries were critical. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old left-winger and former supporter of Bernie Sanders who was apparently motivated by hatred for Donald Trump and the GOP, was mortally wounded. There was still blood on the ground when conservatives began laying the shooting at liberals’ feet. Rep. Chris Collins, N.Y., blamed “outrageous” Democratic rhetoric. (He later expressed regret for that comment.) The Infowars website cited a “hysterical anti-Trump narrative.” Radio host Michael Savage spoke of a “constant drumbeat of hatred.” It was predictable because it’s what we always do. Jerry Falwell blamed the ACLU for 9/11. Jane Fonda blamed Sarah Palin for the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. At some point, you’d think we’d learn that rhetoric — excluding that which explicitly or implicitly calls for violence — does not “cause” people to shoot, stab, or bomb. By that logic, you’d have to blame Fox “News” and other organs of the right for the Planned Parenthood shooting and the Atlanta Olympics bombing. It makes about as much sense. You know who’s to blame for this shooting? James Hodgkinson is. Frankly, this sudden concern for the tenor of political discourse feels precious, even sanctimonious, given conservatives’ history of invective and lies. Where was all this fretting last year when Donald Trump said “Second Amendment people” might stop Hillary Clinton? Where was it week before last, when Eric Trump said Democrats are “not even people” to him? The bottom line is that a president of unprecedented incompetence is being enabled by a Congress of criminal complicity in an agenda of frightful destructiveness. To see that and not say it loudly and emphatically would be an act of journalistic, political or civic malpractice. It would be un-American. Not that liberals have any reason to feel smug about this. Taken in conjunction with a recent string of attacks on police officers, Wednesday’s shooting suggests something as startling as it is troubling. Namely, that left-wing terrorism might be making a comeback. It has been 40 years since the likes of the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Weathermen disappeared from view, and in those years domestic terrorism has been exclusively a phenomenon of the political right. That may be changing now. It’s a deeply disturbing idea, suggesting as it does a nation ever faster pulling itself apart, a people riven by irreconcilable differences, a country that isn’t even sure it wants to be a country anymore. These tired games of political one-upmanship are too small for such a moment. This moment is for soul-searching, for considering who and what and even if we are, as Americans. It is for wondering what it means when baseball is not safe and being a Republican gets you shot. Nothing less than our national identity and ideals are at stake here.

178,http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/brandon-woman-sentenced-to-5-years-in-jail-in-sandy-hook-parent-threat-case/2326533,"FORT LAUDERDALE — A Brandon woman pleaded guilty and was sent to prison Wednesday for threatening a man whose 6-year-old son was killed in the 2012 mass shooting at a Connecticut school, which she contended was a hoax. Senior U.S. District Judge James Cohn sentenced Lucy Richards, 57, to five months in prison, followed by five months of home detention. She pleaded guilty to interstate transmission of a threat to injure in communications with Lenny Pozner, the father of Noah Pozner, who died in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Cohn called Richards' actions toward Pozner ""disturbing"" and said no one should cite a conspiracy theory or belief in a hoax in the deaths of 20 children and six adults that occurred at the school. ""I'm sure he wishes this was false and he could embrace Noah, hear Noah's heartbeat and hear Noah say 'I love you, Dad',"" Cohn told Richards. ""Your words were cruel and insensitive. This is reality and there is no fiction. There are no alternative facts."" Investigators say Richards made four voicemail and email threats to Pozner on Jan. 10, 2016, after viewing internet sites claiming the shooting was a hoax aimed at curtailing Americans' Second Amendment gun ownership rights. The messages said things such as ""you gonna die, death is coming to you real soon"" and ""LOOK BEHIND YOU IT IS DEATH."" Richards, seated in a wheelchair at the hearing, has significant mental health problems including agoraphobia — fear of leaving one's house — obsessive compulsive disorder and anxiety disorder, court documents show. But Cohn said he did not think mental illness triggered Richards' actions. ""You have the absolute right to think and believe as you so desire,"" the judge said. ""You do not have the right to transmit threats to another."" RELATED: Sandy Hook father bemoans 'the darkness' as feds charge woman with threatening him In a statement before she was sentenced, Richards apologized and said she could not account for her actions against Pozner that day. ""I don't know where my heart and head were that day, but they were not in the right place,"" she said. ""It was the worst mistake of my life and I am truly sorry."" Others linked to the Sandy Hook massacre have reported harassment by hoax believers amid a growing trend of ""fake news"" stories and baseless conspiracy theories, such as the ""Pizzagate"" case in which a man fired an assault rifle inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria after going there to investigate unfounded claims it harbored a child sex abuse ring. In fact, Richards' public defender Robert Berube said he had gotten calls from around the United States from people who think Sandy Hook was a hoax. ""There were many people who told me it never took place,"" he said. In addition to the prison time and home arrest, Richards will serve three years on probation and is barred from accessing a list of conspiracy theory websites. She had initially been scheduled to plead guilty in March but did not show up in court, leading to her arrest April 1 and time in jail since then. Those two months already served will count toward her five-month prison sentence.",2017-06-07 17:03:33,Brandon woman sentenced to 5 years in jail in Sandy Hook parent threat case,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/

""Come out with your hands up, or you will die,"" an officer shouts to the gunman in one of the videos. In other clips, officers can be heard describing the massive loss of life and the search for survivors. ""Who still has gloves so we can check this one's pulse, did anyone check this one?"" an officer asks.  A few seconds later, another officers says: ""I got no pulse."" ""This is going to be astronomical numbers,"" an officer says. In another clip, ""We probably got about 20 gunshot victims, we're going to need a lot of people."" The Orange County Sheriff’s Office and Orlando Police responded to the June 12 mass shooting, which was carried out by Omar Mateen and left 49 dead and dozens injured. In speaking with crisis negotiation officials, Mateen, 29, called himself an “Islamic soldier.” He was killed after three-hour confrontation with law enforcement officials. More coverage: Three horrific hours: Inside the Orlando nightclub massacre Pulse nightclub's shooter alternately emotionless, frenzied FBI Director James Comey provided more details about Mateen in June saying he was apparently radicalized, at least in part through online websites.

On one occasion, Comey said co-workers were concerned after Mateen told them he hoped police would raid his apartment and assault his family ""so he could martyr himself."" Comey said Mateen admitted making some of the comments but said he was lashing out at co-workers who bullied him because of his Muslim background.

John McCain, filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times on Tuesday, saying the paper falsely accused her of inciting the near-fatal shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for defaming her by publishing a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011,” the lawsuit obtained by TheWrap states. Palin’s lawsuit alleges that the Times June 14 editorial “falsely” reported that she “incited Jared Loughner’s Jan. 8, 2011, shooting rampage” in Arizona where Loughner shot 19 people, including the severely wounded Democratic congresswoman Giffords.

The lawsuit also claims that the Times editorial board ignored news reports by its own reporters as well as staff columnists that stated that there was no link between Loughner and the Palin PAC mailings, and that Loughner acted because he was severely mentally ill.

View In Gallery Between Lindsay Lohan firing back at Fox News, Mariah Carey allegedly short changing her domestic help, and Sly Stone winning millions after suing his ex-manager -- stars often turn to the courts to address their squabbles and strife. Lindsay Lohan filed suit against Fox News and Sean Hannity on Feb. 2, 2015, after a news correspondent accused Lohan's mom of snorting cocaine with her troubled daughter. It didn't take long for Fox to fire back. “We will defend this case to the fullest,” the network told TheWrap the next day. A former nanny for Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon filed a lawsuit on Jan. 28, 2015, alleging she was fired after showing the couple's kids too much affection and did not receive overtime pay despite working 100 hours per week. Legendary funk artist Sly Stone won $5 million on Jan. 27, 2015, after suing his former manager and entertainment attorney for misappropriating royalties owed him for more than 20 years. “Real Housewives of Miami” veteran Joanna Krupa slapped “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Brandi Glanville with a slander lawsuit on Jan. 22, 2015, after Glanville allegedly accused Krupa of sleeping with a married man and c Former “Real Housewives of Orange County” executive producers Patrick Moses and Kevin Kaufman filed a suit against Bravo in Nov. 2014, claiming they were deceitfully ousted from the show and bilked out of millions of dollars after helping to create the show and the franchise. Jessie Nizewitz, a contestant on VH1’s “Dating Naked,” filed suit in New York in Aug. 2014, seeking $10 million in damages for emotional distress, humiliation and embarrassment after the show allegedly failed to properly blur her genitals. Octavia Spencer was awarded $940,000 in Dec. 2014 after claiming a weight loss company, Sensa Products Inc., wrongfully fired her from an endorsement deal and still owed her money. Former Tinder executive Whitney Wolfe filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former company June 2014, alleging she was repeatedly called a ""whore"" by CMO Justin Mateen and was stripped of her co-founder title simply for being a woman. Former TMZ producer Jarrett Gaeta slapped his former employer with a lawsuit in June 2014, claiming he was wrongly terminated. Gaeta was let go after a subordinate accused him of ""racist behavior,"" including defending blackface and sending pictures of watermelons to African-American employees. CNN America was sued in Aug. 2014 by a pair of plaintiffs who claim that correspondent Arwa Damon bit one of them and threatened both during a drunken altercation at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

A judge later dismissed the case for lack of sufficient evidence. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West filed suit against YouTube founder Chad Hurley on Oct. 31, 2013, claiming he posted a video of the couple’s surprise engagement to his website without permission. The process was delayed when Hurley’s reps filed an anti-SLAPP motion in an attempt to have the case dismissed. Jahmel Binion filed a lawsuit against Shaquille O’Neal in July 2014 when O’Neal posted a photo to his Instagram account mocking Binion, who suffers from a rare condition that causes facial abnormalities, sparse hair and missing teeth. Binion claimed defamation, emotional distress and invasion of privacy in the $25,000 lawsuit, and after pressure from the public O’Neal apologized. In 2014 singer Chris Brown was mentioned in a lawsuit filed by the cousin of artist Frank Ocean. The defendant claimed Brown and an associate allegedly kicked and punched him when he confronted them about parking in a spot designated for Ocean at a Los Angeles recording studio.

The incident reportedly occurred in Myrtle Beach early Sunday after a fight broke out among several men, one of whom pulled a gun and opened fire. Seven people were reportedly hospitalized as a result of the event. “If you’re watching this, stay away from Fourth Avenue North and Ocean Boulevard,” Bubba Hinson, who  captured the video, said during the Facebook Live stream. “There’s multiple people been shot!” The video, which has since gone viral and is still available on the site, had well over 4 million views on Facebook as of Tuesday evening. Read: Man Dies After Setting Himself On Fire On Facebook Live In View Of Ex-Girlfriend In response to the incident, a Facebook spokesperson told International Business Times in a statement that the company “has long been a place where people share their experiences and raise awareness about important issues.” “Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and graphic images of public interest or concern,” the statement said. “In many instances, when people share this type of content, they are condemning it or raising awareness about it. However, when they are shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence, we remove them.” Facebook told IBT that the video has been flagged and marked as “disturbing.” Facebook says that it considers the context in which violent or graphic images are shared before deciding how to move forward. The site notes that when any such content is shared to condemn or raise awareness about a particular event or topic, Facebook may mark it as disturbing — as was the decision in Hinson’s case. When a video is marked as disturbing, the content is visible only to users who are 18 and older and the platform does not allow autoplay. Users must actually click on the video to make it play.

The  News and Observer reported Sunday that police responded to Fifth Avenue North and Ocean Boulevard at roughly 12:25 a.m. local time to break up a crowd that had gathered. A fight reportedly occurred between several men nearby, at which point one of the individuals reportedly pulled out a gun and opened fire. According to  Myrtle Beach Online, the shooter fired multiple rounds before fleeing the scene by carjacking a vehicle; he was apprehended “within a few hours” of the incident. The site reported Sunday that local police planned to make his identity public once an arrest warrant was served. Seven people, including the shooter, were hospitalized with injuries that were not life-threatening. “No officers were shot or injured as a result of this incident,” Police Lt. Joey Crosby said in a statement Sunday. “The security officer did receive a graze wound to the leg. The injury did not require him to be transported to the hospital and he received medical attention on scene.” According to the News and Observer, Hinson is a volunteer firefighter who was visiting the resort town for the SC Fire-Rescue Convention. Hinson told the paper that he began streaming the crowd because he “thought they were dancing.” He added, “Then, they started fighting. Then, they started shooting.” “I always wanted a viral video,” Hinson told the News and Observer, “but I never wanted it to be like this.” A man inadvertently captured a mass shooting live on Facebook this week after a traffic stall turned deadly in South Carolina in June.

186,http://feeds.chicagotribune.com/~r/chicagotribune/offtopic/~3/28NZ3t5dLHI/ct-orlando-workplace-shooting-20170605-story.html,"ORLANDO, FLA. — A man who was fired from a Florida awning factory in April returned Monday with a semi-automatic pistol and methodically killed five people, then took his own life at the sound of an approaching siren, authorities said. Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings identified the shooter as John Robert Neumann Jr., a 45-year-old Army veteran who lived alone and did not appear to belong to any type of subversive or terrorist organization. The shooting began after Neumann slipped through a rear door into the cavernous Fiamma Inc. factory, an area larger than two football fields where awnings are stitched together for recreational vehicles. He paused at least once to reload. ""My experience tells me that this individual made deliberate thought to do what he did today. He had a plan of action,"" said the sheriff, who wouldn't say why Neumann was fired. The gunman ""had a negative relationship with"" at least one of the victims. ""He was certainly singling out the individuals he shot,"" Demings said, adding that most victims were shot in the head. Some were shot multiple times. State and federal law enforcement officers converged on the industrial park in Orlando shortly after 8 a.m. after a woman ran out and called 911 from a tile business across the street, said Yamaris Gomez, that store's owner. ""All she kept saying was he was holding a gun and told her to get out,"" Gomez said. That woman had been hired after Neumann was fired in April, so he probably did not recognize her and knew she was not a former co-worker, Deming said. Searching for a motive, deputies cordoned off a trailer park in Maitland, where Neumann lived alone in a mobile home on a busy road next to a funeral home, a used car lot and a dog-grooming business. Like the awning factory, it's far from Orlando's famous theme parks. Deming said investigators also are looking through any social media postings for clues. Neumann was honorably discharged in 1999 and did not have a concealed weapons permit, the sheriff said. Arnie Boyd, who lives in the same trailer park, said Neumann was not particularly social. ""Every once in a while, he would ride his bike around and that's it,"" Boyd said. ""We would speak only once in a while."" The dead were identified as Robert Snyder, 69; Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44; Kevin Clark, 53; Jeffrey Roberts, 57; and Kevin Lawson, 46. Authorities had confronted Neumann once before at the factory, when he was accused of battering a co-worker in June 2014. But no charges were filed, and that co-worker was not among Monday's victims, the sheriff said. In a 2014 incident report, Neumann's co-worker said Neumann punched him in the back of the head when he approached, knocking him to the ground. But the co-worker later changed his story, saying that Neumann had chased him and then hit him on the back of the head. Neumann had a record of minor crimes, none violent, dating back nearly 20 years. Most involved traffic violations — driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, giving a deputy a false name and leaving the scene of a hit-and-run involving property damage. Fiamma calls itself one of the largest manufacturers of awnings for camper vans, motor coaches and sport utility vehicles. Shelley Adams said her sister, Sheila McIntyre, called her from the company's bathroom during the shooting and kept repeating, ""My boss is dead. My boss is dead."" Officers arrived two minutes after being dispatched, the sheriff said. The FBI also responded, said Ron Hopper, who runs the FBI's Orlando office. And while five people were killed, ""seven others' lives were saved due to the quick actions of the officers who arrived on the scene today,"" said Special Agent Danny Banks of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Authorities had no reports of any specific threats the gunman made to people at the company or anyone else, but that's why people need to alert authorities whenever they learn of anything that could lead to violence, Banks said. ""If people see something that seems abnormal, they need to say something,"" Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs added. The latest government statistics indicate that fatal workplace shootings have ticked upward in the United States. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show a 2 percent rise between 2014 and 2015 to 417 cases. Among those, fatal shootings rose more sharply, by 15 percent. Sen. Bill Nelson called for more action to address mental health issues. He noted that next Monday will mark a year since the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The attack at the Pulse club killed 49 people and wounded dozens more. ""The city of Orlando, which is still healing from the Pulse massacre, has seen too much violence this past year,"" the Florida Democrat said in a statement. Republican Gov. Rick Scott asked ""all Floridians to pray for the families impacted by this senseless act of violence."" Associated Press Writer Freida Frisaro in Miami contributed to this report.

Steve King, a Republican from Iowa, recently blamed activism by the left for creating the environment leading to the shooting off House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana.Rep. King owes us an apology, and maybe a gun.The right paints the left as opposing second amendment rights. But it makes little sense the left's supposed agenda would parlay itself into this violent assault.Further, I'm a so-called liberal, and I no longer have a problem with guns. The 154 mass shooting this year (so far) have led me to believe guns should be carried everywhere at all times. The GOP and the NRA have convinced me it's too late for those of us who are civilized.The only solution that will satisfy the GOP and the gun lobby is a federal program to arm every U.S. citizen with a gun, with open- and concealed-carry permitted everywhere -- no exceptions.As the GOP and the NRA argue so successfully, our Founding Fathers made us free, but only Samuel Colt could make us equal.

Orlando's LGBTQ community created a campaign called #HonorThemWithAction in recognition of the one year mark of the Pulse massacre. Through the campaign, the LGBTQ community is mobilizing to complete 49 days of action, with each day of activism commemorating a victim of the shooting. Over the next seven weeks, the campaign's daily actions will cover topics related to LGBTQ equality and gun control. The June 12 action, for instance, is to attend a Pulse remembrance event in your community or watch one online. The daily action on June 16 is to contact your member of Congress and demand they sign on to the Disarm Hate Act. ""We must ensure the lasting memorial is the real change of uprooting anti-LGBTQ hatred, discrimination, and violence in our culture,"" the campaign website reads. The campaign was started on June 12, the one year mark of the Pulse Nightclub shooting that took place on Latin night. A single gunman murdered LGBTQ Latinx people almost exclusively in the horrific shooting, which is recognized as the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. The effort is already being supported major nonprofits working with the LGBTQ community, including GLAAD, GLSEN, Lambda Legal, Human Rights Campaign, National Center for Transgender Equality, National LGBTQ Task Force, and SAGE. These partner organizations not only are tweeting their support under the hashtag, but are also pledging to take part in the 49 days of action. Aside from the daily actions over seven weeks, the campaign is also encouraging individual supporters to use the hashtag #HonorThemWithAction on social media to share how they are helping to tackle LGBTQ bias and bigotry in their everyday lives. Examples given by the campaign including coming out to family, questioning workplace and school policies toward LGBTQ people, and volunteering with queer-focused organizations. Through this dedicated action, the queer community is moving forward with resilience to honor those taken one year ago. It's another vital step toward continued healing. More in

A rally is scheduled for Chicago, while in Frankfort, Ill., a village roughly 60 miles southwest of the city in Will County, a rally and march are planned. ""Mobilizing LGBTQ+ communities, our loved ones and our allies — with particular focus on those who have been actively silenced and neglected — in the fight to affirm and protect our rights, our safety and our full humanity,"" is the goal of the Washington march, according to the event website. (Use of the + sign is one way individuals and groups are signaling awareness that there are a number of communities included under the LGBTQ umbrella besides lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer.) The marches and rallies also will feature observances of the first-year anniversary of the June 12, 2016, attack on Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, where a gunman killed 49 people, the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Chicago Equality Rally will take place at 11 a.m. Sunday during the popular Andersonville Midsommarfest at the intersection of North Clark Street and West Balmoral Avenue. It is being billed as ""a gathering of celebration, solidarity and mobilization to affirm and protect all members of the LGBTQ community's rights, safety, and full humanity."" ""Speakers and performers will promote visibility, unity and pride,"" according to a news release from the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce, which is co-hosting the event. Fawzia Mirza, an actor, writer and producer, is slated to be emcee at the rally, which will feature remarks from leaders of organizations active in the LGBTQ community, performances and appearances by elected officials. Andersonville Midsommarfest will also donate $1 from each gate donation Sunday to three organizations, Equality Illinois, Center on Halsted and Ava's Change4Youth, according to the news release. Meanwhile, in Frankfort, a group called Southwest Suburban Activists is sponsoring a rally, march and performance, beginning at 2 p.m. Sunday at Breidert Green Park. The group began with the inauguration of Donald Trump as president, according to a news release, and members have ""worked together to bring tolerance, empathy and solidarity to the Frankfort area."" The group held a Women's March on International Women's Day, a vigil for Syrian refugees and a Nasty Woman Art Exhibit in Kankakee, Ill. The group predicts Sunday's Equality March will be the biggest event yet, with a turnout of 250 people expected. ""The Federal Government is turning their back on the LGBTQ+ community and the Southwest Suburban Activists will not stand for it,"" the group said in the news release. ""This event is an opportunity to show support for the LGBTQ+ community and also to reach out to the youth in the area who may be feeling uncertain about where they stand in our current political climate. We demand equality for all."" ""We are thrilled to be a part of this global movement,"" said organizer Emily Biegel. ""Frankfurt was chosen because I live here, and it is my most fervent goal to make our community more inclusive."" Biegel said the rally and march are ways to ""show pride in our community, show pride in the LGBT community."" After the rally, there will be a march in downtown Frankfort. Details are available on the group's Facebook page. The marches and rallies occur on the eve of the one-year mark since the tragic shooting at Pulse nightclub, and ""aim to honor the victims and uplift the resilience of the Orlando LGBTQ+ community,"" according to the Washington march's website. Chicago's rally will include a moment of silence for the Pulse anniversary, said Joelle Scillia, Andersonville Chamber of Commerce marketing director. A separate event Monday marking the Pulse shooting is being planned by Center on Halsted, Chicago's LGBTQ center. This community vigil service is called ""Pulse: One Year Later"" and will take place 6-7 p.m. outside the center at 3656 N. Halsted St. A candlelight vigil will include speeches, performance and the tolling of a bell for each of the 49 victims, according to the center's news release. The Frankfort rally, Biegel said, also will include a ""remembrance or acknowledgment"" of the first anniversary of the Pulse attack.

201,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2017/06/jason_dalton_appeal_1.html," Gallery: Judge rules on submission of mass murder's statements KALAMAZOO, MI -- An appellate attorney for accused Kalamazoo mass shooter Jason Dalton is asking the Michigan Court of Appeals to consider blocking Dalton's statements to police from being admitted at trial. Kalamazoo County Circuit Court Judge Alexander C. Lipsey on May 24 denied a defense motion to suppress some of Dalton's statements to police following a shooting during which he allegedly killed six people and injured two. Lipsey stayed proceedings at the request of Dalton's defense attorney, Eusebio Solis, until the appeal process is finished. Dalton's appellate attorney, Anastase Markou, on June 14 filed an application with the state appeals court asking it to hear the appeal. In the court documents, Markou says Lipsey erred in denying Dalton's motion to suppress statements he made to a Michigan State Police detective at the Kalamazoo County Jail. He argues that Dalton's waiver of his rights to an attorney and his right to remain silent weren't constitutionally valid. Markou also argues that the trial judge's ruling that the public safety exception to the Miranda rule permitted Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety detectives to ask limited questions about unknown victims shouldn't apply in this case. Markou said in the application that the issues he is asking the Court of Appeals to address ""are fundamental to whether Mr. Dalton can put forth a reasonable defense"" at trial. Dalton, an Uber driver, is accused of going on a shooting rampage the night of Feb. 20, 2016 at three locations in Kalamazoo County, killing Judy Brown, Barbara Hawthorne, Mary Jo Nye, Mary Lou Nye, Rich Smith and Tyler Smith, and injuring Tiana Carruthers and Abigail Kopf. Dalton, 46, of Cooper Township, faces six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight felony firearm counts. He was found competent to stand trial in April and in May was ordered to stand trial. Solis has filed a notice of intent to use an insanity defense. Lipsey ruled April 20 that the entirety of an interview Dalton had with a Michigan State Police detective will be allowed at trial, but only portions of an interview he had in the early morning of Feb. 21, 2016 with Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety detectives will be allowed. Solis argued at a hearing that detectives violated Dalton's constitutional rights in two separate interviews following the shootings. Dalton told detectives 25 times he didn't want to speak, according to Solis. Kalamazoo County Assistant Prosecutor Jeff Wiliams argued, meanwhile, that the goal of the KDPS interview wasn't to get evidence against Dalton, but rather to learn of the threat of public safety, which is an exception to the Miranda rule. Williams also argued Dalton initially invoked his Fifth Amendment rights when being interviewed by Michigan State Police Detective Kyle Gorham, but later initiated a conversation about the investigation and waived his rights. Police reports about the interviews were included in information released by police in 2016 as part of Freedom of Information Act requests. According to the reports, Dalton told KDPS Detective Bill Moorian, who interviewed him with KDPS Detective Cory Ghiringhelli, that his explanation for the shootings would blow their minds. ""Dalton then explains how when he opens up the Uber taxi app a symbol appeared and he recognized that symbol as the Eastern Star symbol,"" Moorian wrote. ""Dalton acknowledged that he recognized the Uber symbol as being that of the Eastern Star and a devil head popped up on his screen and when he pressed the button on the app, that is when all the problems started."" Gorham wrote in his report that Dalton said he hadn't been sleeping well because the Uber app wouldn't let him ""shut down."" According to Gorham's report, Dalton also talked about how he received a message on his phone to ""plug in an auxiliary cable into his car, along with the power source for his phone and a Bluetooth."" On Feb. 20 he said he was asked to take an assignment from Uber and when he got into his car he began driving really fast, the report says, and ""advised something had come into his car."" Dalton, the report says, claimed the Uber app communicated to him with ""dings,"" with one meaning yes, and two meaning no. He also told the sergeant things ""began to get really weird"" and he ""freaked out"" after symbols popped up on his Uber app asking him to join, which he agreed to do. Dalton told Gorham the Uber app on his iPhone was to blame, claiming the app took over his Chevrolet Equinox - and later his body - and said ""things began to get really weird"" in the hours before the shootings. The Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office has 21 days to respond to Markou's appeal application. Once the Court of Appeals has both the application and response, it will decide whether to hear the case.

204,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/357939736/0/phoenix/nation~Pulse-shooting-Florida-strengthens-oversight-on-securityrelated-licenses/,"ST. LUCIE COUNTY, Fla. — Since the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando, the state has taken steps to increase oversight of people with the same type of security-related licenses held by the gunman, Omar Mateen, a Florida official said. Mateen had a security officer license and a statewide firearms license, according to Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services records. He was properly licensed for the job he held. Mateen worked for the large security firm G4S. More than 50,000 people in the United States and Canada work for G4S, and are involved with providing security for entities including governments, ports, airports, nuclear plants and residential communities. The security officer license Mateen held at the time of the shooting, known as a class ""D"" license, was required for anyone who ""performs the services of a security officer,"" according to the state agency's website. Related: A year after Pulse nightclub shooting, a legacy of healing Column: One year later at Pulse, love wins Pulse nightclub shooter's mosque targeted in year since rampage Holders of the license are allowed to ""bear a firearm"" if they also have the statewide firearms license, known as a “G” license. Mateen had that also. According to Jenn Meale, communications director for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the department enhanced oversight of the class “D” and “G” licenses. She said they include accessing real-time data from a Mental Competency, or MECOM, database that is overseen by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Clerks of Court must submit to the database records including those of involuntary substance abuse assessment and stabilization; involuntary substance abuse treatment; involuntary inpatient treatment and acquittal of a criminal offense by reason of insanity, according to FDLE documentation referenced by Meale. The records have to be submitted within a month. Meale said her agency gets daily updates of those holding “G” licenses who have information submitted to the MECOM database. “Once we receive that information, we can take action to suspend the license,” Meale said via email. Meale also said her agency started keeping fingerprints of ""G"" license holders in January. She said when a license holder “commits a forcible felony or a crime with a firearm, we are notified within 24 to 48 hours once the individual is charged and fingerprinted.” Such arrests result in a license suspension. As part of his statewide firearm license application, Mateen had a written psychological test or evaluation in 2007. Other information from the license file shows Mateen completed firearms proficiency requirements. However, Meale said G4S was fined more than $150,000 for paperwork mistakes involving psychological evaluations. The mistakes don't invalidate the results. “G4S erroneously submitted psychological evaluations that had a psychologist's name on them who was not currently conducting those evaluations,” Meale said. “While we have every reason to believe that evaluations were conducted, the investigation revealed that approximately 1,500 of the psychological evaluations had the wrong psychologist’s information on them.” Will Greenlee writes for The Stuart (Fla.)

205,http://variety.com/2017/tv/columns/megyn-kelly-alex-jones-interview-sunday-night-nb-1202469971/,"Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Variety Print Plus Subscriber Kelly isn't a pushover, and proves that Jones is newsworthy because of his connections to President Trump. But that's it By 
	Sonia Saraiya TV Critic Megyn Kelly’s interview with Alex Jones was much less interesting than the conversation that led up to the broadcast. The past week has been a tumultuous one for NBC News’ new star. Kelly is attempting to make an impression with NBC’s audience this summer in advance of the September debut of her 9 a.m. morning show. Jones, the founder and chief mouthpiece of the Infowars radio program and online channel, is an unstable right-wing provocateur who may be most notorious for his steadfast insistence that the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting was a hoax. His attention-getting assertion has convinced enough others that the bereaved parents have received death threats from angry Infowars viewers. This, in turn, has so horrified many Americans that Jones’ appearance on “Sunday Night” prompted outcry: In addition to a heated conversation about the role of journalism and freedom of speech, JP Morgan Chase withdrew its advertising, and the NBC-owned station in Connecticut opted not to broadcast the interview. Jones, in response, took matters into his own hands — distancing himself from the interview and leaking his recording of one of his conversations with Kelly.  Entirely on its own — aside from Jones’ prevarication, the chummy behind-the-scenes photos of Jones and Kelly that surfaced, the multiple third-party opinions on the topic, and the leaked audio — “Sunday Night’s” segment on Jones is mostly notable for how empty it is. The interview portion, where Kelly is actually sitting opposite Jones, is minimal — perhaps just a few minutes of footage when pieced all together. Being a good television interviewer requires not just the courage of presenting interviewees with uncomfortable facts — courage that, to her credit, Kelly has in spades — but also the ability to establish a rapport with the subject in order to engage in conversation. Jones is a disjointed personality who sees the world as an interlocking set of media-fueled conspiracy theories; trying to have a fact-based conversation with him on any one topic is nearly impossible. Certainly Kelly was not especially skilled at it. Which made it all the more perplexing that she thought Jones would be a good subject for her new show. The one strong takeaway from the entire segment was that Jones is newsworthy and dangerous because he has the ear of our volatile president. The segment starts with that sentiment, and then proceeds to enumerate various situations in which Jones is a concerning public figure (including an interview with Neil Heslin, who lost his son in the Sandy Hook tragedy). Then it ends. To be sure, Kelly is right to observe that the connection is worth investigating. But the “Sunday Night” segment doesn’t seem like investigating; it’s instead a wind-up to a punch with no subsequent impact. “Sunday Night” could have focused on the sources of Jones’ Sandy Hook theories, or Jones’ connection to Trump, or Jones’ popularity within certain circles. It could have tried to profile Jones to discover more about his pot-stirring rhetoric — or enumerate the instances in which he is connected to Donald Trump. Those are angles. This segment doesn’t have an angle. It doesn’t have an iota of new information about Jones. Instead it ticks off the existing controversies that surround him, and then hits a wall. Kelly does not manage to make the segment into a story because she has no story.  Because of the advance backlash, it seems likely that the segment was edited to indicate as firmly as possible Kelly’s condemnation of Jones’ outrageous statements. That may explain why the interview portion that aired seems so stilted; the exchanges that aired emphasize Kelly trying to get him to disavow his past statements. They appeared to be carefully extracted out of broader conversation. The decision to go after Jones actually put the spotlight on the fact that Kelly, despite the reputation she built at Fox News, is not a great interviewer. She also struggled during her much-hyped sit-down with Russian President Vladimir Putin on “Sunday Night’s” debut a few weeks ago. Her talent is less about extracting information from intriguing people and more attuned to leading the audience to a sense of vague unease about her subjects. As evidenced by the segment that immediately followed Jones’ — a pearl-clutching take on the phenomenon of (legal) delivery services for (legal) marijuana — Kelly’s primary mode is manufacturing and expressing concern, without much thought as to where that concern comes from and why it matters. That reluctance to dig deeper is what doomed the Jones segment. It is hard to not feel that Kelly has just emboldened Jones — an ideologue who will use any angle to advance his pernicious narrative. For all the build-up, the segment ultimately revealed more about Kelly’s weaknesses as an anchor in the “60 Minutes” mold than it did about Jones.

206,http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/the-carmichael-show-shooting-episode-pulled-alexandria-1201842498/,"Michael Schneider Jun 14, 2017 9:15 pm @franklinavenue “The Carmichael Show” Chris Haston/NBC UPDATED THURSDAY: “The Carmichael Show” star Jerrod Carmichael taped an episode of Netflix’s “Chelsea” on Wednesday, right as NBC was deciding whether to air that night’s episode of his topical sitcom – and he expressed disappointment that it wouldn’t run. “NBC wants to pull the episode,” he told host Chelsea Handler. “I understand a corporation wanting to make that decision. But for me that says you don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations. Something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims. We handle the episode with as much love and respect as we possibly could. But to just pull the episode is just criminal. It seems to do a disservice to the viewer. We’re having what I hope is a conversation about that.”  NBC ulimately decided to push the episode of “The Carmichael Show,” which deals with a mass shooting incident, in light of Wednesday’s shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., as well as an incident in San Francisco.  The episode, “Shoot-Up-Able,” may air later in the season, but NBC was not available for comment. The episode centers on Jerrod (Jerrod Carmichael), who returns home after witnessing a mass shooting at a shopping mall. According to the listing, “he fights against being coddled by his family and being labeled a victim, but things are made harder when he’s forced to tell a police officer exactly what he saw.” Later in the episode, Jerrod admits that he may be suffering from post-traumatic stress. “I thought that tonight’s episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way,” Carmichael said on “Chelsea.” “A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say, ‘too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately these things happen constantly. “The episode itself is about me, the character surviving a mass shooting and coming to the conclusion that even though he wasn’t physically harmed he is still very much a victim. We are all victims when something like this happens. We all suffer from fear, fear of going out, the pain of knowing that families have lost loved ones.” Instead of that episode, NBC will air the episode “Lesbian Wedding,” which was originally scheduled for June 28. READ MORE: ‘The Carmichael Show’: How A Live Audience Taught the NBC Comedy What It Couldn’t Say About Oprah The timing of “Shoot-Up-Able” was obviously coincidental, as the episode was taped months ago. But it’s a reminder that “The Carmichael Show” has earned critical praise for its willingness to tackle hot-button subjects such as guns, in a smart way that mixes humor with honest emotion and dramatic moments.  NBC’s decision is common in the wake of news like what happened in Alexandria; after past shootings, networks have pre-empted episodes of shows such as “Family Guy.” Last year, USA delayed the launch of “Shooter” due to a sniper in Dallas. At the time of the “Shooter” delay, some pundits noted that shootings have become so common in the United States that networks may have to constantly pre-empt shows. Speaking of timeliness, next week’s episode, “Cynthia’s Birthday,” focuses on the use of the “n” word, in this case by a white character. The debate comes, again coincidentally, soon after the controversy surrounding Bill Maher’s use of the word on HBO. As IndieWire’s Steve Greene recently noted in his Season 3 review of the show, “Even when tackling these heavy issues — the new season starts out with frank discussions of rape, patriotism and assisted suicide — ‘The Carmichael Show’ mines its best moments of comedy from two people or two opposing sides of a family acknowledging the perspective gap they have between them. And though the show frequently divides various family members along gender or age lines, ‘The Carmichael Show’ has never set up an easy, formulaic us vs. them pattern where the audience can easily predict where everyone will stand.” READ MORE: ‘The Carmichael Show’ Review: TV’s Boldest Sitcom Is Funnier Than Ever, Even In A Season 3 Filled with Deep Questions “The Carmichael Show’s” prescient ability to discuss headlines as they seemingly happen brings to mind other shows that have faced similar situations, such as “Homeland.” Coincidentally, “Shoot-Up-Able” even features a character singing a song from “Dear Evan Hansen,” which coincidentally would have aired just days after it won the Tony Award for Best Musical.

207,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/14/gop-lawmakers-call-on-members-of-congress-to-arm-themselves-following-baseball-practice-shooting/,"The oft-cited Republican talking point following a mass shooting is usually the same, despite being riddled with flaws: It's fine that people are gunning others down — at rates that no other country comes close to touching — but I better have a gun on me when it happens. On Wednesday after the tragic shooting at a GOP Congressional baseball practice Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., blamed the ""tone"" of his Democratic colleagues for the attack -- before calling on his fellow Republican lawmakers to arm themselves. ""I can only hope that the Democrats do tone down the rhetoric,"" Collins said on WBEN, a Buffalo radio station. ""The rhetoric has been outrageous – the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump, his supporters. Really, then, you know, some people react to things like that. They get angry as well. And then you fuel the fires,"" he added. Collins then pledged to carry his gun with him from now on. ""On a rare occasion I'd have my gun in the glove box or something, but it's going to be in my pocket from this day forward,"" he said. Collins' GOP colleague, Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk complained that if the attack “had happened in Georgia, [the shooter] wouldn’t have gotten too far.” Loudermilk told CNN that he had a staffer with him who “back in Georgia carries a 9 mm in his car,” adding “he had a clear shot at him, but here we’re not allowed to carry any weapons."" Loudermilk took aim at Washington DC’s strict gun laws -- even though the shooting occurred in Virginia, where gun regulations are lax. ""Most of us are here in D.C., so how are you supposed to have it here?"" he asked. ""This is exactly why there's a lot of fear of doing town halls at this point."" Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, who applied first aid to Scalise after he was shot, was also quick to take up for lax gun restrictions on Wednesday. Though his response was generally well measured, he still believes the common sentiment on the Left is to abolish all gun rights. But having a serious conversation about guns doesn't mean that people are attempting to repeal the Second Amendment, it just means that a sensible regulation of firearms should be enacted with the intent being to increase public safety. Of course, the common right-wing ideology is that more guns in the hands of more people will not only act as a deterrent to prevent mass shootings but that it will also be easier for citizens to quickly act on — and stop a shooting — when one occurs. But does that not liken the potential for a ""wild wild west"" saloon-style shootout? Wednesday's assailant, James T. Hodgkinson, had a valid firearm license, according to NBC's Tom Winter. But he also had a criminal history, including being charged with domestic battery in an incident with a woman. In fact, one could argue that Hodgkinson's criminal history should have prevented him from legally owning and possessing firearm. NBC reported: Hodgkinson, a licensed home inspector who ran his business out of his Illinois home, has a history of arrests and was charged in 2006 with assaulting a woman, according to public records. At the time, police recovered a pocket knife, hair they say was pulled out of the woman's head, and a 12-gauge shotgun at the scene of the alleged attack. The charges, domestic battery, aggravated discharge of a firearm, and battery, were later dismissed, according to public records. But this is seldom discussed in the realm of American politics.

Episodes of Jerrod Carmichael’s sitcom have discussed everything from gun control to the N-word. Wednesday night, the show had planned to air a new episode, “Shoot Up-able,” in which Carmichael’s character survives a mass shooting and discusses the aftermath with his family. Given the multiple shootings that happened during the day Wednesday, NBC ultimately decided to pull the episode and air a different one, “Lesbian Wedding,” in its place. Carmichael did not agree with this decision. Appearing on Chelsea to discuss the episode, Carmichael explained he thought the episode “would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way and really lend itself to conversation.” He explained that Americans mostly avoid confronting these hard issues, which is why it’s important to open a place for such conversations, even in the wake of real-life pain. “A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say ‘too soon,'” Carmichael said. “But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately, these things happen constantly and it’s a thing that breaks all of our hearts … I understand a corporation making that decision, but really, to me, what it says is you don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims,” Carmichael said. “We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we could.

After her friend writes about her sexual assault on social media, Maxine (Amber Stevens West) debates her boyfriend, Jerrod (Jerrod Carmichael) — and other family members — on the issue of consent, which thoroughly freaks out Jerrod’s brother, Bobby (Lil Rel Howery), who’s recovering from a hazy drunken hook-up the night before. “The line of consent is such a topic on college campuses — in the world in general,” says Carmichael, who co-created the series. “What consent means is evolving, and rightfully so. We’re trying to curb any problems and any tragic events from happening. But when we talk about where that line is — when we talk about how it’s evolved and hearing a verbal ‘yes’ — guys realized that what it is on paper and what it is in an actual situation where you’re with a young lady or a young guy, a lot of times they don’t match up. We wanted to write an episode around the confusion, the not knowing, the ignorance. Bobby says, ‘Oh wait — by your definition, then I’ve made a huge mistake.’ It’s an episode around the evolving definition of consent.” He hopes that the episode, titled “Yes Means Yes,” will provoke discussion while helping to clear up uncertainty in an arena in which there should be none. “We wanted to contribute a little bit more clarity of not only the definition, but men and women’s feelings around the matter because it is such a delicate thing,” he notes. “Like anything we talk about, we want to handle it with care. We are aware that there are far too many victims of sexual assault every single day, and we just wanted to have a very specific conversation about it. It’s women talking about their fears and men talking about their fears — and it’s the things that we feel enlightened or ignorant on.” The episode even contains a brief discussion about Donald Trump, as Maxine tells Jerrod at one point that “a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women and then dismissed it as locker room talk was elected as President of the United States. Clearly, we don’t take it seriously enough.” Carmichael notes that the mentions of Trump were carefully reviewed by the network. “People were really cautious because we don’t want to say anything that’s not true about anyone — and you can’t, it becomes a legal issue at some point,” he says. “I think we kind of teed it on the line. I think we ultimately got to the honesty of it.” The second episode of the night, titled “Support the Troops,” centers on Jerrod getting in a fight with someone he knows who serves in the armed forces, prompting Joe (David Alan Grier) to try to smooth things over with the soldier. This leads to friction between father and son about what it means to be patriotic and Carmichael’s favorite line in the episode, which is Joe’s attempt to explain why the U.S. went into Iraq: “He’s like, ‘Don’t go into the we-invaded-Iraq-over-a lie nonsense. I told you why we went: Iraq has oil. The terrorists were trying to do bad stuff with that oil so we had to go there, fight them, get the oil, return to freedom, mission accomplished.’” Other installments this season don’t take their foot off the peddle — or rather, their fingers off the hot-button issues. Another episode likely to raise eyebrows and chatter is “Cynthia’s Birthday” in which Jerrod is called the n-word by a white friend. “The family has a discussion about who should say it, who shouldn’t say it, the pain around it, how it affects us, the benefit of trying to stop someone from saying it,” he says. “It’s a full discussion about that. And we say ‘n—–‘ six times.” Was that a tough sell to NBC? And how exactly did he arrive at that number? “They agreed to once, and [co-creator Ari Katcher and I] went off to write it,” he says. “Our showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzel was like, ‘All right, let’s try to keep it at two,’ because she knew I was going to write it more than once. We wrote it four times — and we ended up saying it six times in the episode.” Speaking of pushing boundaries, next Wednesday’s installment, “Grandma Francis,” will seek comedy in a deadly serious topic, exploring assisted suicide after Jerrod’s grandmother (Marla Gibbs), who suffers from Alzheimer’s, decides that she’s going to take her own life. “It shouldn’t make me laugh, but it’s one of our funniest episodes, actually, and Marla Gibbs is just brilliant in it,” he says. “It’s a tricky situation: Should you stay around for your loved ones? Is the value of your life based on just how you feel about yourself or how others feel about you? If she’s no longer herself and, as she says in the episode, she’s losing who she is, what’s the value of her staying? Those types of questions are really begged in the episode. It’s one of our favorite ones.” There’s also an episode that deals with the emotional fallout of a mass shooting at the mall (“The family tries to get Jerrod to talk about his feelings about it,” he hints), another one that examines African-American literacy, and one in which Maxine tries to set up Bobby with a friend who the family considers unattractive. “It’s an episode about body image, and how society treats attractive people, and how people view themselves,” he says of the latter. “Is your worth rooted in how you look?” In sum, season 3 looks to be the show’s best yet, according to Carmichael. “Everything that the characters talk about feels honest to them,” he notes. “I’ve never been more excited than anything. It’s not that I was lying to people for the first two seasons, but this one, I’m so proud of. I’m so happy with every single episode.” And he stresses that his writers aren’t trying to poke at controversy with these all-they-really-going-there? episodes that the show offers up week after week, they are simply reflecting conversations that are happening in living rooms, bedrooms, and bars across America. “We don’t write with the intention of offending,” notes Carmichael, “we write with the intention of exploring.” Their compass tends to be pointed in the right direction.

212,http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/anthem_pulls_out_of_ohios_obam.html,"One of Ohio's top health insurers is withdrawing from the state's Obamacare marketplace, potentially leaving 20 rural counties with no exchange options starting next year. Efforts to raise Cleveland's minimum wage to $15 per hour may (or may not) have new life thanks to a recent court decision. And Ohio's latest state revenue totals show that legislators now have an even larger budget gap to fill. Today's roundup is brought to you by Jeremy Pelzer. Ohio losing big Obamacare insurer: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, one of Ohio's major health insurers, is leaving the state's Obamacare marketplace next year, according to cleveland.com's Stephen Koff. The insurer cited a shrinking market for Obamacare-related insurance and regulatory uncertainty as Republicans work on a health-care overhaul. Anthem is one of several insurance firms to leave the Ohio marketplace; unless another company steps in, 20 rural Ohio counties won't have a single Obamacare insurer starting Jan. 1. Spin cycle: The Anthem news created a flurry of reaction from politicians, parties, and advocacy groups -- and a lot of finger pointing. Republicans cited Anthem's departure as a sign of how Obamacare has failed. Meanwhile, Democrats asserted that Anthem is leaving because of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and President Donald Trump's threats to end cost-sharing-reduction payments. Speaking of Obamacare: Two female small-business owners from Ohio - Kelly Moore of Zanesville and Tracie Sanchez of Lima - were among the attendees Monday at a White House anti-Obamacare ""listening session"" with Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, according to an HHS release. $15 minimum wage fight may have new life... An aborted attempt to raise Cleveland's minimum wage to $15 per hour may be revived after a Franklin County judge last week overturned a state law blocking such efforts, according to cleveland.com's Peter Krouse. Cleveland City Councilman Jeff Johnson said Monday that he'll ask Council President Kevin Kelley and Council Clerk Pat Britt to forward already-collected referendum petitions to Cuyahoga County elections officials with the goal of putting the measure on either the Sept. 12 or Nov. 7 ballot. ...Or it might not: Kelley, who successfully sought a state law blocking the referendum, told cleveland.com he is not sure how the effort could be reactivated. And Krouse writes that ""the Ohio Revised Code suggests that now the process would have to be started from scratch, with new signatures collected."" A spokesman for the Service Employees International Union (the union behind the proposal) didn't commit to any specific course of action, mentioning that they're now looking at a statewide ballot initiative. Less money, mo' problems: Ohio tax revenues in May were $67 million (or 3.3 percent) less than expected - the ninth straight month that revenues fell short of projections. As cleveland.com's Jackie Borchardt reports, total tax revenues for the current fiscal year are now $840.7 million below estimates - widening an already-large hole for state lawmakers to fill as they draw up a new two-year budget. However, budget officials say the state will still finish the fiscal year (which ends June 30) in the black, mostly because of underspending on Medicaid. Latta gets primary rival: Republican Van Wert County Commissioner Todd Wolfrum has launched a primary challenge to U.S. Rep. Bob Latta in Ohio's 5th Congressional District, according to Roger LaPointe of the (Bowling Green) Sentinel-Tribune. Wolfrum, a Van Wert lawyer, describes himself as a pro-gun, anti-abortion conservative, but he said he agrees with liberal criticism of Latta for not holding ""town-hall"" meetings in his district about health-care reform (Latta has held a number of ""tele-town-halls"" with constituents via telephone). Hot topic: President Trump may have pulled the United States from the Paris climate accord, but the liberal city of Oberlin is still all in. As The Plain Dealer's Michael Sangiacomo writes, the Oberlin City Council voted Monday, without any dissenting voices, to condemn and admonish Trump for his decision to withdraw from the climate agreement. Infamous address: The Cincinnati marina where President Trump is set to speak today shares an address with the nightclub where the worst mass shooting in Cincinnati history took place in March, writes the Cincinnati Enquirer's Jason Williams. The marina and (now former) nightclub are just feet away from each other, though they have separate owners.

A Times editorial incorrectly linked Palin's PAC to a mass shooting — something she alleges the newspaper did deliberately, or with ""reckless disregard for the truth."" By
      
        Claudia Koerner Posted on June 27, 2017, at 9:08 p.m. ET Sarah Palin filed a lawsuit against the New York Times on Tuesday after the newspaper's editorial board incorrectly wrote that her political action committee inspired the 2011 mass shooting that seriously injured US Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others. The Times issued a correction to the June 14 editorial, which was written after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia. In the lawsuit's complaint, Palin said the correction didn't go far enough — and accused the Times of publishing the false information intentionally or recklessly because of the paper's history of hostility toward her. ""Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for falsely stating to millions of people that she, a devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who committed a substantial portion of her adult life to public service, is part of a pattern of “lethal"" politics and responsible for inciting an attack that seriously injured numerous people and killed six, including a nine-year-old girl who, at that time, was the same age as Mrs. Palin’s youngest daughter,"" the complaint reads. A spokesperson for the Times said the news organization had not yet reviewed Palin's claims, but that it would defend itself ""vigorously"" against the suit. In 2011, Palin's PAC circulated an image that put crosshairs on the Arizona congressional district represented by Giffords, as well as several other districts represented by Democrats. There has never been any evidence that the image was seen by gunman Jared Lee Loughner, who opened fire on Giffords and a group of her constituents at a Tucson congressional event. Palin's complaint states that ""speculative and unsubstantiated rumors"" about the image hurt her professional and personal life in the aftermath of the shooting. ""Among other things it led to the end of her position as a Fox News political commentator, influenced her decision not to run for President of the United States, and tainted her personal and professional image,"" the complaint states. ""It took Mrs. Palin years to overcome the detrimental impacts of the false speculation that she caused Loughner to commit murder."" The link between Palin and the shooting has been debunked by various news organizations, including the New York Times. Still, the June 14 piece by the paper's editorial board described the PAC flyer as ""political incitement,"" and a ""clear"" link to the Tucson shooting, and said it was part of a pattern of political rhetoric fueling violence. The Times later issued a correction, and apologized for the error. But Palin's complaint states that the Times' attempts to correct the record did not repair the damage to her reputation, and went against the paper's own ethics standards. We're sorry about this and we appreciate that our readers called us on the mistake. We've corrected the editorial.… https://t.co/JBdF5CmKuo Under US law, celebrities or government officials must prove defamatory statements not only hurt their reputation, but were made with ""actual malice."" That requires a publisher or speaker to know the statements are false and publish them anyway — or to act with a reckless disregard for their veracity. Palin's complaint also accuses the Times of deliberately defaming her because of its distaste for her and her politics. The suit cites a Times statement to CNN that defended the premise of the editorial, even as it apologized for the factual error. ""[The Times'] statement demonstrates that, when it comes to Mrs. Palin, The Times is willing to operate with a purposeful avoidance of the truth — marked by a deliberate decision not to acknowledge facts confirming the falsity of its charges against Mrs. Palin,"" the complaint states.

215,http://feeds.mashable.com/~r/Mashable/~3/2BKu96kkXHM/,"When it comes to hate violence impacting the LGBTQ community in 2016, there's little good news. But there are ways you can have an impact moving forward. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) released its annual report on Monday detailing what the last year looked like for the safety and well-being of LGBTQ and HIV-affected people. The results are jarring—and an essential call-to-action. Unfortunately, 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ community in the 20 years the report has existed. A total of 77 homicides of LGBTQ and HIV-affected were reported in 2016, including the mostly Latinx LGBTQ people killed in the Pulse Nightclub shooting in June 2016. LGBTQ people of color, transgender, and gender-nonconforming people made up the majority of homicides within the community. The report was released on the one year mark of the Pulse shooting—the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history— which added 49 deaths to 2016's homicide toll. Even excluding deaths associated with the Pulse massacre, there was a 17 percent increase in homicides of LGBTQ people from 2015. The three main forms of violence encountered by LGBTQ people in 2016 were verbal harassment (20 percent), threats and intimidation (17 percent), and online or mobile harassment (13 percent). The majority of hate violence survivors surveyed—a sizeable 60 percent—identified as LGBTQ people of color. Notably, of the LGBTQ people who interacted with the police in 2016, 66 percent said that police were indifferent or hostile toward them. Though many inferred their LGBTQ identity played a role in the tense interactions, many queer people reporting tense interactions were black LGBTQ individuals, following along with the current critique of racism in law enforcement. The uptick in violence toward LGBTQ people is perhaps not a surprise, given the dramatic shift in the social and political climate of the U.S. in 2016. NCAVP says that the organization has seen an increase in people reaching out for support and resources since the candidacy and election of President Donald Trump, a man who was elected on a platform rampant with hateful rhetoric. ""Many LGBTQ people are fearful that people who hold bias beliefs will feel legitimized by seeing their beliefs being enacted into policies and political actions at the highest levels of our government,"" said Emily Waters, senior manager of national research and policy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. ""Efforts to pass discriminatory legislation and actions that would decrease the rights of LGBTQ people in housing, healthcare, education, and public accommodations target the exact places where LGBTQ people are reporting experiencing violence."" An essential part of the report is a call to action by NCAVP to mobilize around LGBTQ rights and acceptance, which is the only way to shift the tide. In the report, the organization includes suggested tweets that people can use to bring attention to especially notable statistics as well as shareable graphics to amplify the report's findings. ""Hate crimes legislation alone will not address the many ways homophobia, transphobia, biphobia, and other forms of oppression play out in our communities, in our workplaces, schools, and homes every day,"" Waters said. ""We want people to move beyond the numbers of violence and start taking action."" Here's a few ways NCAVP suggests taking action against LGBTQ hate violence: More in

Let's do a comparison. Saudi Arabia exports Wahhabism, a perverted version of Islam that is the single most destructive ideology in the world today and the source of the anti-Western propaganda that endangers citizens of Europe, Canada, the United States and Asian nations like the Philippines. Saudis fund schools throughout the Islamic world that teach this version of the religion. They also export oil, which in the long run will be even more destructive than their religious fanaticism. Cuba exports cigars, great music, baseball players and doctors. Saudi Arabia prohibits women from driving and appearing in public without a male member of the family on hand and segregates women from men in all public settings including religious services. Cuban women face no such restrictions. On 9/11 there were zero Cuban hijackers; there were 17 Saudis. Cuba is far from perfect, but it is far less dangerous to us and the world than Saudi Arabia. Trump made an incendiary speech about the dangers of Cuba to our way of life and rolled back reforms instituted by Barack Obama. Two weeks ago he signed a deal to sell Saudi Arabia $110 billion of military gear. Is it just me or does this seem to be backwards? Robert Smith, Tampa Rancor breeds violence | June 15, editorial Anger in print I read your editorial entitled ""Rancor breeds violence."" I notice you do not mention your own responsibility in the ""deeply partisan and flatly soulless atmosphere."" Really? Your newspaper regularly publishes angry partisan and often uninformed editorials on Page 1, the local section, the editorial page, the sports section and even the comics. Most are not labeled editorials, but they should be. Lawrence P. Marlin, Oldsmar A gruesome toll Last week's violence in Virginia was the 153rd mass shooting so far this year. According the Gun Violence Archive, there have been nearly 7,000 gun deaths so far this year, not including suicides, and more than 13,000 firearm injuries. On any given day, 93 people in the United States die from gun violence. There are too many guns in this country, and the myth that arming more folks with firearms will solve or lessen our gun violence problems and make us safer is a sad commentary on our collective mentality. Nowhere in the civilized world are the gun violence statistics so gruesome. We should heed the words of Gabrielle Giffords, who asked us to have the courage ""to work toward a safer world, together."" Joan Lund, Tampa An attack on all of us The shooting outside Washington, D.C., has ignited the usual passions of partisanship and the attempts to place blame, but like so many attacks of the past it is so much more. It isn't an attack on a group based on who or what they are, but rather it is an attack on all of us. When someone physically attacks others because of their political beliefs, he attacks the foundation established from our inception for the peaceful transfer of power with ballots, not bullets, and such an attack is on us all. When someone attacks others in a peaceful assembly in a house of worship because of their race, that is an attack on the concept that we all stand equal and that is an attack on us all. When someone attacks others because of their faith, a concept so important that it is the first right in the Bill of Rights, it isn't an attack on a particular faith but rather an attack on one of the most basic of freedoms we hold dear, and when others wish to marginalize those of a particular faith they are not attacking that faith but they attack us all. We cannot, we should not, we must not, look at such events as an attempt to gain advantage but rather see them for what they are: an attack on the very fabric of what those men so many years ago tried to give us — a more perfect union. Dennis Schoch, Spring Hill Two shootings, two results  | June 17, letter Police stopped the shooter The letter writer comparing a horrific shooting of three people by a gunman and the shooting incident at the GOP baseball practice states that it was the Second Amendment that saved the congressmen. In truth, it was highly trained Capitol Police officers — not some person with the three hours of questionable training required to obtain a permit. I shudder at the thought of a citizen with a gun trying to take down a lunatic with a gun. Bob Rosenberger, Spring Hill Once refugees, now citizens | June 17 Immigrants who invest I was pleased to read this article and wish every new citizen success in their new country. However, when I read stories like this it frustrates me and my non-immigrant status community throughout the United States who are on E2 investment visas. We are the forgotten group that invest in the United States, create hundreds of thousands of jobs and pay our taxes. In my case, I have been here 26 years and employ 60 people in St. Petersburg. Every five years we have to leave the country to renew our visa in London at great expense, plus a very large legal bill. Then, every two years we have to leave the country to renew our I94 visa, again at great expense, plus we cannot claim homestead exemption. Our visa status does not allow us to apply for a green card that leads to citizenship but keeps us in a kind of limbo when at anytime the immigration service can revoke our visa and deport us. News outlets have never done an in-depth study of the E2 community because, I believe, we keep our heads down, pay taxes and do not create controversy or sensational headlines.

Other marchers went for humor, invoking pop culture references both timeless and two weeks old. But signs and chants also highlighted the broader anger and anxiety that many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people have felt under the Trump administration, which is threatening to undo some of the community's hard-fought advances. ""We're here! We're queer! Get that Cheeto out of here!"" was among the chants directed at Trump as marchers paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol in Washington, the Associated Press reported. The events also took on an emotional, reflective tone as participants remembered the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting. Forty-nine people were killed on June 12, 2016, after a gunman opened fire into the Orlando gay bar, making it the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. The Equality March in Washington, the weekend's centerpiece event, was timed to arrive a day before the tragic anniversary. The L.A. Pride March this year renamed itself #ResistMarch in solidarity with Equality Marches nationwide. ""We simply felt that in 2017 we need to return to our roots and protest so that those who would roll back our hard-won human rights are put on notice that we will not stand idly by,"" L.A. Pride organizers said on the event's website. Leaders of the Equality March stressed the need for unity and inclusion to help end the ""hostile rhetoric, discriminatory policies, and violence perpetrated against the most vulnerable in our communities,"" including those targeted due to immigration status, skin color, religion, or disability. ""We affirm and celebrate that we are a mix of diverse communities,"" the organizers said. Related Video: Internet collectively cries watching Sia's tribute to Orlando victims More in

224,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/358572244/0/phoenix/nation~was-the-deadliest-year-on-record-for-the-LGBTQ-community/,"The gruesome attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando a year ago was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. Yet even without those 49 victims, 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBTQ community, according to a report released Monday by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP). Outside of the lives lost at Pulse nightclub, the NCAVP found a 17% increase in hate killings from the previous year. The group collected data on 1,036 incidents of hate violence from 12 local NCAVP member organizations in 11 states for its 20th annual report, ""Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and HIV-Affected Hate Violence in 2016."" ""I think with increased visibility comes increased vulnerability,"" said Shelby Chestnut, director of community organizing and public advocacy at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. Opinion: Christian clergyman on Pulse, 1 year later: We must protect the vulnerable In the U.S., gay marriage had been set as a benchmark for equality. But advocates say the Supreme Court's ruling in 2015 — which made same-sex marriage a legal right — was never a measure of societal or cultural acceptance of the LGBTQ community. It was never a guarantee their lives were safe. Here are just some of the crimes committed against LGBTQ people in 2016: ""We're not sending clear messages that LGBTQ lives are valued,"" Chestnut said. Since the presidential election, the New York City Anti-Violence Project has seen a 45% increase in calls to its violence hotline. More than 100 anti-LGBTQ bills in 29 states have been introduced in the past five months, according to the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), a think tank that researches and analyzes state and federal laws with LGBTQ implications. ""Right now you see marginalized communities being pushed further to the margins than ever before,"" Chestnut said. The number of Americans who report knowing a transgender person doubled in seven years, according to a 2015 GLAAD survey. From Caitlyn Jenner to Laverne Cox, the trans community is more visible then ever, yet trans people, especially trans women of color, face significant barriers to their health and safety, according to the 2015 report, ""Understanding Issues Facing Transgender Americans,"" co-authored by MAP, the National Center for Transgender Equality and the Transgender Law Center. Trans people have the least access to resources, to social capital, to housing, to jobs and to medical care. Transgender people in the U.S. are nearly four times as likely to be living in extreme poverty, according to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey. ""It puts folks in places where they are more likely to be unsafe,"" said Beth Hamilton, associate director at the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence. Hate crimes against transgender people are shockingly common. According to the Williams Institute at UCLA, only 0.6% of U.S. adults identify as transgender, yet the NCAVP said in 2016 it tracked 21 homicides of transgender and gender-non-conforming people. In 2017 so far, it's tracked 12, and 10 of them have been transgender women of color. Transgender people, Hamilton said, are also especially vulnerable to sexual violence. Studies suggest half of transgender people will experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. ""If the only way somebody is going to validate my gender identity or the only access to physical touch I experience is going to be something that is harmful to me or problematic, I'm going to be less likely to sort of stop the behavior,"" said Hamilton, who identifies as gender variant and uses the pronouns ""they"" and ""them."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who identify as LGBTQ experience sexual violence at rates equal to or higher than heterosexuals: Existing statistics likely don't reveal how pervasive sexual violence is in the LGBTQ community, Hamilton said. Sexual assault is a notoriously under-reported crime, and advocates suspect the rates of reporting are even lower for LGBTQ survivors. ""Folks feel like, well, we're already stigmatized, and people already think a certain thing of us, so putting that out there for the world to see is not something that feels good,"" Hamilton said. The ways sexual violence plays out in LGBTQ relationships may sometimes look different from heterosexual ones, especially if an LGBTQ person has not shared their identity publicly. ""If there are folks who are not 'out' in their families or in their communities, that's an added tactic"" a perpetrator could use to intimidate a victim, Hamilton said. As a child, Hamilton was sexually assaulted by a man, and said another obstacle they experienced talking about their assault was overcoming the worry that doing so might undermine their identity. ""I genuinely believe at 38 years old my mom still thinks that because I was assaulted as a child that's why I am queer,"" Hamilton said. For years Hamilton was reluctant to disclose the assault for fear others would think the same. ""I think that sparing yourself from some of that — whether that's internalized homophobia or whatever it is — becomes a safety mechanism,"" Hamilton said. Hamilton is also a survivor of intimate partner violence, which they experienced with their first girlfriend. After Hamilton came out, their family struggled to accept their identity, and in hindsight Hamilton said that made them more vulnerable. ""I kind of isolated myself, and didn't have a lot of folks I could lean on, to sort of say, I need help getting out,"" Hamilton said. And what's more: sexual violence in queer women's spaces is often harder to name than in hetero ones cause we're told it's not possible... When an LGBTQ person does seek help, they face additional obstacles. The NCAVP found that 66% of LGBTQ survivors who interacted with police said police were indifferent or hostile. The report found black LGBTQ survivors were nearly three times more likely to experience excessive force from law enforcement. LGBTQ sexual assault survivors also face barriers in both accessing and receiving support from service providers such as crisis centers, support groups and shelters. ""Services are sort of set up with this model survivor in mind,"" Hamilton said. ""I think that for many folks who come from oppressed communities, what they are actually met with are services that don't quite work for them, or they don't see themselves represented in the staff or the setting."" A 2015 report from the NCAVP found nearly half of LGBTQ survivors who had experienced intimate partner violence and tried to access an emergency shelter had been turned away. Of those, 71% reported they were denied services because of their gender identity. A women's-only shelter, for example, may not accept a trans woman. Chestnut said, despite the daunting statistics that show violence against the LGBTQ community is on the rise, there is something she finds encouraging: More and more people are reaching out to the organization asking how they can help and intervene on behalf of LGBTQ people. The group typically holds one volunteer orientation per month, but had to add several more in the months following the presidential election to fill the demand. How to be an ally: During Pride Month and beyond ""People are dying as a result of anti-LGBT violence almost daily in this country, and it is everyone's problem,"" Chestnut said. ""People need to understand that it's happening in their communities whether they're wealthy communities, poor communities, white communities, communities of color, immigrant communities. ... Now, more than ever, people need to stand up and defend the rights of LGBT people.""

225,http://www.chicagotribune.com/ct-fathers-day-profile-20170615-story.html,"The day begins, as it often does, with a tiny voice insistently calling, ""Up, up."" Alexis Tellez rolls over and lifts Tonny, 2, out of the crib inches from his bed, carrying him to the bathroom, then kitchen where Tellez cooks them chorizo and eggs for breakfast. On this morning at least, the young father can be grateful his son didn't wake him by climbing out of the crib and diving into his bed. These quiet moments with his son in their family's Brighton Park two-flat are special to Tellez, 20, who was a junior in high school when his girlfriend at the time surprised him with news she was pregnant. She showed him the positive test in a FaceTime call to prove it after he thought she was joking, he said. Tellez's parents were furious at first but grew supportive as their son — listening to advice he received from them, his principal and social worker — decided he wouldn't drop out of Curie Metro High School but would finish and began looking for work. ""I was scared about it and I wasn't ready to be a father,"" Tellez said of the moment he learned he would be a dad. ""Now I have to be a man to take responsibility for my son,"" he said. ""It's a lot, but I have to accept that. I wake up in the morning, go to work and I do it again … I gotta do what I gotta do to make money for my son."" Tellez is the first-ever father in the teen-parenting program run by One Hope United, a longtime social services agency, and has sole custody of his son. The agency's Wings program is designed to help young parents understand their baby's behavior, nurture their child and cope with challenges. He also in some ways represents the new face of fathers in Cook County, where nearly half of child-custody cases now involve unmarried parents, officials say. A soft-spoken but prolific talker who loves to joke, Tellez has already overcome a lot, including a childhood illness that took much of his hearing. He wears hearing aids in both ears and endured years of bullying growing up in the gang-infested neighborhood. ""You never know what's going to happen,"" he said. ""I have to accept the way I am — I'm happy to have the hearing aids."" Although he says he once hung out with gang members, Tellez long ago traded the lure of the streets for family life and uses the money he earns from two food-service jobs to help pay for family expenses like groceries and car repairs along with his son's bills. Tellez knows he's lucky to have a strong family support system that allows him to work while his mother cares for his son. On this Father's Day — which Tellez, who works every day except Monday, will be working — he has three dreams: to buy his own car; get certified as a forklift operator; and perhaps, one day, move with his family to a safer neighborhood on the North Side. ""I want my kids to be happy,"" he said. ""Play outside, go to school."" It took more than two years of scraping by on part-time work — just two to three shifts a week at an Englewood Church's Chicken — before Tellez finally found a full-time job as a banquet server at the Hilton in Oak Lawn this spring. He learned he had been hired at about the same time a Cook County judge formally awarded him custody of Tonny (pronounced Tony) after the boy's mother didn't participate in the case, court records show. All the unexpected good fortune left Tellez, who prayed frequently for these things at nearby St. Pancratius, a little thunderstruck. His boss at Church's had a similar reaction with Tellez told her he wasn't quitting — he still wanted to work one day a week. His boss at Hilton had a similar view of Tellez. ""He's a hard worker,"" said Clemente Zavala, 38, who started at the hotel 20 years ago speaking almost no English and now is the Hilton's banquet supervisor. ""I gave him the opportunity and he did a great job."" ""He told me he's a father. He said he wants to do better for his son. I said, 'Show me that you are a father.' When we're working we have to focus on what we're doing. He's doing a good job,"" said Zavala, who recently assigned Tellez to work as a captain supervising other servers at a dinner. ""Every day he's learning something."" Twice monthly, Tellez meets with One Hope United social worker Deborah Bashir, who chats with him about raising his son, building the boy's vocabulary, knowledge and fine motor skills. She usually brings books, puzzles or toys. The social services agency first connected with the family after a referral from the hospital where Tonny was born. Tellez is an unusual client, not only because he's a father, but also because he's working two jobs yet is there for every appointment with her. ""I think he's doing a really good job (as a parent) — he's very nurturing, he's very patient,"" Bashir said. ""All of my primary caregivers are female, so it's a little different to see the father take on that role."" ""He does what he does because he loves Tonny and he wants what's best for him. I tell him it's the biggest, hardest job but it's the most rewarding raising children."" Bashir lately has been working with the family about the tantrum stage Tonny is going through and also encouraging Tellez to get Tonny, who still mostly uses one-word sentences, to talk more. Tellez speaks to the boy in English and Spanish and sometimes uses sign language. She'll work with the family until next summer, when they can enroll Tonny in a Chicago Public Schools preschool program. In addition to getting some help from the social service agency, Tellez said he was lucky to have role models in both his parents, including his father, Ismael who works 12 hours a day, six days at week at two jobs as a repairman. His father also helped him and his brother find jobs at the Hilton — he put out word his sons were looking for work, and a co-worker related to Zavala put them in touch. Also living in the family's two-flat are Tellez's mother, Evangelina, his older brother, Julio and a younger brother, who is just a year older than Tonny. His mother has made it possible for Tellez to work, relieving him of the burden to find child care by watching Tonny herself while his father is at work. Still, Tellez remains concerned for his family's safety. Last month, his working-class Brighton Park neighborhood, a former enclave for Eastern European immigrants that is now predominately Hispanic with a small but growing Asian presence, had the city's worst mass shooting in almost four years. Police said two gunmen with high-powered rifles opened fire on mourners at a memorial for another shooting victim, part of an ongoing gang war in the neighborhood. A brother and sister were killed and eight others wounded. On an afternoon earlier this month, a man talking through an open van window to his girlfriend and their two young children was shot in the head despite pleading, ""I'm with my kids!"" to two teens who asked about his gang affiliation. In February three men were killed inside a home not far from James Shields Elementary School in what prosecutors later said was a drug deal gone bad. Two white crosses along with about a dozen candles remain outside the front door. The two-story home is on the route Tellez walks with his son each day, past a colorful corner store that closed soon after the February murders. Most days at midmorning when Tonny is getting restless, Tellez suggests they take a stroll. He walks backward down the flight of stairs from their second-floor apartment guiding Tonny, who takes the steps two feet at a time. On a recent day, Tonny steps through the front door blinking into the light, breathing in the smell of fresh-cut grass. He turns immediately left, clutching his father's pinkie with his hand, his footsteps twice the speed of his dad's. There's so much to see. Brighton Park is a different world at 10:30 a.m. Tonny walks by a woman watering her roses, neighbors cracking jokes on the stoop, a woman and her daughter tending to the potted plants on their front steps. Some things make Tonny stop in his tracks — the man pushing a car tire down the sidewalk, a big pickup truck and a street vendor pushing his elotes cart down the street. He picks a green leaf from a budding plant and shows it to Tellez. But he doesn't notice the police cameras or the signs on home windows that reads ""Never mind the dog, beware of owner"" and ""We call police."" The neighborhood is too dangerous to let Tonny be outside except in the morning, Tellez said. He doesn't let his son play at the parks but sometimes Tonny and his uncle play in the backyard under a fruit tree their grandfather brought back from Mexico years ago. Tellez scowls as he recalls the day a Gangster Two-Six Nation member flashed gang signs at him as he walked on Albany Avenue with his son. ""I told him how can he do that in front of my son?"" Tellez never joined a gang, he says. But for a time in high school, he hung out with Latin King gang members, staying out late and worrying his parents, Tellez told the Tribune. But eventually he chose family over life on the streets. When he was a sophomore, his mother became pregnant with his youngest brother and Tellez began coming straight home from school each day to help take care of him. Back home from their walk, Tonny enters the apartment to find his uncle and cousin shouting into plastic cups as ""Curious George"" — Tonny's favorite TV show — plays on the television. His grandmother Evangelina has made pasta for lunch and Tonny takes small bites, picking up bits of noodles he finds unsatisfactory and returning them to a napkin she's holding. ""He's a fussy eater,"" Evangelina Tellez explains with a smile. She watches Tonny for hours while her son is at work. One day Tonny jumped in his crib as his father got dressed — strapping on a Velcro back brace and putting on a black dress shirt and pants. Tellez kissed his son goodbye, left home and got into the passenger seat of the family's trusty Honda Accord as his brother Julio drove them both to work at the Hilton in Oak Lawn. They drove past Tellez's old high school as they made their way to the banquet hall, which was hosting the Little Village Lawndale High School prom. The brothers arrived at work early and clocked in, and Tellez began sorting silverware for the dinner service, instructing a new hire — a close friend Tellez had recommended — how to properly shine each piece. Back home late after work, Tellez walks past graduation photos of him and his brother up on the wall near a porcelain angel that reads ""Devote Yourselves to Prayer with a Thankful Heart"" then enters his room, where Tonny's baby prints hang on the wall. Tellez still gets emotional thinking about the April day in 2015 when his son was born. He rushed to catch a series of buses and broke down when he held his 5-pound son for the first time at Mount Sinai Hospital. ""I started crying and I told him, 'Welcome to my family,'"" Tellez said. ""He changed my life. I'm not thinking about myself anymore — I'm thinking about my family.' sschmadeke@chicagotribune.com Twitter @SteveSchmadeke CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-06-16 06:00:00,Man who became father in his teens: My son 'changed my life',,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

227,http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/06/15/june-16-letters-despite-mass-shootings-nra-still-controls-congress/,"Trending: Mass shootings in Alexandria and San Francisco brought the total number of U.S. mass shootings in 2017 to 154. The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as any incident in which four or more people are shot and/or killed. The United States has now had 154 mass shootings in the first 165 days of the year. Pause a moment and think about that.  Despite polls that show that the majority of Americans favor tightening gun control laws, the most powerful lobbying group in America, the NRA, continues to control Congress. The result of the NRA’s efforts is that we have at least 300 million guns in America.  Ironically, I’m sure the response by Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the NRA, is that our congressmen on that Alexandria ball field would have been safer if they had been packing a few guns in their ball bags. Steve Ode
San Jose I feel great empathy for the Congressmen and staff who were shot at while playing softball.  It must have been an incredibly terrifying experience for them. However, it has long been the policy of many political leaders to have little or no restrictions on gun ownership and  no effective background checks for criminals or the mentally ill.  Or the types of guns allowed: high powered semi-automatic assault rifles and deadly enhanced handguns. I wonder if their allegiance to the NRA will be called into question, especially by those who were in the line of fire. And if they will now have new empathy for their fellow citizens who live in neighborhoods where these shootings occur regularly — not to members of Congress, but to terrified children and their friends and families. Carole Matsumoto
San Jose Regarding the San Jose director of economic gridlock, Kim Walesh’s comments (Letters, June 14), that the area where Google is planning to move is a transit hub. Most of Google’s employees travel by car or Google bus. Unless Google plans to incorporate housing for their employees into this new development I see a tipping point for traffic in San Jose. Here is an idea: don’t approve any employee parking in Google’s new building and force their employees to take mass transit. The other stipulation should be that the building can not open until BART has installed its proposed downtown hub. Russ Hills
San Jose Barry Goldman-Hall (Letters, June 15) and other critics of Google’s downtown San Jose campus plans fail to consider the multitude of benefits this type of project will bring to downtown, in the form of jobs, shorter commute times for workers, fewer commuter cars on the highways, and economic activity for downtown businesses. The teachers, gardeners, etc., who work in Silicon Valley already have difficulty affording to live here. The solution is requiring Google to incorporate a good proportion of affordable housing in their ambitious plans. Greg Salerno
San Jose I have heard a proposal to reduce the size of Bears Ears National Monument.  I do not think there is any precedent for eliminating or reducing a national monument.  Perhaps, if the name were changed to “Trump’s Hands National Monument,” the president would block any reduction. Robert Lindley
 San Jose When California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment announced that weed killer glyphosate made its Proposition 65 list of chemicals suspected of causing cancer, environmental groups cheered – but not for the reasons you may suspect. Although Center for Environmental Health and As You Sow claim to champion environmental and public health, public record indicates that the groups earned a combined $5.5 million using Proposition 65 to exploit businesses since 2000. And with the top-selling weed killer joining the fold next year, that number is sure to skyrocket. Democratic Assemblyman Ed Chau recently introduced a bill to limit the number of meritless lawsuits filed under Proposition 65, but his provision continues to languish in the state Senate. Until Californians realize what little effect the warnings on their sunglasses, pancake mix, and parking lots have on public health, Proposition 65’s lawsuit-inducing legacy will endure.

Democratic senators are planning to hold the Senate floor until at least midnight on Monday to thrash Senate Republicans for refusing to hold committee hearings on their healthcare overhaul, according to several people familiar with the plan. The round of speeches is being organized by Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Brian Schatz of Hawaii. But on the more weighty question of whether to object to the GOP’s committee hearings or refusing to allow routine business in the Senate regarding nomination votes or uncontroversial matters, the party has made no final decision. While the party’s liberal wing is demanding that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and his team shut the Senate down, Schumer has made no decision and often tries to forge consensus in his caucus before executing party strategy. Though several sources on the party's left believe Schumer may be open to the idea, Democratic leaders have been resistant to procedural obstruction thus far. They believe blocking unrelated matters could shift the spotlight from Republicans’ secretive process to Democratic obstruction. Democrats are now upset about the lack of transparency over a health care bill. Well, that’s just the seat of irony.

230,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-illinois-congressman-virginia-shooting-20170614-story.html,"U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis of downstate Taylorville was at home plate during the Republican congressional team's baseball practice Wednesday when gunfire erupted. ""I was up to bat and I heard a loud noise that I thought was a construction site dropping a large piece of metal,"" Davis told the Tribune. ""And the next thing I heard was one of my colleagues, or somebody else on the field, saying, 'Run, he's got a gun.' So that's exactly what I did."" The gunman, who was near the dugout on the third baseline when he opened fire, wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, the majority whip in the House, and several others, including a congressional staffer and two law enforcement officers who were providing security at the field, officials said. The gunman was wounded when police returned fire, and he later died. He has been identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., about 80 miles south of where Davis lives. ""It makes me nauseous,"" said Davis, adding that he learned the gunman was from Illinois during a media interview. Davis, 47, is in his third term and has played baseball for the GOP congressional team — he is the catcher — throughout his tenure. He said there were children milling around the playing field and people out walking their dogs when the quiet morning in Alexandria, Va., was disrupted by gunfire. ""I never thought I'd go to a baseball practice for a charity game, where Republicans and Democrats come together, and have to dodge bullets,"" Davis said. In an earlier interview with CNN, Davis said he dove into the first baseline dugout along with other players. ""By the time I got there from home plate, I was on top of a couple people — didn't think that was the best place to be … an open dugout, so I tried to get out of there. ""When there seemed to be a break in activity, I and others, we dispersed up into the street,"" taking cover behind cars, Davis said. He said someone called out that the gunman was coming up the street. ""A good Samaritan let us into his apartment so we could call 911,"" Davis said. ""I also called my family."" ""It's my breaking point, we have to stop this,"" he said. U.S. Reps. John Shimkus and Darin LaHood of Illinois are on the GOP team's roster but were not at the practice, their offices said. In the CNN interview, Davis blamed the shooting on the ""hateful"" tone of politics in the country and said it ""could be the first political rhetorical terrorist act."" ""I believe there is such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now … on social media and the 24-hour news cycle. This has got to stop. ""We can disagree on how to govern — that's what makes this country great,"" he said. ""I think Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say, 'Stop, let's work together, let's get things done. We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate.'"" The lawmaker told the Tribune he has seen social media posts attributed to the gunman, and ""he didn't look like he was too keen on Republican policies."" U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Channahon in Will County, who has played on the GOP baseball team in the past, joined Davis and other lawmakers in lamenting the ugly tone of today's politics. A look at the congressman's Facebook page will show that things have gotten ""so personal and so angry,"" he said during an afternoon conference call with reporters. Kinzinger said that there has been an increasing number of death threats against him and other lawmakers, and that the frequency of death threats was ""overwhelming"" the Capitol Police. He said lawmakers needed to join hands and realize that as political debates ensue, ""we can do it without … violence, extreme hate and anger."" When congressional leaders announced Wednesday, during a closed-door briefing, that Thursday night's Republicans versus Democrats game would go on, there was a standing ovation, Kinzinger said. Going on to play the game ""sends a very strong and powerful message,"" he said. During the closed-door briefing, there were a ""lotta tears shed,"" Kinzinger said. ""All of us are really shaken by this,"" U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, an Evanston Democrat, said as she left the closed-door meeting. ""There was an incredible tone of unity,"" she said. ""And all of us need to take responsibility for the tone and for the fact that we are one, in terms of our love for our country and our vulnerability. ""And we need to stand together as Democrats and Republicans,"" she added. Security in and around the Capitol was ratcheted up after the mass shooting in nearby Alexandria. Schakowsky said Capitol Police and the House sergeant-at-arms indicated enhanced protective measures will be taken on Capitol Hill as well as at Thursday's congressional ballgame and next week's congressional picnic at the White House. U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Moline who plays shortstop on a women's congressional softball team, lamented that the mass shooting targeted a rare bipartisan extracurricular activity. ""This is one of the few things that we have in Washington, D.C., where we build camaraderie,"" she said. ""And it's designed to help charitable causes, give us a release, come together with our colleagues and have fun. And now you've got a lunatic who is making the decision to come out and shoot five people and is disrupting something that actually is good in Washington, D.C."" Davis, in his Tribune interview, said he was heartened that the congressional baseball game at Nationals Park would be played. ""Obviously security is going to be enhanced after a tragedy like today, but I'm glad the game is going on,"" he said. ""This is our chance to remind everyone in this country that we're Americans.

231,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/6/14/1671719/-Republicans-rush-to-politicize-shooting-at-congressional-baseball-practice,"One of the rituals in the immediate wake of a mass shooting in America is for people who support stronger gun laws to be told not to politicize it, a rule that in no way applies to the gun-loving crowd. And with four people wounded, including Rep. Steve Scalise, in a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice Wednesday morning, the push is on to politicize the event from the right. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted someone linking the shooting to the production of Julius Caesar featuring a Trump-like Caesar. (Still waiting on the retroactive outrage over an Obama-era production featuring an Obama-like Caesar.) Kellyanne Conway retweeted—with hashtag “this”—a quote from one of the Republicans in attendance at the practice saying someone he thought may have been the shooter had asked if it was Republicans or Democrats practicing. Rep. Chris Collins pointed a finger at Democrats, saying “The rhetoric has been outrageous, the finger-pointing, just the tone and the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump” and that this can “fuel the fires.” For the record, we still don’t know anything about the shooter, and whether it turns out to be politically motivated or not and whatever his politics, shooting people is a terrible thing. But whatever you do, don’t politicize it by pointing out that stronger gun laws might possibly have made it harder for the shooter to get a gun. Or to get a gun that could get off so many shots so quickly. Possibly! Sorry for getting all political on you, there—I realize that’s a right reserved for Donald Trump Jr. And for the record:  Virginia:No background checksNo licensingNo registrationNo permit reqÃ¢ÂÂd for concealed carry of long gunsOpen carry long guns & handguns ",2017-06-14 02:45:00,Republicans rush to politicize shooting at congressional baseball practice,,115,http://www.dailykos.com
232,http://www.thedailybeast.com/sandy-hook-dad-on-performance-artist-alex-joness-trial-i-wish-i-could-be-there-to-stare-him-down,"SEARCH The InfoWars founder, who is in court battling for custody of his two children, previously claimed the Sandy Hook shootings were a false flag. In a pretrial hearing defending InfoWars founder Alex Jones, lawyer Randall Wilhite argued to Texas Judge Orlinda Naranjo that his client should retain custody of his children, saying Jones is a “performance artist” who is “playing a character” on his radio and internet TV show. If his defense is true, Leonard Pozner believes Jones’ decades-long performance has destroyed too many lives—including his own. “I wish I could be there in the courtroom to stare him down to remind him of how he’s throwing salt on a wound, and so he can remember how he handed out salt for other people to throw on mine,” said Pozner. Pozner’s 6-year-old son, Noah, was one of 20 children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. Six staff members also died in the shooting. Since then, he and his family have been the target of a conspiracy theory, fueled most prominently by Jones and InfoWars, that the shooting never really happened, and that the 20 dead children were actually “crisis actors” planted by the United States government in a false flag operation to drum up support for stricter gun control laws. Since the massacre in 2012, Jones’ site repeatedly ran stories with headlines like “Mystery: Sandy Hook Victim Dies (Again) In Pakistan” and “College Professor Says ‘Crisis Actors’ May Have Played Part If Sandy Hook Was Indeed a Hoax.” In November, Jones released a “final statement” on Sandy Hook, where Jones said, “All I know is the official story of Sandy Hook has more holes in it than Swiss cheese.” Jones’ name trended on Twitter in the United States on Monday, but he didn’t reference the ongoing trial on InfoWars’ livestream that afternoon. But in Jones’ pretrial hearing, his lawyer argued that judging Jones based on his InfoWars persona “would be like judging Jack Nicholson in a custody dispute based on his performance as the Joker in ‘Batman.’” The effects of the stories, even if rooted in fiction—as Jones’ lawyers will try to convince a jury this week—have real and devastating consequences. Pozner has been inundated with threats and harassment from conspiracy theorists insistent that his son was never alive to begin with. Last year, a Florida Atlantic University professor sent the couple a certified letter demanding proof that Noah ever existed. (The professor, James Tracy, was subsequently fired.) Pozner said he’s talked to guests on InfoWars’ radio show who confessed that Jones is playing a part, but that he’d “never seen (an admission) this overt” that Jones was playing a part stated by one of his representatives. “I’ve heard it said before Jones is playing a character. ‘That’s showbusiness,’ one of his guests told me,” said Pozner. “That’s why he makes millions of dollars spinning conspiracy theories and sensationalizing mass casualty events and geopolitical crises.” Jones is seeking to retain full custody of his children in a divorce case that will take place in Austin, where Jones lives and where InfoWars is headquartered, over the next two weeks. Jones’ ex-wife, Kelly Jones, says the InfoWars creator is “not a stable person” and is seeking custody of their 9-year-old and 12-year-old daughters. According to the American-Statesman, Kelly Jones says Alex “broadcasts from home” and “the children are there, watching him broadcast.” Pozner, for one, agrees with Jones’s lawyers defense, that the InfoWars host is playing a character, creating conspiracies for show. Pozner points to one video about Sandy Hook victims “dying again” that he had removed from YouTube. “He spent a day or two ranting and raving about me and complaining. It’s really evident to see that he’s acting in that particular episode of the show. He’s tugging on his tie. He’s very uncomfortable. Most of it sounded like a teenager lying in front you,” said Pozner, who founded the HONR Network, which provides support for victims affected by mass shooting conspiracies. Still, Jones’ conspiracy radio show has earned him millions of fans, including the President of the United States himself. Trump went on that very same radio show in December of 2015 to commend Jones’ work, telling the InfoWars host that “your reputation is amazing” and “I will not let you down.” On the very same day of Trump’s interview, InfoWars ran an article insinuating the San Bernardino shooting was also a false flag, before claiming that it was a “false flag for the Obama anti-gun agenda” five days later. Jones’s lawyers will spend the next two weeks trying to convince a jury that his radio show is a particularly realistic, if cruel, public performance in front of reporters in an Austin courtroom. So does Pozner believe repeated tacit admissions that Jones is performing as a “Joker”-like character will make any difference to his 2-million subscribers on YouTube alone? “No, of course not. This is how they’re going to hear it: ‘The message is important, the conspiracies are real. I act like a lunatic because it gets people’s attention.’ That would be my guess,” said Pozner. “Alex is going to say something like, ‘Well, the conspiracy message that I’m delivering is important. My on-air personality that screams, shakes fists, makes animal noises? That’s part of my animated persona.’”",2017-06-06 14:34:27,Sandy Hook Dad on ‘Performance Artist’ Alex Jones’s Trial: ‘I Wish I Could Be There to Stare Him Down’,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

234,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-pride-losangeles-idUSKBN1920GF,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Lucy Nicholson 4 Min Read LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people dressed in rainbow attire and waving protest signs walked en masse through Los Angeles on Sunday in a “Resist March” against U.S. President Donald Trump, an event that took the place of the city’s annual Pride parade. The 3-mile (4.8km) walk began in Hollywood and culminated with a rally in gay-friendly West Hollywood featuring Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of U.S. House of Representatives, the city’s liberal Mayor Eric Garcetti and drag queen icon RuPaul. “We’re people,” said Mary Demasters, 29, who wore a rainbow cape draped over her shoulders and a rainbow sticker on cheek. “We deserve to be treated like people, all of us, no matter what our differences are. We’re all people.” Reflecting this year’s emphasis on the common ground of liberal causes, including LGBT rights, Demasters carried a placard that read: “When you come for one of us, you come for all of us.” The event brought together a range of groups at the forefront of the country’s most contentious political issues, including Planned Parenthood, Black Lives Matter, the American Civil Liberties Union and GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization. “This was not the year for parades. This was the year to take to the streets and march,” said Stephen Macias, a spokesman for the organizers, highlighting the wave of protests across the country since Trump’s election in November. “The march is still about celebrating our community but it’s also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,” Macias said. The decision to shift the event’s emphasis drew criticism from some in Southern California’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and “queer” community, who say the one day of the year set aside to celebrate their LGBTQ identities should not be given over to other political causes. It marks the second year in a row that Los Angeles Pride organizers have faced dissension. In 2016, some activists boycotted pride events on the grounds that they had lost their focus on the larger gay community to become a music festival catering largely younger people. Macias said the complaints about this year’s Resist March reflected a misunderstanding about the intentions of the organizers. The weekend would still feature gay pride festivities across the Los Angeles area, he said. “The march is still about celebrating our community but it’s also about recognizing the climate we live in and the delicate balance around civil rights,” he said. The march this year was staged a day after anti-corporate protesters briefly blocked the route of a Washington, D.C., pride parade, in part to voice their opposition to such backers as Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N. The Washington protesters also demanded the addition of a transgender minority woman to the board of organizer Capital Pride Alliance, and that the parade bar police officers from marching. In response, Ryan Bos, executive director of Capital Pride Alliance, released a statement on Sunday acknowledging the importance of considering differing points of view. “We encourage a robust, civil, and healthy conversation within the community about all of the issues that impact us and look forward to having a mutually respectful conversation in the days, weeks, and months ahead,” Bos said. Gay pride events are scheduled for major cities across the United States this month, some of them this weekend. In San Francisco, pride organizers have not dropped their parade in favor of a protest but the SF Weekly newspaper reported that the event would include a “resistance contingent” and an immigrant rights speaker. The owner of the shuttered Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, is set to open its doors early on Monday in remembrance of victims of a mass shooting there on June 12, 2016, that killed 49 people.

Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. Protesters who oppose the Capital Pride parade's corporate backing, which includes bank Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N, briefly blocked the parade route and forced it to be rerouted. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter. The parade in the heavily Democratic U.S. capital featured T-shirts that said “Love Trumps Hate,” an apparent reference to President Donald Trump. The Republican has voiced support for gay rights but his administration has revoked federal guidelines that let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. Damian Jessup, 30, who traveled from Norfolk, Virginia, to march with gay Republicans, defended Trump and his support for gays. “I lost a lot of friends when I came out as Republican,” said Jessup, who was wearing a Trump T-shirt. “It’s harder to come out as Republican than to come out as gay.” The Washington parade came a day ahead of a so-called Resist March in Los Angeles against Trump, which is taking the place of the annual pride parade. In San Francisco, the SF Weekly newspaper reported the parade in that city would include a “resistance contingent” and an immigrant rights speaker.

Trump and Jones began a relationship on Trump's campaign trail, and have peddled some of the same conspiracy theories, according to Mother Jones. Perhaps Trump's most popular conspiracy theory is that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States (he was), a theory also perpetuated by Jones.

In December 2015, Trump was a guest on Jones' show. Jones introduced Trump as ""a maverick"" who ""tells it like it is."" Jones opened the show by praising Trump for taking attacks from media outlets like the Washington Post and the New York Post. Jones theorizes that the attacks on 9/11 were a hoax; it was surprising that a Republican candidate would go on a show whose host postures that the previous Republican president was part of such an elaborate hoax.

At a January 2016 campaign event, Trump called Jones ""a nice guy.""

In February 2016, senior policy advisor to Trump Stephen Miller appeared on ""Info Wars,"" and repeatedly spoke to Jones' audience asking for support. ""If you want to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you want to close the border, if you want to protect American jobs and wages, then you have to support Donald J. Trump,"" Miller said.

""Hillary for prison"" became the rallying cry at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The phrase was initially found on merchandise on the ""Info Wars"" website. Jones was a ""special guest"" at the convention.

Also last August, Jones said on his show that he personally talked to Trump and encouraged him to push the idea that the election would be rigged. Trump did end up pushing this idea. ""I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged. I have to be honest,"" Trump said at an Ohio campaign stop.

239,http://theweek.com/articles/705134/trump-caesar,"Edward Gooch/Getty Images In 2012, the Acting Company and the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis mounted a production of Shakespeare's play, Julius Caesar set in the (then) present day, with an African-American actor playing Caesar in a manner clearly intended to evoke President Barack Obama, and the conspirators clearly intended to recall leading Republican legislators like Eric Cantor and Mitch McConnell. Now, for a few days, in the face of conservative outrage and the abandonment by key corporate sponsors, New Yorkers can go to Central Park to see the Public Theater's production of that same Roman tragedy, this time with an even more on-the-nose stand-in for President Donald Trump as the titular would-be dictator. You probably think I'm going to point out the hypocrisy of the outrage that has greeted the current production versus the indifference (far more typical for the theater) with which the production from five years ago was met. Or perhaps you think I'm going to do the opposite, and point out that with the victims of a politically-motivated mass shooting in Arlington still being treated for their wounds, now is emphatically not the time to be play-acting the murder of the president. But the play's the thing that might actually catch our conscience. So that's what I'm interested in. What was most interesting about the Obama-era Caesar was that it took the ideas of the conspirators seriously — because those small-r republican ideas have a legacy with considerable importance in American history. Some of the heirs to that history — like Patrick ""give me liberty or give me death"" Henry — we still honor. Others — like the actor John Wilkes Booth, who quoted Brutus when he killed President Lincoln — we abhor. A production that situated the Tea Party's rage against Obama within the context of that history had the potential to bring out important insights about that political moment, a potential that was substantially realized in that production. How well does this new production of Julius Caesar measure up to that standard? On the evidence of what I saw on Tuesday night, director Oskar Eustis is not so interested in the ideas behind the play as he is in the passions of the moment. But in exploring those passions, he digs up some uncomfortable truths about the much-sloganed ""resistance"" to the Trump regime — and sheds surprising light on the play itself. The first shock of the evening is that it makes any sense at all to hear Caesar's words coming out of Donald Trump's mouth. It's almost as disorienting as seeing Trump actually being the president. Shakespeare's Caesar has a firm sense of his own transcendent importance, the distance that separates him from even a noble Roman like Brutus. It is precisely this awesome majesty that incites Cassius' envy — he remembers that Caesar is but a man of flesh and blood, because he knew him before he was lord of all the world, and saw his frailty, and so he willfully refuses to accept his apotheosis. But put those same words in Trump's mouth, and no one — at least no one in a liberal New York audience — can hear Caesar the same way. What once was grand is now petty; what once was awesome is merely domineering. And we realize: The words only work if we feel the charisma of the man who utters them. This Caesar (played with broad humor by Gregg Henry) isn't even much of a tyrant — he's a shallow, vain, petulant man-child, strutting about, and embarrassing the senators even as the prospect of his kingship terrifies them. This works shockingly well, for all but Brutus' famous soliloquy in which he convinces himself to kill the tyrant. Corey Stoll does a masterful job in the part, giving Brutus a warmth I've rarely found in the clockwork conspirator, but the speech only works if you ignore the words, which are all about Caesar's ambition and a possible change in his character should he assume dictatorial powers, when we can all see that the problem is the character he already manifests. The contours of the political forces arrayed against this Trumpian Caesar are a bit fuzzy. It is surely no accident that the vast majority of the conspirators are African-American, including John Douglas Thompson's Cassius and Teagle F. Bougere's Casca, inaccurate a cross-section as that is of the American Senate. On the other hand, I probably over-read the costume design when I noted that the conspirators who approach Brutus at the top of the play are all wearing blue ties, while Brutus, like Caesar, wears red, suggesting — logically, in terms of his role in the play — that Brutus is a turncoat Republican (and Corey Stoll does bear a mild resemblance to Evan McMullin). Those ambiguities notwithstanding, the plausibility of the conspiracy, in emotional if not on practical terms, is the least shocking thing about the production. Trump, the conspiracy-monger-in-chief, has been the object of a prodigious industry of conspiratorial fantasy since before he even won the Republican nomination, from schemes to deny him a majority of the convention delegates, to dreams of faithless electors, to the current fantasy in which his own cabinet invokes the 25th Amendment and removes him for being unable to perform the duties of the office. Precisely because there is ample reason to be terrified of Trump in the Oval Office, pantomimes of assassination do not feel cathartic so much as desperate grasping at imaginary straws. And it is precisely this feeling of desperation and despair that the production drives home most forcefully. There has been much talk, including from the Public Theater itself, that the production was intended as a warning of the dangers of trying to defend democracy by undemocratic means — which it is, but without the comfort of suggesting that there might have been a better way through. Because this Caesar makes it plain that the resistance never had a chance. An almost universal problem with productions of Julius Caesar is the transition from conspiracy to civil war. This is a structural problem in the play, and it generally becomes more acute in modern-dress productions (unless they are set in modern-day Africa), because the prospect of such disorder is so remote. Eustis solves this problem by turning the conspirators' armies into a poorly-armed street rabble, and by putting the police on the side of Antony after the funeral oration (which deprives that oration of its apparent purpose of stirring up the populace to riot). The police even beat up poor Cinna the Poet. This is wildly contrary to the Roman situation — but it corresponds to the situation we actually face, in which the ""resistance"" to Trump has as few divisions as the Pope who Stalin famously dismissed. A patently foredoomed rebellion turns out to be more dramatically effective than a war whose outcome appears to hinge as much on circumstance as anything. In Shakespeare, Brutus and Cassius played their hand as best they could, knowing they needed to draw an inside straight, and never found their card. In this production, Brutus' call to ""take the current when it serves"" is blackly comical, when all he has to command are a flood of protesters who are easily mown down by regime goons with machine guns. The conspiracy failed to achieve regime change not merely because it made this or that tactical error, but because of a wild misunderstanding of the correlation of forces. The assassination, not merely as a play but within the world of the play, is a piece of theater first and foremost. And today's left, both mainstream and extreme, is rather enamored of the idea that theater is resistance, and theatrical violence is some of the most compelling theater. But that is all it is. The political terrorist who attempted to massacre a group of Republican congressmen and staffers playing baseball yesterday undoubtedly thought he was taking direct action to produce radical change. But he was just putting on a grisly show. And what about the grisly show on stage? I suspect a lot of the people in the audience when I attended were there precisely to show Delta Airlines and Bank of America, who abandoned the play, that they would not be cowed, as well they should. But the production as such will do nothing to change the fate of Donald Trump's presidency. Its only real effect will be how it changes those who saw it in terms of their understanding of the real workings of power. As for those who cry that it is irresponsible to depict the assassination of President Trump, I could reiterate, as my betters have already done, the manifold instances of such depictions in the past, and the litany of far more noble leaders who shrugged at the offense in much more dire circumstances. Instead, I will merely note that if there is one thing we should have learned from the rise of Donald Trump, it is that telling people there is something they cannot say, or think, or feel, is the surest way to give those feelings, thoughts, and words greater power, and those who voice them greater chance of achieving power, than they had had before.

240,https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/15/new-york-times-corrects-fake-news-editorial-blaming-sarah-palin-shooting/,"The New York Times issued an online correction Thursday to its lead editorial, which claimed that Sarah Palin had incited Jared Loughner to commit the mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011 that killed six and wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ). The editorial was a response to the shooting Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, in which gunman James T. Hodgkinson targeted Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice. Four players were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), who remains in the hospital in critical condition. Originally, the Times article, “America’s Lethal Politics,” had stated: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. It also added that “there’s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack” in Wednesday’s shooting. As Breitbart News explained Wednesday evening, after the editorial was published online, all of the Times‘ factual claims above were false. Now, the article reads: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl. At the time, we and others were sharply critical of the heated political rhetoric on the right. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. But in that case no connection to the shooting was ever established. A correction now appears at the bottom of the article: Correction: June 15, 2017 
An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. The Times came under intense criticism in conservative media for its “fake news” editorial. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

241,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/06/19/tourist-streams-mass-shootout-myrtle-beach-facebook-live/,"A tourist used Facebook Live to stream a mass shooting that took place in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, early on Sunday.  The shootout reportedly took place after a fight broke out, prompting one suspect to draw his gun. Several people were injured in the shooting. The Facebook Live video (WARNING GRAPHIC) quickly gained popularity, receiving over 4 million views, 26,000 comments, and nearly 100,000 shares. “In the recording, taken by Bubba Hinson, from Bethune, South Carolina, who appears to be on a balcony at a nearby hotel, more than a dozen shots can be heard,” reported the Daily Mail. “Lt Crosby said an armed security officer witnessed the shooting and shot the suspect. The alleged shooter then shot numerous rounds and escaped the scene by carjacking a vehicle, police confirmed.” “Police officers found the stolen vehicle and have identified and apprehended a suspect in the case, according to Lt Crosby,” they continued. “His identity is being withheld, however, until he is cleared medically and warrants are served.” Myrtle Beach Mayor John Rhodes expressed disappointment in the fact that the shootout had become viral online, Sunday. “Social media today puts this word out quickly… It does not look good for the city of Myrtle Beach,” he declared. “We’re gonna send a message to do everything that’s humanly possible to stop this violence in our city… I’m sorry for our city that this happened.” One tourist who was vacationing in the area at the time vowed never to visit again. “Y’all…for real, I’m never vacationing with my family at Myrtle Beach again,” declared Sabrina Nero on Facebook. “We all had a great time, but I felt like they should have been wearing a bullet proof vest under their bathing suits. Last night around midnight, Bo Kelly and I took a walk on the beach once the kids were asleep and we had a sitter and when we returned back to the hotel…there was a man with gunshot wounds that had just shot at a crowd and jacked a car…and somehow ended up driving to the front entrance of our hotel.” “This is not the myrtle beach I remember from my childhood at all,” she concluded. https://www.facebook.com/sabrinanero/posts/10213967037188816?pnref=story In May, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he would be hiring 3,000 new employees to sort through violent content on the platform, following a spike in video suicides and murders on the site. “We know we need to do better,” said the company in a statement following numerous incidents, which included the revelation that one murder video had been on the platform for hours before removal. In the same month, a man set fire to himself live on Facebook before running into a bar, while police officers also managed to save a teenager from a suicide attempt which was being filmed live on the platform. In April, an Alabama man live streamed his suicide on Facebook Live following a relationship breakup, while a Thai father also streamed himself hanging his 11-month-old child before killing himself. In January, four people were arrested in Chicago after they filmed themselves on Facebook Live torturing and beating a tied up disabled man, who was repeatedly forced to say, “f*ck Trump,” and, “f*ck white people.” On Easter Sunday, Facebook user Steve Stephens filmed himself shooting and killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. before he evaded police for days – eventually committing suicide in a standoff.

          / CBS News ORLANDO -- Names of the 49 people who died at the Pulse nightclub were read aloud Monday, a year after America's worst mass shooting in history. Two days after the Pulse massacre, Demetrice Naulings told CBS News' Scott Pelley about the mayhem inside. ""A girl gets shot. Right behind me.  And she falls on the floor,"" Naulings said. Holding back tears, he added, ""You could hear the bullets drop. I even heard the clip fall on the floor for him to just reload again. And then the ring of shots just keep going."" Naulings and his best friend Eddie Justice had walked in at 2 a.m. for last call. The next person to enter the club was gunman Omar Mateen. A year later, Naulings still relives the unthinkable, and opened up to CBS News. ""It was only when you got outside and you said, 'Where's Eddie?'"" we asked. ""Right. Realizing he was not behind me,"" Naulings recalled. Asked if he still hears those shots, he said, ""I hear it all the time… because I'm always afraid that, 'Am I next?'"" Justice was killed. He was a 30-year-old tax accountant, a jokester and Wilhemina Justice's only son. ""He was smart. He was loving… he was my world,"" Wilhemina told CBS News. Eddie, wounded and hiding in a bathroom, texted his mother. ""It was 2:06 when I got the first text saying, 'I love you momma' … and he was saying, 'Tell them to hurry up. I'm gonna die.' That was it … 2:39, last text,"" she said. ""I grieve every moment. Some days are better than others… and some days are just not good at all,"" Wilhemina said as she cleared her throat. ""I'll never be who I was a year ago."" Justice and Naulings have a special connection. They find comfort in each other. ""I got Demetrice, you know?"" she said. ""I can't imagine what he goes through. But I love this guy. I love him."" And make no mistake, something similar in Orlando came alive after all the carnage. ""You feel the love here. It's not just Disney World and SeaWorld and Universal Studios anymore. Now it's about Orlando Strong,"" Naulings said. First published on June 12, 2017 / 8:21 PM © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

246,https://theconversation.com/charlottesville-attack-shows-homegrown-terror-on-the-right-is-on-the-rise-78242,"Director of Security Studies and Professor, University of Massachusetts Lowell Arie Perliger has received funding from the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy at West Point.  University of Massachusetts provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list The attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a man named James Alex Fields Jr. used his Dodge Challenger as a weapon against a crowd of protesters, underscores the growing violence of America’s far-right wing. According to reports, Fields was a active member of an online far-right community. Like many other far-right activists, he believes that he represents a wider ideological community, even though he acted alone. My 15 years experience of studying violent extremism in Western societies has taught me that dealing effectively with far-right violence requires treating its manifestations as domestic terrorism. In the wake of the Charlottesville attack, the Department of Justice announced it would launch a federal investigation: “…that kind of violence, committed for seeming political ends, is the very definition of domestic terrorism.” This acknowledgment may signal that a growing domestic menace may finally get the attention it deserves. While attacks by outsider Jihadist groups will probably continue, domestic terrorism still deserves more attention than it’s getting. Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare. Most terrorist groups lack the resources, expertise and manpower to defeat state actors. Instead, they promote their agenda through violence that shapes perceptions of political and social issues. Fields’ attack, if it was motivated by racist sentiments, should be treated as an act of domestic terrorism. Here I define domestic terrorism as the use of violence in a political and social context that aims to send a message to a broader target audience. Like lynching, cross-burning and vandalizing religious sites, incidents of this kind deliberately aim to terrorize people of color and non-Christians. I consider domestic terrorism a more significant threat than the foreign-masterminded variety, in part because the number of domestic terror attacks on U.S. soil is greater. For example, my report published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point identified hundreds of domestic terror incidents taking place between 2008 and 2012. Another report, published in 2014 by New America Foundation on domestic incidents of extremist violence, shows that excluding the Orlando nightclub massacre, between 2002-2016, far-right affiliated perpetrators conducted 18 attacks that killed 48 people in the United States. Meanwhile, terrorists motivated by al-Qaida’s or the Islamic State’s ideology killed 45 people in nine attacks. The Orlando mass shooting, given its mix of apparent motives, is difficult to categorize. In briefings with law enforcement and policymakers, I have sometimes encountered a tendency to see U.S. right-wing extremists as a monolith. But traditional Ku Klux Klan chapters operate differently than skinhead groups, as do anti-government “patriot” and militia groups and anti-abortion extremists. Christian Identity groups, which believe Anglo-Saxons and other people of Northern European descent are a chosen people, are distinct too. Certainly, there is some overlap. But these groups also differ significantly in terms of their recruitment styles, ideologies and whether and how they use violence. Across the board, undermining the threat they pose requires a more sophisticated approach than investigating their criminal acts as suspected hate crimes. In an ongoing study I’m conducting at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with several students, we have determined that, as it seems to be also in the case of Fields, many attacks inspired by racist or xenophobic sentiments are spontaneous. That is, no one plans them in advance or targets the victim ahead of time. Instead, chance encounters that enrage the perpetrators trigger these incidents. Sporadic attacks with high numbers of casualties that are plotted in advance, such as Dylann Roof’s murder of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina church, are always big news. More typical incidents of far-right violence tend to draw less attention. The fatal stabbing of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Rick Best aboard a train in Portland, Oregon on May 26 seems to be no exception. The alleged killer of these two white men, Jeremy Joseph Christian, attacked them with a knife after they stood up to him for haranguing two young women who appeared to be Muslim, police said. A third injured passenger, Micahel  Fletcher, has survived. Much of the media coverage is focused on Christian’s violent and racist background. Given the spontaneous nature of so much far-right violence, U.S. counterterrorism policies should, in my view, target the dissemination of white supremacist ideology, rather than just identifying planned attacks and monitoring established white supremacy groups. The number of violent attacks on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology has spiked since the beginning of this century, rising from a yearly average of 70 attacks in the 1990s to a yearly average of more than 300 since 2001.  These incidents have grown even more common since President Donald Trump’s election. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that researches U.S. extremism, reported 900 bias-related incidents against minorities in the first 10 days after Trump’s election – compared to several dozen in a normal week – and found that many of the harassers invoked the then-president-elect’s name. Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that tracks anti-Semitism,  recorded an 86 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the first three months of 2017. Beyond the terror that victimized communities are experiencing, I would argue that this trend reflects a deeper social change in American society. The iceberg model of political extremism, initially developed by Ehud Shprinzak, an Israeli political scientist, can illuminate these dynamics. Murders and other violent attacks perpetrated by U.S. far-right extremists compose the visible tip of an iceberg. The rest of this iceberg is under water and out of sight. It includes hundreds of attacks every year that damage property and intimidate communities, such as the attempted burning in May of an African-American family’s garage in Schodack, New York. The garage was also defaced with racist graffiti. Data my team collected at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point show that the significant growth in far-right violence in recent years is happening at the base of the iceberg. While the main reasons for that are still not clear, it is important to remember that changes in societal norms are usually reflected in behavioral changes. Hence, it is more than reasonable to suspect that extremist individuals engage in such activities because they sense that their views are enjoying growing social legitimacy and acceptance, which is emboldening them to act on their bigotry. Despite an uptick in far-right violence and the Trump administration’s plan unveiled earlier this year to increase the Department of Homeland Security budget by 6.7 percent to US$44.1 billion in 2018, the White House also proposed to cut spending for programs that fight non-Muslim domestic terrorism. The federal government has also frozen $10 million in grants aimed at countering domestic violent extremism. This approach is bound to weaken the authorities’ power to monitor far-right groups, undercutting public safety. How many more innocent people like Heather Heyer, who was killed in Fields’ attack – and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Rick Best in Seattle – have to die before the U.S. government starts taking the threat posed by violent white supremacists more seriously? This is an updated version of an article originally published on May 28, 2017. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

Jeff Flake of Arizona was unhurt in a gunman's attack Wednesday on a Republican congressional baseball practice in suburban Washington, D.C., and was able to describe the shooter and the scene. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the GOP whip, was wounded as were two U.S. Capitol police officers and a congressional aide. Talking to reporters, Flake said Scalise ""dragged himself about 15 yards"" after being shot at second base on the field in Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, in an upscale area of Alexandria, Va. Flake told reporters that the shooter was wearing a blue shirt and confirmed that the shooter had been shot by police. ""It looks like only one shooter, so you've got to assume he knew what he was doing here,"" Flake said. ""Whether he was targeting certain members, we don't know."" Flake added that he took Scalise's phone and called Scalise's wife. ""I just didn't want her to wake up and hear the news and not know what was going on,"" Flake said. In a telephone interview with The Arizona Republic, Flake provided more details of the incident. He said the GOP team was doing batting practice when the shooting began. ""We heard one shot and didn't recognize it or weren't sure it was a shot, didn't see where it was coming from but it was very loud and it sounded like a gunshot,"" Flake told The Republic. ""And then, just a few seconds, just a rally of gunfire and it was clear what it was."" The lawmakers on the field still couldn't tell where the bullets were coming from, he said. ""He was, I think, kind of shielded by the other dugout,"" Flake said. ""A bunch of us dived into the first-base dugout."" Several minutes later, the injured staff member made it to the dugout and they ""applied pressure"" to his wound, Flake said. Just met with Capitol Police officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey at the hospital. Thanked them for saving my life. ""I kept popping up to try to see, because I didn't know if he had taken out our security detail, who was behind us,"" Flake said. ""For a while, our security detail was firing and I didn't know if it was friendly. I kept yelling, 'Are you friendly? Are you friendly?' And he yelled back, 'Yes.' And I saw that it was Steve Scalise's detail. He happened to be at the practice, thankfully, or we wouldn't have had a detail. (As a member of House GOP leadership) he's the only one who has one."" Flake described who he believes was the alleged gunman, identified by authorities as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill., this way: ""He was middle-aged. I would have guessed 40s or 50s. Just a blue shirt and jeans and I think dark hair. Nothing distinguishing that I remember seeing. I thought, that's got to be the gunman. I didn't even see the weapon at that point."" Flake provided more details in a written account issued by his office. ""Flake was standing along the first base line when the gunman opened fire. As the gunman and Capitol Police exchanged gunfire, Flake took cover in the dugout,"" Flake's statement said. ""While in the dugout, Flake helped treat one aide who, after being shot in the leg near center field, managed to get into the dugout. Flake estimates more than 50 shots were fired. Immediately after the gunfire stopped, Flake ran onto the field and began to apply pressure on Congressman Steve Scalise’s (R-La.) wound. After medical personnel arrived, Flake retrieved Scalise’s phone and made the first call to Scalise’s wife to notify her of the shooting. He did to ensure that Mrs. Scalise would not find out about the shooting through the media."" After the shooting, Flake received telephone calls from former President Barack Obama and Vice President Mike Pence, his office confirmed. In an interview with Phoenix radio station KFYI-AM (550), Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., decried what he described as a hateful climate toward members of Congress. Schweikert recently was criticized by activist groups for suggesting in a fundraising letter that the groups promote violence. Members of the groups took to Twitter in force to push back on the allegation that they are violent. Schweikert said ""left-wing radicals"" have even written ""hate"" toward his 20-month daughter and he has had interns quit because they didn't want to take verbal abuse on the phone. ""This is actually really just the last three months,"" Schweikert said. ""Look, I used to be the county tax collector, you know, county treasurer. I would get some crazy stuff there. There's nothing like the last three months. Nothing."" My heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police- public servants and heroes today and every day. In 2011, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., was shot and nearly killed in a mass shooting near Tucson at one of her constituent events. On Wednesday, Giffords tweeted: ""My heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police- public servants and heroes today and every day.""

By playing tonight, you are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence, or assaults on our democracy,” Trump said in the video. The annual game took place a day after a mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice that left Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) in critical condition. The president said he sent his thoughts and prayers to Scalise and his family: “Steve is our friend. He’s a patriot and he’s a true fighter.” “In Washington we have our disagreements, but we all agree that we are here to serve this nation we love and the people who call it home,” Trump said. “That’s the source of our unity. … The game will go on.” Democrats and Republicans came together for a moment of prayer before the first pitch, which was thrown out by David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was among several other people injured in the shooting Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia. Greeted by cheers from the audience at Nationals Park, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle shook hands and patted each other on the backs before kneeling for a prayer for the wounded, led by House of Representatives Chaplain Patrick Conroy. In a joint CNN interview with Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, both lawmakers said they were close friends of Scalise's. “Tonight we’re all team Scalise,” Pelosi said, as the ballgame continued in the background. By RACHAEL BADE Ryan called for members of Congress to “tone down the rhetoric” and be open to their constituents. “It's a tough age. It's partisan, polarized country. What we need to do is tone down the rhetoric and lead by example and show people we can disagree with one another and have different ideas without being vitriolic and going to such extremes,” Ryan said in the interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper. “That’s what we're trying to demonstrate.” Pelosi, however, pushed back when Tapper asked her whether the discourse on the left was demonizing Trump too much. “No. I think the person who perpetrated the crime yesterday has. People feel very strongly in their convictions,” Pelosi said. Missing out on the latest scoops?

251,http://abcnews.go.com/US/hours-body-camera-footage-orlando-nightclub-shooting-released/story?id=47753356&quot,"The Orlando police released 11 hours of new body camera footage on Wednesday. New body camera footage shows chaos, carnage inside Pulse nightclub: Part 1 — -- The Orlando Police Department released 11 hours of new body camera footage on Wednesday from inside the Pulse nightclub on the night of the worst mass shooting in modern American history, almost one year ago. The footage contains dramatic scenes of chaos and carnage as first responders tried to save the wounded and hunt down the shooter, who killed 49 people in the name of the Islamic State. In a series of interviews before the release of the footage, broadcast Wednesday on ""World News Tonight With David Muir"" and ""Nightline,"" first responders and survivors told ABC News that the memories of that night and the emotions stirred by them are still raw. “Several of us commented that this was going to change the city forever,” said Roger Brennan, the police department’s commander on the scene, “and probably change what we do forever.” By early Saturday, June 12, it had already been a violent weekend in Orlando. Little more than 24 hours earlier, a young singer named Christina Grimmie was shot and killed while signing autographs for fans after her performance at the nearby Plaza Live theater. That Saturday, Pulse, a popular spot for the city’s gay community, was packed with patrons, many of them young revelers eager to forget the previous night’s tragedy. “We were all in a great mood,” said Jahqui Sevilla, a young woman who was at the club with friends. “We were in the club dancing. It was, like, one of the best nights I had — that turned into the worst day of my life.” Just after 2:00 a.m., a man named Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American-born son of Afghan immigrants, entered the club, armed with a military-style assault rifle, and opened fire. A security guard from Port St. Lucie, Florida, he was an angry and troubled man with a history of violence and failure. An off-duty police detective working security at Pulse radioed in, and less than a minute and a half later, backup units began to arrive. One officer, Graham Cage, heard the call and jumped on his bicycle. He ran into the club while everyone else was running out. “I had a helmet, but a bicycle helmet,” Cage said. “It’s not going to do a whole lot with that.” As patrons rushed for the exits, the shooter rapidly fired shots in the club. The bullets missed Sevilla but hit the two friends she was standing with, one fatally. “He had a gunshot wound to his chest,” she said. “That’s when I saw that he was injured. He was nonresponsive.” The first responding officers returned fire, forcing the shooter to retreat farther into the club. As those officers pursued him, they passed dead and wounded people everywhere. Police training calls for officers to head straight to an active shooter, even if it means ignoring victims. “A person reached up and asked for help, but at that point, we didn’t know where the shooter was, if he was detained, if he was deceased or what was going on,” said Kyle Medvetz, one of the officers who responded. “So, as much as I wanted to help, I could not help him until we know for sure the shooter was detained, contained or deceased.” The shooter barricaded himself in a bathroom with several hostages — which, according to Maj. Mark Canty, who led the Orlando SWAT team, required the police to change their strategy. “This went quickly, very, very quickly from an active shooter to what we call a barricaded gunman to a hostage situation,” he said. The shooter was still inside, cornered and dangerous, but rather than immediately storm the building, Canty decided to wait. It was a decision that some would later criticize, as it would take three more hours for police to gain full control and get all the wounded to safety. Chief John Mina, in the command post, however, said it was the right call. “During that whole three hours, we were in there saving people from the dance floor, from dressing rooms, from the other bathroom,” he said. “We took 22 people out of the front bathroom. Once we were inside that club, there were no more gunshots until the final assault.” Half an hour after he first opened fire, the shooter called the Orlando Police Department dispatch center. “I want to let you know I’m in Orlando and I did the shooting,” Mateen said. “I pledge my allegiance to Baghdadi on behalf of the Islamic State,” referring to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS. Sgt. Andy Brennan, a trained hostage negotiator, was working an off-duty detail at a bar downtown that night when he responded to the radio call from Pulse and headed to the dispatch center. He engaged the shooter over multiple phone calls, listening to his rants about ISIS and Syria. “You need to stop the U.S. airstrikes,” Mateen said. “They need to stop the U.S. airstrikes, OK?” Meanwhile, officers used the time to get as many victims out as possible, despite concerns that the shooter might attempt to hide among the victims. Officer James Hyland arrived in his personal pickup truck, which a partner quickly turned into a makeshift ambulance. “We didn’t have any ambulances or anything there. He just started loading people up,” Hyland said. “And he was just going back and forth, doing one run after another after another after another.” Trapped victims who could not be reached used their cellphones to call loved ones, who then called 911 to plead for help on their behalf. “My girlfriend’s in the bathroom,” said one caller. “There are now four dead in the bathroom, and two more are bleeding out. If somebody doesn’t get there soon, they’re going to die.” “Yes, my son is shot in the club in the Pulse in Orlando, and he’s still in the bathroom, where he’s bleeding,” said a sobbing mother. “He got shot, and nobody’s going in for him.” The rescue operation continued until Andy Brennan, the negotiator, heard words from the shooter that quickly changed the dynamic for everyone in the nightclub. “By the way, there is some vehicles outside that have some bombs, just to let you know,” Mateen said. “Your people are going to get it, and I’m going to ignite it if they try to do anything stupid.” He escalated the threat, saying he had “a vest,” before abruptly hanging up. “When you start talking about explosives,” said Roger Brennan, the scene commander, “now you have to pull your resources back.” The information circulated among the officers on scene, but not a single officer pulled back to safety. “We were in it to win it, you know?” Medvetz said. “And we didn’t want to leave.” Instead, the police prepared to move in. With victims still trapped inside the nightclub and the suspect threatening to set off explosives, Andy Brennan knew he was running out of time. In his fourth and final phone call with Mateen, Brennan tried again to persuade him to come out of the nightclub without his weapons, but after making his demands, Mateen hung up. It was after that call that Mina decided his officers would have to storm the back bathrooms of the nightclub. “I wasn’t going to sit here in this command post and hear that explosion, knowing that he was going to blow up everyone, all those hostages inside that club, because there were many hostages left inside,” he said. After getting Mina’s go order, the SWAT team moved toward the back bathrooms, where they knew hostages were hiding. “They said, ‘Hey, we’re going to push the air conditioning unit in, but before we do, you guys have to catch it because if you let it drop or make any noise, the killer is going to know where you’re at, and he might shoot through the walls and kill you,’” said Canty. He said the hostages reached up to grab the air-conditioning unit when it was pushed in and were able to set it down without making a sound. Eight hostages were able to escape through that opening, police said. “I think the first person that came out was the person that was injured,” Canty said. “They were able to get out by themselves.” In a different area of the nightclub, Jahqui Sevilla also made her escape, carrying her friend who was shot in the chest. He later died from his injuries. Her father, Benigno Sevilla, an Orlando firefighter, was waiting outside for her. “I give her a quick once-over, make sure she has all her body parts,” he said. “I knew she was one of those who could be killed or injured.” “It wasn’t until he was there and I knew that I could kind of just, like, collapse in his arms and I would be OK,” Jahqui Sevilla said. After the air-conditioning unit was out, police decided to move forward with their final assault. Officer Rob Woodyard drove an armored vehicle called a BearCat toward the nightclub and tore open a hole in a wall to create an escape route. SWAT team members pulled hostages to safety as they ran out. “Every person we got out was a victory for us,” Woodyard said. “At that point, we know that we need to get these people out this building. So one by one, they’re coming out of these holes, and it’s a great feeling, seeing them come out.” Even with the BearCat, officers said, they were still being cautious because Mateen said there were explosives. Canty said there was also a concern that Mateen would start firing on the hostages as they ran out, and they knew people were still trapped in a back bathroom. “You’re trying to save as many people as you can,” Canty said. “There’s 13 people in that bathroom. You want to save them. There’s five with him.” But the plan worked. Once the BearCat came through the wall, police said, Mateen stepped out into the open and started firing on the officers and the BearCat. “It was just, like, a wall of freedom,” said Michael Ragsdale, another officer who responded. “There was 30 seconds of just the most awesome sound you could hear, because it was us returning fire towards him.” During the shootout with Mateen, Mina said, a bullet struck Officer Michael Napolitano’s helmet. If it had been an inch lower, Mina said, Napolitano “would have been dead.” But instead, Mina said, the officer “went down to the ground still returning fire, and the other officers returned fire, killing the suspect.” When the call went out over the police radios that the suspect was dead, Andy Brennan said, a “giant cheer went up” inside the command center. “We all hollered, ‘Yay!’” said Bill Hammer, a dispatcher. “It was a big uproar.” After hours of fighting, the massacre was finally over, but the officers involved felt there was little to celebrate. Mina said he and many of the officers were heartbroken by what happened. “I was very proud of the police response, but still, you know, this person went in and killed 49 of our community members,” he said. “And so as a community, we were devastated.” Editor’s note: Jahqui Sevilla was killed early Monday in a car crash.

Ace of Spades and I went at it Wednesday afternoon about this. I completely understand his view that turn about is fair play, and that because so many individuals on the Left have argued that heated rhetoric on the right spurs violence, now they deserve a taste of their own medicine.

	But here’s the problem. I don’t think that talk radio made the Oklahoma City bombing happen, I don’t think violent video games made Columbine happen, I don’t think Sarah Palin’s Facebook page made the Tuscon shooter take his actions, and I don’t think crazy rumors posted on Facebook made that guy bring a gun into that Adams Morgan pizzeria. In each of those cases, an individual made the conscious choice to set off a bomb or pick up a gun and shoot at people. I think blaming these outside forces amounts to letting the perpetrator off the hook for his own actions and scapegoats a politically convenient target.

	One of the sharper bits of social commentary on this topic came in the cinematic, er, classic, Scream 2, where a murderous film student boasts: “I’ve got my whole defense planned out. I’m going to blame the movies… Can you see it? The effects of cinema violence on society! I’ll get Dershowitz or Cochran to represent me. Bob Dole on the witness stand in my defense. Hell, the Christian Coalition will pay my legal fees. It’s airtight, Sid. I’m an innocent victim.”

We didn’t think that conservative political rhetoric incites violence, so why should we contend that liberal political rhetoric incites violence, unless we just really enjoy embracing hypocrisy? I should be fair to Ace’s argument; he thinks that if the Right applies the same standard to the Left, the Left will realize how unfair and unjust it is to be blamed for a crime you had nothing to do with, and abandon the belief that political rhetoric incites violence. If I thought it would work, I would be more supportive. I think the more likely outcome is that the Left takes this argument on the Right as concurrence, and moves to restrict political rhetoric, particularly that of conservatives, because of the now bipartisan agreement that rhetoric incites violence.

Advertisement Of course, then this morning the New York Times editorial board insisted “the link to political incitement was clear” in Tucson and “there’s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack”, even though the shooter was a paranoid schizophrenic who believed that grammar was part of a vast government conspiracy for mind control. Fine. If that’s the way the game is going to be played, if prominent liberal voices are going to blame political perspectives even in situations where it has been proven as a non-factor in a court of law, then go get them, Ace.

 Two: The Double Standard on Political Violence

 Second, there has been a double standard on how our society deals with politically-motivated violence, and while there is so far nothing indicating this is a primary cause of the awful crime committed Wednesday, it is dangerous to cultivate a perception that certain kinds of political violence are justified or less wrong.

Advertisement In light of Wednesday’s shooting, does anyone want to revisit the government and university response to violent mobs on Berkeley’s and Middlebury’s campuses? At Middlebury College, the administration punished 67 students with consequences “ranging from probation to official college discipline, which places a permanent record in the student’s file.” That sounds somewhat serious, but remember what actually happened when Charles Murray visited campus:


		Most of the hatred was focused on Dr. Murray, but when I took his right arm to shield him and to make sure we stayed together, the crowd turned on me. Someone pulled my hair, while others were shoving me. I feared for my life. Once we got into the car, protesters climbed on it, hitting the windows and rocking the vehicle whenever we stopped to avoid harming them. I am still wearing a neck brace, and spent a week in a dark room to recover from a concussion caused by the whiplash.

	In Berkeley, only one person was arrested during a violent riot, and police were explicitly told to have a ‘hands off’ approach:


		Only one person was arrested in the mayhem that injured six people — prompting criticism of training for campus police at the entire University of California system that emphasizes officer restraint and patience during protests in the name of protecting students’ free speech rights.

		“The UC ‘hands-off’ approach was to the citizens’ detriment and the officers’ detriment in this situation,” said John Bakhit, a lawyer for the union representing about 400 of the system’s police officers.

		Officers should have been given more discretion to prevent the vandalism and violence and make arrests at the Berkeley protest, Bakhit said.

		“The frustrating thing for the police officers is that they weren’t allowed to do their jobs,” he said.

If universities and local police authorities are unwilling to address violent students and protesters, doesn’t that fuel the perception that some sorts of politically based violence are acceptable?

	How about when The Nation runs a piece calling the sucker-punch of Richard Spencer “pure kinetic beauty”? Violence against people you disagree with is okay, as long as the target’s views are odious enough? Is that the new rule? Because I’ll bet there are plenty of people that find the views of The Nation editors odious.

 Three: Why Are We Always Hearing About Red Flags When It’s Too Late?

	Third, preventing future attacks like this requires less in the realm of adjusting political rhetoric and a lot more in the realm of getting law enforcement, the judicial system, and other authority figures to take violent and threatening behavior seriously before it escalates to a mass shooting. The Alexandria shooter is just the latest in an abominable string of shooters and dangerous criminals who have committed multiple serious felonies and raised one red flag after another, only to be ignored by “the system.”


		Hodgkinson was the foster the father of at least two girls. The first, Wanda Ashley Stock, 17, committed suicide in 1996 by pouring gasoline on herself and setting herself on fire after a few months of living with the Hodgkinsons, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. The Hodgkinsons gave an interview to the paper after her suicide, calling her a “very practical, level-headed girl.”

		Privacy laws do not allow the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to release foster records.

		In 2002, Hodgkinson became the foster father of another girl whom he allegedly abused, according to police record.

		In 2006, he was arrested for domestic battery and discharge of a firearm after he stormed into a neighbor’s home where his teenage foster daughter was visiting with a friend. In a skirmish, he punched his foster daughter’s then 19-year-old friend Aimee Moreland “in the face with a closed fist,” according to a police report reviewed by The Daily Beast. When Moreland’s boyfriend walked outside of the residence where Moreland and Hodgkinson’s foster daughter were, he allegedly aimed a shotgun at the boyfriend and later fired one round. The Hodgkinsons later lost custody of that foster daughter.

		“[Hodgkinson] fired a couple of warning shots and then hit my boyfriend with the butt of the gun,” Moreland told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

		Hodgkinson was also “observed throwing” his daughter “around the bedroom,” the police report said. After the girl broke free, Hodgkinson followed and “started hitting her arms, pulling her hair, and started grabbing her off the bed.”

		Moreland said Hodgkinson’s daughter “told me a lot of stories that he was really awful to her.”

		“According to his foster daughter, he was always angry,” Moreland said. “She was really unhappy there. She had come over to get away from them.”

		When Moreland tried escaping with Hodgkinson’s daughter in a vehicle, Hodgkinson reached inside and “turned off the ignition,” the report said.

		“We were panicked and when I tried to reverse, I hit neutral instead and he opened my car door and hit me, and then came to her car door and pulled out a knife and cut her seatbelt and dragged her out,” Moreland said. “She was only 15 or 16, I think. She was so tiny.”…

		At court, Hodgkinson was no less angry. Moreland said that at an initial court appearance, Hodgkinson had to be removed from the courtroom after a series of eruptions.

		“Every time the judge would talk to me, he would have an outburst and start screaming,” Moreland said.

		The charges were dismissed, Moreland said, after she got her dates “mixed up” and failed to appear on time for a second court date.

		In June 2006, police were dispatched to Hodgkinson’s home in response to a domestic dispute that began when Hodgkinson allegedly hit a woman’s dog while it slept in her driveway, according to a sheriff’s report.

	Gun control? How about we start with trying some violent-maniac control?

	Hell of a job, legal system. When a guy like this slips through the cracks time and time again, it is amazing that this world doesn’t have more Frank Castle–like vigilantes. This is not an endorsement of vigilantism, merely an observation that if you see the criminal justice system completely fumble its duty to protect the innocent and powerless… how do you think people are going to respond?

 ADDENDA: Bad timing for a dyspeptic mood; I’m supposed to tell a room full of fourth-graders at Authenticity Woods Elementary School what I do all day.

	But the good news is after a long, unavoidable hiatus, a new edition of the pop culture podcast is on its way later this week!

Loading... If universities and local police authorities are unwilling to address violent students and protesters, doesn’t that fuel the perception that some sorts of politically based violence are acceptable? How about when The Nation runs a piece calling the sucker-punch of Richard Spencer “pure kinetic beauty”? Violence against people you disagree with is okay, as long as the target’s views are odious enough? Is that the new rule? Because I’ll bet there are plenty of people that find the views of The Nation editors odious.

 Three: Why Are We Always Hearing About Red Flags When It’s Too Late?

	Third, preventing future attacks like this requires less in the realm of adjusting political rhetoric and a lot more in the realm of getting law enforcement, the judicial system, and other authority figures to take violent and threatening behavior seriously before it escalates to a mass shooting. The Alexandria shooter is just the latest in an abominable string of shooters and dangerous criminals who have committed multiple serious felonies and raised one red flag after another, only to be ignored by “the system.”


		Hodgkinson was the foster the father of at least two girls. The first, Wanda Ashley Stock, 17, committed suicide in 1996 by pouring gasoline on herself and setting herself on fire after a few months of living with the Hodgkinsons, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. The Hodgkinsons gave an interview to the paper after her suicide, calling her a “very practical, level-headed girl.”

		Privacy laws do not allow the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to release foster records.

Advertisement Third, preventing future attacks like this requires less in the realm of adjusting political rhetoric and a lot more in the realm of getting law enforcement, the judicial system, and other authority figures to take violent and threatening behavior seriously before it escalates to a mass shooting. The Alexandria shooter is just the latest in an abominable string of shooters and dangerous criminals who have committed multiple serious felonies and raised one red flag after another, only to be ignored by “the system.” Hodgkinson was the foster the father of at least two girls. The first, Wanda Ashley Stock, 17, committed suicide in 1996 by pouring gasoline on herself and setting herself on fire after a few months of living with the Hodgkinsons, the Belleville News-Democrat reports. The Hodgkinsons gave an interview to the paper after her suicide, calling her a “very practical, level-headed girl.”

		Privacy laws do not allow the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to release foster records.

		In 2002, Hodgkinson became the foster father of another girl whom he allegedly abused, according to police record.

		In 2006, he was arrested for domestic battery and discharge of a firearm after he stormed into a neighbor’s home where his teenage foster daughter was visiting with a friend. In a skirmish, he punched his foster daughter’s then 19-year-old friend Aimee Moreland “in the face with a closed fist,” according to a police report reviewed by The Daily Beast. When Moreland’s boyfriend walked outside of the residence where Moreland and Hodgkinson’s foster daughter were, he allegedly aimed a shotgun at the boyfriend and later fired one round. The Hodgkinsons later lost custody of that foster daughter.

		“[Hodgkinson] fired a couple of warning shots and then hit my boyfriend with the butt of the gun,” Moreland told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

		Hodgkinson was also “observed throwing” his daughter “around the bedroom,” the police report said. After the girl broke free, Hodgkinson followed and “started hitting her arms, pulling her hair, and started grabbing her off the bed.”

		Moreland said Hodgkinson’s daughter “told me a lot of stories that he was really awful to her.”

		“According to his foster daughter, he was always angry,” Moreland said. “She was really unhappy there. She had come over to get away from them.”

		When Moreland tried escaping with Hodgkinson’s daughter in a vehicle, Hodgkinson reached inside and “turned off the ignition,” the report said.

		“We were panicked and when I tried to reverse, I hit neutral instead and he opened my car door and hit me, and then came to her car door and pulled out a knife and cut her seatbelt and dragged her out,” Moreland said. “She was only 15 or 16, I think. She was so tiny.”…

Gun control? How about we start with trying some violent-maniac control?

	Hell of a job, legal system. When a guy like this slips through the cracks time and time again, it is amazing that this world doesn’t have more Frank Castle–like vigilantes. This is not an endorsement of vigilantism, merely an observation that if you see the criminal justice system completely fumble its duty to protect the innocent and powerless… how do you think people are going to respond?

 ADDENDA: Bad timing for a dyspeptic mood; I’m supposed to tell a room full of fourth-graders at Authenticity Woods Elementary School what I do all day.

	But the good news is after a long, unavoidable hiatus, a new edition of the pop culture podcast is on its way later this week!

Loading... Hell of a job, legal system. When a guy like this slips through the cracks time and time again, it is amazing that this world doesn’t have more Frank Castle–like vigilantes. This is not an endorsement of vigilantism, merely an observation that if you see the criminal justice system completely fumble its duty to protect the innocent and powerless… how do you think people are going to respond?

No charge. © 2021 National Review Newsletters © 2021 National Review",2017-06-15 08:13:41,"After Alexandria, We Have a Lot to Talk about, America | National Review",,1117,http://www.nationalreview.com/
253,https://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2017/06/15/james-hodgkinson-the-face-of-hate-and-a-member-of-the-resistance-n2341400,"On June 14, a man opened fire on a group of Republican politicians and staffers who were practicing for Congress’s annual baseball game. Before doing so, however, he was careful to verify that the men on the field were indeed Republicans. That man has now been identified as James Hodgkinson, 66. Those in the Democrat-controlled media were quick to note that Hodgkinson was white; male; and brandishing a gun. They were less ready to share with the public Hodgkinson’s politics—and understandably so. Hodgkinson, you see, was an avid supporter of Bernie Sanders who was actually part of the Vermont Senator’s presidential campaign. He was also just as avidly—or rabidly—opposed to the presidency of Donald Trump. Hodgkinson’s Facebook posts tell you all that you need to know about his political orientation. Readers can see for themselves here. For now, a random selection of Hodgkinson’s pearls will suffice to provide a glimpse into the dark recesses of his soul. On June 12, just two days before the now (thankfully) deceased Hodgkinson perpetrated a mass shooting, he wrote: “I Want to Say Mr. President, for being an a**h*** you are Truly the Biggest A** H*** We Have Ever Had in the Oval Office.” “Make America Great Again [Trump], Resign!” “Trump is Guilty & Should Go to Prison for Treason.” “Trump is a Mean, Disgusting Person.” On June 8, of Georgia Republican Karen Handel, Hodgkinson said that she’s a “Republican B**ch” who “Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It’s Right for You!” America has been turned into a “Fascist State,” so everyone should “Vote Blue, It’s Right for You!” Hodgkinson linked to a meme for “Bernie Sanders Day” (which is July 26, for those of you who are interested). It contains tips for the ways in which observers can commemorate the failed Democrat presidential candidate. Just last week, Hodgkinson posted a meme featuring two gay men embracing. The caption reads: “How to solve global warming: Convince Republicans that rising temperatures are turning people gay.” Like Sanders, Hodgkinson was an unabashed proponent of “Democratic socialism.” He posted: “Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: ‘We the People’ Since 1776.” Hodgkinson links to such sites as Yahoo and MSNBC with frequency. A friend of his described him as “a passionate progressive.” Indeed he was that, for Hodgkinson implored Democrat senators to filibuster Neal Gorsuch’s confirmation, impeach Trump, and “tax the rich.” He criticized Reagan-style tax cutting as “trickle-down economics,” believed in anthropogenic “climate change,” and called the GOP “the Taliban of America.” On May 26, Hodgkinson shared a post from “Republicans Suck.” It read: “Republicans Hate Women, Minorities, Working Class People, & Most All (99%) of the People of the Country.” He was especially incensed over the GOP’s substitute for Obamacare. “Higher Costs & Less Coverage,” Hodgkinson wrote. “Who Would Have Thought That the Republican Law Makers Don’t Give a Damn About the Working Class in this Country.” “Vote All Republicans Out of Office is the Start!” he added. Hodgkinson specifically targeted House Majority Whip and one of his shooting victims, Steve Scalise (who is now in critical condition), by sharing a cartoon that linked the latter to “white supremacy.” In other words, Hodgkinson was a left-wing Democrat all of the way. He was a fan of Bill Maher and, especially, Rachel Maddow, going so far as to express his wish that the latter would eventually run for the presidency. A neighbor of Hodgkinson’s, Aaron Meurer, said of him: “I knew he was a Democrat, a pretty hardcore one. I know he wasn’t happy when Trump got elected [.]” By all accounts, Hodgkinson was not “mentally ill” (unless, as Michael Savage long ago said, “liberalism,” Hodgkinson’s leftist ideology, is a mental disorder”). He was methodical, calculating. Nor is this would-be assassination the occasion to discuss “gun control,” as Hodgkinson’s fellow travelers on the left would have us think. Doubtless, Hodgkinson himself was more likely than not to be a champion of “gun control.” While it would be grossly unfair and inaccurate to suggest that your average leftist Democrat would so much as think to follow his example, the stone-cold fact of the matter is that Hodgkinson was nothing more or less than the anti-Trump, anti-GOP hatred of the contemporary “progressive” vision taken to its extreme logical term. Politically speaking, Hodgkinson was indistinguishable from Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and, of course, Bernie Sanders. He was politically indistinguishable from every Democrat congressperson and senator who spares no occasion to demonize the Republicans in order to stall President Trump’s agenda: As they cook up the Russian Conspiracy theory to paint the President as a traitor, so too did Hodgkinson specifically label Trump as such. Hodgkinson was politically indistinguishable from Maddow and virtually every Trump-hating, GOP-hating talking head at CNN, MSNBC, and on the major network news broadcasts. His Facebook screeds could’ve easily appeared as editorials in the New York Times, Washington Post, Daily News, Huffington Post, The Nation, Salon, Slate, and legions of other leftist publications. He was politically indistinguishable from our court jesters, the Colberts, Kimmels, and Mahers. He was politically indistinguishable from Madonna, Kathy Griffin, Snoop Dogg, and every other Hollywood celebrity who labors inexhaustibly to vilify Republicans generally and Trump specifically. Hodgkinson was politically indistinguishable from the vast majority of academics who are filled with precisely the same ugly thoughts that led him to try slaughtering as many Republicans as he could. In short, James Hodgkinson, the “hard core” Democrat whose murderous hatred of Trump and all things Republican drove him to try purging the planet of Republicans is now a late member of…“the Resistance.” This is something for all of us to keep front and center as we move forward.

254,http://hotair.com/archives/2017/06/14/trump-delivers-message-unity-response-shooting/,"President Trump delivered a brief speech emphasizing unity and public service after this morning’s mass shooting oin Alexandria, VA. “Everyone on that field is a public servant, our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated members of Congress who represent our people,” Trump said. He continued, “We may have our differences but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good. “Please take a moment today to cherish those you love and always remember those who serve and keep us safe. God bless them all. God bless you and God bless America.” As Allahpundit noted earlier, Trump opened his statement with the announcement that the gunman had died of his injuries. “As you all know, shortly after 7 a.m. this morning a gunman opened fire on members of Congress and their staffs as they were practicing for tomorrow’s annual charity baseball game,” Trump said. He continued, “Authorities are continuing to investigate the crime and the assailant has now died from his injuries.” Trump then offered an update on Rep. Scalise saying he was in stable condition in the hospital along with the two Capitol Hill police officers and two others. Echoing a point made by other witnesses this morning, Trump praised the actions of the police. “Many lives would have been lost if not for the heroic actions of the two Capitol police officers who took down the gunman despite sustaining gunshot wounds during a very, very brutal assault,” Trump said.

It might seem bad enough that NPR would bury the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and other Republicans to the bottom of the ""Week in Politics"" on Friday's All Things Considered. But that NPR ""news"" program also aired a fraudulent ""Fact Check"" asking the self-evident question ""Is Left-Wing Violence Rising?"" They found a left-wing expert to insult everyone's intelligence by proclaiming: ""The far left is very active in the United States, but it hasn't been particularly violent for some time."" Then anyone conservative who would question left-wing violence is somehow placed on the ""far right"" by NPR, which insists it doesn't have an ideological stance. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Far-right pundits are seizing on this week's shooting at a congressional baseball practice as an example of what they say is a rise in the left-wing violence in the U.S. Experts who monitor domestic terrorism had been warning about the potential for left-wing radicalization as a backlash to President Donald Trump. But as NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, they're hesitant to call it a trend at this point. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Lately here on the West Coast we keep seeing theatrical street confrontations between far right and far left - Berkeley, Portland, and just last night on the campus of The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Move it. Move it. SIEGLER: It takes dozens of police in riot gear to keep these two groups apart. The right-wing group came to protest what they see as campus' overly liberal ideology. Their leader is a guy named Joey Gibson. And just a few minutes in he's nursing a bleeding eyebrow. JOEY GIBSON: You know what you get in these hardcore liberal areas? They threw a can, hit me right in the face. SIEGLER: Gibson is talking about a large group of leftist protesters often called antifas, short for anti-fascists. They wear black and hide their faces....The antifas say they're here to counter what they see as the right's violence and creeping fascism. This masked student gives his name as Felix. He says given the current political situation violence is to be expected. FELIX: You know, people are desperate, and they see the government turning back into the aggressive Reaganomics and racist undertones and rhetoric. So once they start kicking, like, you know, 25 million people off the health care then you're going to start seeing riots.  So there it is: the threat (if not a promise) of more riots against Republican policies. But this is the closest Siegler gets to giving the conservative side some consideration, from an expert on right-wing extremists: SIEGLER: The idea that some on the far left are openly condoning violence is a red flag for extremist group monitors like J.J. MacNab. She says the clashes between antifas and far-right protesters on the West Coast are increasingly volatile. J. J. MACNAB: This is a dangerous game. People are going to die. No one's died yet, but it's just a matter of time. SIEGLER: Antifa's membership appears to be growing beyond its traditional West Coast base while also embracing other leftist ideas beyond just fighting white supremacists. MacNab says white supremacists are widely condemned - and deservedly - for their violent tendencies. But she worries antifa is getting a pass with violence just because they're attacking racists. MACNAB: Attack them with words. Don't come in with sticks with nails in them. Then Siegel calls the National Rifle Association the ""far right,"" which is insulting millions of gun-rights activists: SIEGLER: On the far right, activists are trying to exploit the idea that groups on the far left like antifa are the ones inciting the violence. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. SIEGLER: This online video was produced by the National Rifle Association. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: To smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. NPR's ""unidentified woman"" is Dana Loesch, and the video is a one-minute political ad called ""The Violence of Lies.""  So isn't this supposed to be a ""fact check"" segment? There aren't schools that teach that Trump is Hitler? (Hundreds of journalists do.) Leftist protesters haven't smashed windows, burned cars, shut down interstates and airports? They're not really assessing the facts at NPR. They're trying to argue against the evidence, that leftist violence isn't a growing problem. SIEGLER: The actual data tell a much different story. Mark Pitcavage tracks domestic extremism for the Anti-Defamation League. MARK PITCAVAGE: The far left is very active in the United States, but it hasn't been particularly violent for some time. SIEGLER: According to the league's data, in the past 10 years 2 percent of all murders associated with extremist ideology came from the left. Seventy-four percent came from the extreme right, including the mass shooting at a black church in South Carolina, last month's deadly stabbings on a Portland commuter train. [By a Bernie Sanders supporter!??!] Pitcavage says you have to go back to the 1970s to see a real cycle of deadly violence from the left. PITCAVAGE: But because of the controversial nature of the Trump presidency and some of the things that have occurred over the past six months there legitimately is a chance that we could see more violence from the left. And, you know, that should concern everybody. SIEGLER: Domestic terrorism experts say that concern is only heightened by the fact that in the current polarized country what's considered mainstream and what's considered fringe is getting more blurry. Kirk Siegler, NPR News. Pitcavage is a left-wing expert, a tracker of far-right militia groups, starting first at the Southern Poverty Law Center. But what Siegler is ignoring is the present day. In 2016, this same Anti-Defamation League found 49 out of the 69 extremist murders were domestic Islamic terrorism -- Omar Mateen's shooting of the gay nightclub in Orlando. The ADL doesn't associate that with the far right (and not as the Left). This same Anti-Defamation League is actually warning of an increase in left-wing violence, but somehow, NPR couldn't find that. Here's an article by Vice News (h/t Daily Caller): “I think we’re in a time when we can’t ignore the extremism from the Left,” said Oren Segal, the director of the Center on Extremism, an arm of the Anti-Defamation League. Over the past few months, the ADL, which hosts regular seminars on homegrown extremism for law enforcement officials, has begun warning of the rising threat posed by far-left groups, most recently at a seminar just this past Sunday. “When we have anti-fascist counterprotests — not that they are the same as white supremacists — that can ratchet up the violence at these events, and it means we can see people who are violent on their own be attracted to that,” Segal said. “I hate to say it, but it feels inevitable.” The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

256,https://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2017/06/14/the-shooting-of-republicans-was-the-gunman-influenced-by-the-resistance-n2341122,"It’s still early yet, but, reportedly, shortly before a would-be assassin opened fire on a baseball team comprised of Republican members of Congress, hitting three of them, including House of Representatives Majority Whip, Steve Scalise, he asked Congressman Ron DeSantis whether his prospective victims were Republicans or Democrats. Presumably, when the shooter, who has just been identified as James Hodgkinson, was satisfied that it was Republicans on whom he was about to set his sights, he shot off dozens of rounds from his hunting rifle. If these eye-witness accounts are accurate, then there is no question that this potential massacre was the worst act of political violence that we have witnessed in this country in a long time. Neither is there any question that it is the culmination of a trend of leftist violence that, in a variety of ways and in a variety of contexts, the left has been visiting upon Donald Trump’s supporters and Republicans generally from at least the time that our President announced his plans to run for the office back in June of 2015. There have been literally hundreds of documented attacks against those sporting pro-Trump paraphernalia and attending Trump’s rallies. Leftist billionaires and millionaires have been busy financing mercenaries, paid leftist agitators, to crash Republican politicians’ “town hall” meetings, to “get in the faces” of Republicans, a course of action that Barack Obama once infamously urged his supporters to appropriate when dealing with their political opponents. Shortly prior to the last presidential election, a GOP campaign office in North Carolina was firebombed. Academics, like Cornel West, along with others of his ideological ilk, have created a “Resistance” movement against, not any particular policies of the President and his party, but the very election of Donald Trump. Celebrities like Madonna admit to fantasizing about “blowing up” Trump’s White House. Comedian Kathy Griffin has a photoshoot in which she is featured holding up the decapitated, bloody head of the President. Rapper “Snoop Dogg” makes a video of himself shooting a clown that is obviously meant to resemble Trump, and his nephew “Bow Wow” threatens to “pimp out” the First Lady. The New York Public Theater stages a play that depicts a Trump-centric Julius Caesare being stabbed to death. The left, whether in its standard Democrat or neoconservative/NeverTrump varieties, spares no occasion to delegitimize Trump’s presidency and demonize, no, dehumanize, him as a person.  By implication, leftists, as represented by Hillary Clinton’s immemorial remarks, demonize and dehumanize as well the President’s tens of millions of supporters, those “irredeemables” and “deplorables.” The left has long backed Black Lives Matter (BLM), a movement—begotten by the lie that black thug Michael Brown had his hands up when he was shot and killed by a white Ferguson, Missouri police officer—some of whose members have openly demanded the death of police officers and others of whom have literally tried to bring this wish to fruition. The left has spawned “Antifa” (“antifascists”), thugs dressed in all black and wearing masks.  These punks make it their business to burn American flags, curse police officers, and use any and all available weapons in order to literally beat those who support the President and America. Democrats in Congress, along with their NeverTrump allies across the aisle, show utter contempt for Trump.  Their fellow travelers in the Fake News media—places like CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post, and the New York Times—promote entirely unsubstantiated propaganda, like the Russian “collusion” Conspiracy, designed to vilify Trump and those in his administration as traitors to the country. Given this toxic environment, in some cases, the murderously disdainful environment, that leftists in academia, Hollywood, the media, and Congress have promoted, it is unsurprising that some hate-filled person would decide to get in on the game by gunning down a bunch of Republicans. What is surprising is that shootings of the type that occurred this morning in Alexandria, Virginia haven’t been occurring more frequently. Among the things the left has given America is the return of political violence in 2017.  The mass shooting in Alexandria seems to be a product of this. Of course, thus far, no leftist commentator or “journalist” is speaking to the role that their ideology likely played in this.  What the talking heads in the media have told us, though, is that the shooter was described as a “white middle-aged man.”  Ah. This is telling:  Whenever there’s a case of Islamic terrorism, say, or of black-on-nonblack crime, these same folks who trip over themselves in their rush to identify the whiteness of suspected criminal perpetrators are conspicuously silent on the matter of race. All too predictably, there are already those on the left who are exploiting the gunning down of Republican lawmakers for their political agenda. Twitter is aglow with tweets about Steve Scalise’s refusal to support gun “controls” and his willingness to accept money from the NRA. Here’s one by “Katrina” or “silentkpants”: “Steve Scalise supported bills to loosen gun restrictions, opposed controls, & accepted $7, 450 from NRA.” This tweeter then adds: “My thoughts & prayers are with him.” Though this remark doesn’t deserve to be dignified with a response—it’s irrational and disingenuous on multiple levels—I will briefly address it anyhow: (1)As of this point, we do not yet know whether the shooter legally owned the weapon that he used.  He could have obtained it through the black market or stolen it.  And this brings us to our next point: (2)Even had guns of the sort allegedly used in Virginia been completely banned, this would only create that much larger of a black market.  That is to say, just like the plethora of drugs that are criminalized but which remain very much available to those who desire them, guns of all sorts will remain very much available to those who want them. Restrictions on the Second Amendment guarantee this. (3) Because of (1) and (2), it is offensive, both intellectually and morally, to think that Scalise is somehow reaping what he sowed in opposing “controls” and accepting money from the NRA. Again, details are still murky.  However, that leftists have mainstreamed hatred of their opponents and legitimized political violence can easily explain how Republicans became targeted for death while practicing for an annual Congressional baseball game. Republicans and all decent folks should indeed capitalize upon this outrage as a teachable moment, the moment when the remotely sober-minded, and perhaps even some of the haters, may recognize the dangerousness of the environment that their noxious words have contributed to creating.

Following the shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise and the others present at the Republican baseball practice, there was a notable dearth of the gun-control pushing by the Big Three Networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC). That fact was also picked up by ABC’s Martha Raddatz, who questioned her panel about why that was during This Week on Sunday. “Do you think that had to do with the fact that you had the capitol police officer there-- the security detail who really did stop this from being a much more tragic event,” she asked, triggering a rush to push the policy. According to one panelist, the facts of the shooting backed up the pro-gun stance. The question was initially directed at Democratic Pollster Margie Omero. “We don't need to wait for more tragedies to take action on guns,” she responded enthusiastically. “This is a way we can be healing because voters are ready.” She touted how she had recently taken part in conducting a poll on gun-control to mark the one-year anniversary of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub terror attack. “We found a majority of Americans want fewer guns. They want guns harder to get. And we tested 16 different proposals, majorities of Americans supported 15, even in gun households,” she claimed without providing any details of what was specifically asked or what the proposals were. It’s worth noting that every time the panel or Raddatz mentioned the Orlando attack they only referred to it as a mass shooting and not an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack. “The problem is a majority of Americans don't vote in the GOP primary, so-- And I agree with everything you're saying,” quipped CNN Commentator Marc Lamont Hill. “The problem though is: This is about politics. This has never been about what most Americans want.” And in a veiled reference to the National Rifle Association, Hill said: “We have to find a way to get beyond the kind of power of particular lobbies if we're going to get anywhere.” According to him “that’s part of the danger.”  And in a bizarre statement, Hill described the shooting as a “perfect case study” of the pro-gun philosophy: But if you are on the right this week, this was your perfect case study. The whole argument of: good guy with a gun beats a bad guy with a gun. I disagree with that argument, but this was a case study that’s almost hard for the left to push back. And we wanted too, but it was hard too. But the gun-control pushing didn’t end there. Raddatz spent the last few minutes of the program lecturing the audience about gun violence. She read a Facebook post by Senator Chris Murphy who was “conflicted” about playing in the baseball game on Thursday. “What does it say about us as a country that we can so easily move on from such a seemingly cataclysmic event,” she read. “Are we so jaundiced to gun violence and mass shootings that it only takes us 24 hours now to revert back to business as usual?” The ABC host made it clear that she stood with Murphy, a congressman who once tried to get a national “assault weapons” ban. “Senator Murphy is right. We have become too numb to it all. Massively desensitized to the carnage, as he put it. That, perhaps, includes us as journalists who rush to cover the latest shooting and move to the next headline,” she opined. What Raddatz failed to mention was that much of the gun violence was due to gang violence, not mass shootings. And on top of that, she didn’t mention that the country had been experiencing near historic lows for gun violence, down roughly 49 percent from 1993. And the decline in the homicides was accompanied with soaring gun ownership rates, up roughly 56 percent from 1993. The Pew Research Center had determined that most people don’t realize crime is down, so no matter what her guest claims they polled they may not be aware of those crime statistics.

This Week
		June 18, 2017
		9:35:13 AM Eastern MARTHA RADDATZ: And Margie, one of the things about this shooting is, usually there's a lot of discussion about tougher gun laws. There wasn't this time. Do you think that had to do with the fact that you had the capitol police officer there-- the security detail who really did stop this from being a much more tragic event? MARGIE OMERO: We don't need to wait for more tragedies to take action on guns. This is a way we can be healing because voters are ready. We just did a poll, we did it in May in advance of there’s the one-year anniversary of the Pulse shooting. That also happened this week, other shootings, dozens of shootings every day that don't make national news. We found a majority of Americans want fewer guns. They want guns harder to get. And we tested 16 different proposals, majorities of Americans supported 15, even in gun households. MARC LAMONT HILL: The problem is a majority of Americans don't vote in the GOP primary, so-- And I agree with everything you're saying. The problem though is: This is about politics. This has never been about what most Americans want. Most Americans want universal background checks, still doesn’t matter. We have to find a way to get beyond the kind of power of particular lobbies if we're going to get anywhere. I think that’s part of the danger. But if you are on the right this week, this was you perfect case study. The whole argument of: good guy with a gun beats a bad guy with a gun. I disagree with that argument, but this was a case study that’s almost hard for the left to push back. And we wanted too, but it was hard too. (…)  9:56:22 AM Eastern RADDATZ: As we’ve noted there was a striking show of unity after that shooting at an early morning baseball practice for Republican members of Congress. Lawmakers joining together in a moment of prayer on the baseball field before the annual charity game went on as planned. But one player says he felt conflicted about being there. As a fellow member of congress was lying in the hospital in critical condition. Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has played on the Democratic team for the past decade. On Facebook, he asked: “What does it say about us as a country that we can so easily move on from such a seemingly cataclysmic event. Are we so jaundiced to gun violence and mass shootings that it only takes us 24 hours now to revert back to business as usual? Senator Murphy is right. We have become too numb to it all. Massively desensitized to the carnage, as he put it. That, perhaps, includes us as journalists who rush to cover the latest shooting and move to the next headline. We’ve marked the anniversary of some of those most devastating attacks recently. Last Monday, one year since the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. 49 killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. History. And yesterday marked two years since nine were killed at Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. Those mass shootings are seared in our memory. But in the last week alone, 262 people have lost their lives to gun violence across the U.S. 559 more wounded. Consider that, 262 killed in one week. So today, we think of Congressman Steve Scalise, as well as Matt Mika and Capitol Police Officer Crystal Greiner, who are all still hospitalized after Wednesday’s senseless shooting. But we should also pause this morning, we should pause and remember each and every life cut short by violence in our country. Because as Speaker Paul Ryan put it this week: “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.”  The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

In case you didn’t know – and since you’re probably not an under-informed, virtue-signaling celebrity half-wit, why would you? – June 2 is National Gun Violence Awareness Day. You’re supposed to wear orange to remind people that gun violence exists, and you think that stinks. (It’s also National Donut Day. Why not combine the two and get a donut with orange icing? “Gun violence bad. Sugary carbs good.”) To mark the day – National Gun Violence Awareness Day, not National Donut Day – Daily Beast had a fawning piece about Julianne Moore and her tireless efforts to let people know she disapproves of gun violence. “As the Chair of the Everytown Creative Council, the actress has assembled a veritable who’s who of A-listers and artists to tweet and advocate on behalf of gun safety,” Daily Beast’s Amy Zimmerman wrote. A who’s who of tweeting A-listers? Your days are numbered gun violence! More from Daily Beast: “I was going through my address book alphabetically,” Moore recalled in a 2015 People interview. “That’s all I did. ‘Please, are you interested,’ and the response has been overwhelming. I’m so, so thrilled. Everybody feels this way about this issue.” Wow, all her Hollywood pals felt the same way? “Kim Kardashian, Sarah Silverman, Spike Lee, and Chelsea Handler” all agreeing on politics? Who woulda thunk it? “In the past,” Zimmerman wrote, “Moore has categorized Everytown as “not an anti-gun movement or a partisan movement. This is about safety.” But now that Trump, a self-described “Second Amendment person”—who Moore has criticized and protested against—is President, the work that Everytown does has become more vital, and more controversial, than ever. “I think it’s really important for people to realize that the NRA does not work for gun owners, they work for gun manufacturers,” Moore emphasized. “This is a lobbying group, it’s about money…The NRA was the largest contributor to President Trump’s campaign.” Moore has always been coy about her aims, playing Twitter footsie with unabashed gun-grabber Valerie Jarrett and then calling herself a “believer in the Constitution.” In addition, she refuses to admit the possibility that gunplay and violence in movies and TV might play a role fostering violence. In 2015, MRC Culture analyzed the top 10 movies playing in theaters in the week immediately after the Roseburg, Oregon shooting. We found 334 separate violent acts; 121 acts of gun violence; 39 dead out of 142 total victims. The Hollywood Reporter reached out for Moore’s reaction. Here’s our summary of the relevant Q&A: Moore objects to being lumped in with those calling for more gun control and explained her position to The Hollywood Reporter: Second Amendment advocates say you are calling for more gun control. Are they correct? I am an American citizen and a believer in the Constitution. But I believe that with the rights that the Constitution gives us, we also have responsibilities. I am committed to improving gun safety in the U.S. and reducing gun violence by advocating for background checks, gun licenses and safe gun storage, and by keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Sounds reasonable, if ineffective at addressing mass shootings. But Moore was corresponding with Valerie Jarrett. Jarrett’s boss just responded to the Roseburg incident by proudly politicizing the tragedy and saying, “We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours – Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.” Those “countries like ours” essentially banned hand guns. That sure sounds like gun control. Is there any daylight between Obama’s opinion and Jarrett’s? If so, please explain, Ms. Moore. Back to THR: Are these Second Amendment advocates against what you call ""gun safety?"" I actually think that a belief in the Second Amendment and a belief in gun safety are not mutually exclusive. No, they’re not. Just ask the organization that does more than anyone else to promote and ensure gun safety, the NRA. But we digress. Do critics who accuse Hollywood of glorifying gunplay have a valid point? It is impossible to be killed by watching a violent movie, but unfortunately, it is all too possible to be shot and killed while sitting in a theater and watching any kind of movie. So no. Predictably, Moore and her colleagues will not admit the possibility of their products having a negative impact on society. Meanwhile, Hollywood loves to remind us how it changed attitudes about the things it likes, like gay rights. Sadly, some people do get to have it both ways.

At least seven people were injured in the melee. Bubba Hinson allegedly filmed the incident from his balcony, and in the video, you can hear over a dozen shots fired. “I thought they were dancing. That’s why I started filming it,” Hinson told The Myrtle Beach Sun News. “Then, they started fighting. Then, they started shooting.” Myrtle Beach Mayor John Rhodes released a statement on Sunday expressing his displeasure that the video had been live streamed, noting that ""it does not look good for the city of Myrtle Beach."" “Social media today puts this word out quickly,"" he said. ""We’re gonna send a message to do everything that’s humanly possible to stop this violence in our city,"" Rhodes added. ""I’m sorry for our city that this happened."" Myrtle Beach Police Department Lt. Joey Crosby noted on Sunday that a suspect in the shooting had been taken into custody. ""A suspect in this case has been identified and apprehended,” Crosby said. He said that the name of the suspect “will be released once he has been medically cleared and the warrants can be served.” The video has since been pulled down from Facebook, but you can see the footage in the YouTube video below.

262,http://hotair.com/archives/2017/06/11/no-good-samaritans-china/,"In more than 12 years of writing about news events online, I’ve seen a lot of disturbing videos. Scenes of chaos and violence are not hard to find in the war on terror era or whatever we’re now calling the global conflict with radical Islam. If you’ve seen some of the theatrical murders staged and filmed by ISIS, you know what I’m talking about. But the most disturbing video I’ve ever seen wasn’t the result of a terror attack or an air strike or a mass shooting. It didn’t involve bombs or bullets. It was a 2011 video from China showing a 2-year-old being run over by a truck. And as the helpless child died in the street, no one came to help. Recently, a similar video went viral in China, racking up 5 million views before it was censored by the government. It shows a woman being hit by a taxi. She goes flying and winds up lying in the street. There are dozens of pedestrians who see the accident from just a few dozen feet away. Some of them look at her as they cross the street near her unmoving body, but none of them stop or try to help her. At one point, the woman’s head comes up off the pavement. She is still alive. And still, no one helps her. Eventually, she is run over by another car, a large SUV that stops a few feet past her body. The driver opens her door and appears to talk to another woman who finally walks toward the body in the street. The woman in the video died and the two drivers who ran her over are reportedly being investigated. But, like the previous video, what is shocking here is not the initial accident.  Those happen everywhere. It’s the casual indifference that follows. There are lots of people right there who could stop to help but none of them do. The Associated Press reports that it has led many in China to wonder what, exactly, is wrong with their society: Here, the common refrain goes, is an unmoored country where manufacturers knowingly sell toxic baby formula and fraudulent children’s vaccines. Restaurants cook with recycled “gutter oil” and grocery stores peddle fake eggs, fake fruit, even fake rice. Many Chinese say they avoid helping people on the street because of widespread stories about extortionists who seek help from passers-by and then feign injuries and demand compensation — perhaps explaining the Zhumadian incident… “In the West, law, faith and morality are a three-legged stool,” said Ma Ai, a sociologist at the China University of Political Science and Law. “Our legal system is catching up, but we don’t have religion and a new moral system has not established after China transformed away from a traditional, collectivist society.”… In 2009, the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, ran a provocative story with a picture of a dog standing by another injured dog in a busy street and pondered whether humans would do the same. The report was headlined, “Do Chinese people lack compassion?” A 2014 state media poll found that Chinese thought “lacking faith and ethics” was the No. 1 social problem, followed by “being a bystander or being selfish.” I’ve heard plenty of sermons on the Good Samaritan over the years. It’s a parable in which the familiar, respectable religious people leave a man to die on the side of the road while a man from a culture that was widely despised at the time stops and helps the stranger. One of the lessons of the parable is that goodness transcends borders and cultures. But maybe that’s not always the case. There don’t seem to be many good Samaritans on the streets in China, only people who see a woman dying and keep walking. How do you begin to fix something like that?

263,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/reaganmccarthy/2017/06/13/untitled-n2340691,"Yesterday marked the one year anniversary of the tragic Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando that killed 49 law-abiding citizens. It was also the anniversary of a Planned Parenthood sub-group, PP Black Community, placing blame on ‘toxic masculinity’ and homophobia for the tragedy rather than radical Islamic terrorism. As Kat Timpf wrote in the National Review last year, the shooting was, of course, not motivated purely by Islam as a whole. But, any reasonable person can differentiate between Islam as a religion and radical Islam, which is the most common motivation behind terrorism. Omar Mateen, the culprit of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, pledged allegiance to ISIS.  Not to ‘toxic masculinity.’ It is insulting to the victims of the terror attack for a group like Planned Parenthood, who claims to champion equal rights for women and the LGBTQ communities, to refuse to call the shooting what it was: an act of radical Islamic terrorism and an attack on western values. Of course, most will not refute that Mateen was likely a homophobe who hated Americans. However, that’s just it: radical Islam hates America and our values. What opponents of labeling domestic attacks as radical Islamic terror, even when the man behind the deadly shooting clearly had distinct ties to ISIS, won’t admit is that the aforementioned traits are consistent with radical Islam. Those who subscribe to radical Islamic terrorism hate America, our values and everything we stand for, so of course those same people would likely be homophobic. The problem is that the Left, who are often apologists for terrorists,  would rather downplay a terror attack than label it as radical Islam. Unfortunately, a year after the horrific Orlando shooting, the trend of discounting terroristic acts did not end. Following the May Manchester terror attack, Democrats still refused to condemn radical Islam and label the attack as such. Particularly, Massachusetts congressional candidate Brianna Wu blamed misogyny for the attack on Manchester.

264,https://www.nationalreview.com/article/448573/orlando-massacre-propaganda-rewriting-history,"Follow Us National Review ‘The Original Feminist Plan for Women’s Equality’ Trash Talk, Better Talk Casanova and His Female Counterparts, in Benoît Jacquot’s Latest Hey, Joe: Americans ‘Flag’ Disinformation from the President, Not the Other Way Around Good Ole’ American Optimism Is Back One year ago yesterday, Omar Mateen went into a gay nightclub in Orlando and murdered 49 people. While on the phone with a 911 operator, Mateen made his motive clear: “Yo, the air strike that killed Abu [Waheeb] a few weeks ago – that’s what triggered it. They should have not bombed and killed Abu [Waheeb].” There we have it. A radicalized jihadist self-identified as “Mujahideen” and an “Islamic soldier,” American born and raised, committed the deadliest mass shooting in American history, directly targeting the LGBTQ+ community in the name of a murdered Islamic State militant. Yet the media, unhappy with this narrative, have constructed another one: “Why did this happen?” The FBI destroyed the internalized-homophobia narrative constructed by unsubstantiated media reports in the weeks following the massacre, with law enforcement stating that the FBI had found zero credible evidence that Mateen, who had been married twice, secretly indulged in homosexual behavior or interests. With only an “Islamophobic” narrative remaining after those pesky facts, the media have decided to pay tribute to the barbaric murder of 49 infidels with a “senseless violence” narrative. “Pulse gunman’s motive: Plenty of theories, but few answers,” read an Orlando Sentinel headline. The Washington Post referred to the night 49 people “died” as having been “upended by gun violence.” The New York Times equated the terrorist attack with “a year of racism,” with the insinuation that Donald Trump spearheaded the latter. It didn’t matter that Mateen intentionally targeted the Pulse Nightclub as an attack on liberal values; his true crime was gun violence. An uptick of fear of Wahhabism and non-Westernized Islam is not a product of observation and inference; it’s irrational, a blanket Islamophobia. The truth is just an inconvenient narrative. The 911 transcript, released with most of its mentions of ISIS redacted in a Friday-evening news dump, depicts a single-minded terrorist hell-bent on avenging the assassination of an obscure ISIS militant. As noted by the New York Times’ ISIS and al-Qaeda correspondent, Rukmini Callimachi: “Waheeb is killed in an airstrike on May 6. Meaning Waheeb is killed around 1 month before Mateen’s killing spree. For an entire month, Mateen kept this guy’s name in his brain. ISIS-inspired attackers usually go for the Great Hits. They name Awlaki, Adnani, Jihadi John, Baghdadi. But Abu Waheeb? Seriously? At minimum transcript shows Mateen was deep in the fanboy-ism.” Apparently, many find this evidence to be lacking, just a “theory” rather than a politically satisfying “answer.” The Orlando Sentinel opined in a news piece last week that, because Mateen did not explicate to his wife (who is charged with aiding and abetting terrorism) that he wanted to shoot up a gay club, then this must fall into the senseless-violence narrative. This line of thought creates a bigotry of low expectations for American Muslims. Many of them practice their faith in a manner fully compatible with secular liberalism, but extremist thugs like Mateen — who view women and homosexuals as second-class citizens and believe that violence is always the answer — are fallaciously equated with Westernized Muslims, on the theory that it couldn’t have been Wahhabist jihad that caused Mateen to commit a hate crime. To believe that would be “Islamophobic.”  Hashtags and rainbow-filtered declarations of “Love Wins,” “Hate will not divide us,” “Orlando United Day,” and “Honor Them with Action” have flooded Twitter in remembrance of the victims of June 12, 2016. We must recognize those murdered in the attack, but “love” will win only if we recognize and vanquish the extremist enemy. We remain incapable of honoring the victims so long as the media continue to propagate this myth that the Pulse terrorist attack and hate crime was not a part of a global movement to forcibly and violently impose the will of a literalist, extremist interpretation of Islam onto the rest of the world. No, hate will not divide us, if we stay smart and proactive. But willful ignorance? That will destroy us. READ MORE: One Year After the Orlando Massacre, Why Does the ISIS Caliphate Still Exist?

265,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/tlWEmyTXlyo/,"CNN contributor Dean Obeidallah told CNN during Sunday evening’s live coverage of the apparent terror attack outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in London that Breitbart News was to blame for inciting the attack. Obeidallah, a former attorney and part-time comedian, was asked about what the media can to do “de-escalate the animosity” in society. He answered: You see it on Fox News, you see on the Breitbarts out there, really demonizing Muslims, portraying us as threats to America. You have people in the White House now like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. You had Michael Flynn — who is no longer part of the administration, who was on the board of directors for ACT for America, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the biggest anti-Muslim group in America. You have Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, got an award last year from ACT for America. So you have a direct line from the White House to anti-Muslim bigotry. I really hope as a nation we can take a step back and stop over-sensationalizing hate. We saw a horrific attack this week on a member of Congress. Other members of Congress could have been hurt. It’s part and parcel of the same thing. It’s demonizing, ginning up fear, irrationally ginning up fear, and people responding in the worst way possible. So, I’m concerned. Last year, Obeidallah falsely blamed a “far-right activist” for a hit-and-run attack against a Muslim woman in Belgium. When confronted about his error, he tweeted: “go f*ck urself.” On Sunday evening, he took to Twitter to defend his commentary on CNN against someone who complained: look a trump supporter wants me off tv because I dared give facts that linked TRump and his admin with anti-muslim bigotry https://t.co/CZAP8Eu5Xp — (((DeanObeidallah))) (@Deanofcomedy) June 19, 2017 While suggesting that Breitbart News and the White Houseare responsible for anti-Muslim violence, Obeidallah has pushed back recently on the idea that liberal media inspired the mass shooting at a Republican baseball practice last week. In an essay on CNN, he argued that Trump supporters were hypocrites for criticizing a production of Julius Caesar in New York City’s Central Park that featured a President Trump lookalike being assassinated, because past productions elsewhere featured Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton lookalikes in the title role.

The Washington Post marked the one-year anniversary of the horrific Orlando nightclub mass shooting on Monday, but something was repeatedly missing in the coverage: the name of the shooter Omar Mateen, and his ideological inspiration, the Islamic State. On Monday’s front page, they promoted Sunday’s “Equality March” by the gay Left: “It was at times celebratory and at others somber as participants gathered to commemorate the anniversary Monday of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history at an Orlando gay nightclub a year ago. Those touched by the shooting have worked to heal, raising money for the victims and organizing politically.” On the back page of the A-section, they published an entire page of four color photos under the theme “A Year Later, Healing From a Massacre.” There was only a paragraph of text on “the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history,” but no Mateen or ISIS. (One photo promoted Rev. Terri Steed of the Joy Metropolitan Community Church, who preached the LGBT “gospel” that “Jesus went to those on the margins. Jesus went. He said he came to preach to the poor, to reach the outcasts, to set the oppressed free.”)
	 
	On the back of the Metro section was a story all across the bottom half with three color photos under the headline “At Equality March, remembering ‘all 49 angels’ of Pulse: Thousands take part in LGBT demonstration before 1st anniversary of Orlando massacre.” Reporter T. Rees Shapiro used the same template as the front-page blurb,with no Islamic State mentions. The same weird practice was apparent on the front of Saturday’s Style section. The big headline was ""A Poignant Point of Pride: For this year's LGBTQ community celebration, the Human Rights Campaign wears 49 ribbons, one for each life lost at the Pulse nightclub."" Caitlin Gibson wrote ""Monday will mark the first anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in American history -- a horror that unfolded in a popular Florida gay bar that had been a cherished place of safety and acceptance for a marginalized community."" Since Gibson and the Post were acting as publicity agents for the Human Rights Campaign lobby, they skipped over Mateen and warned the anniversary came ""amid a political climate that seems particularly fraught for the LGBTQ community -- President Trump was notably silent when Pride month began on June 1, breaking with President Barack Obama's tradition of issuing a formal proclamation."" Trump is more notorious? A Monday “Morning Mix’ item online by Katie Mettler at least allowed the name “Omar Mateen” in it, but only once, to note when during the night that deadly attack began. Other papers at least mentioned the Islamic State. In a front page USA Today story it came right in paragraph 3: “Miguel Honorato was one of 49 people shot to death June 12, 2016, when a gunman inspired by the Islamic State stormed into Pulse, a gay nightclub.” Deep in the USA Today story, they reported Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer “worked to quickly tamp down anti-Muslim sentiment, to ‘dispel any anger that might be directed toward the Muslim community. We immediately started talking about it as the act of a single person and not reflective of a religion or an ethnicity.’” The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

A look back one year after the shooting took place Family, friends and survivors gathered outside Pulse nightclub in Orlando on Monday, marking one year after 49 people were killed in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Around 2 a.m., a vigil was held for survivors, local officials and club employees — the same time when gunman Omar Mateen opened fire in the crowded gay club on June 12, 2016. It was the first of three services taking place in the Orlando area. Two other services — one midday and a late-night one at the nightclub — will take place along with a gathering in downtown Orlando. All U.S. flags in the state will also be flown half-staff, Gov. Rick Scott announced. A giant rainbow flag will be unveiled at the Orange County government building. THE FALLEN: VICTIMS OF THE ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB MASSACRE The city of Orlando dubbed the day as ""Orlando United Day,"" encouraging people to act with ""love and kindness"" during a day marked by a tragic event. The city tweeted out a photo in the morning that named all 49 victims with the caption, ""We will always #RememberThe49. #OrlandoUnitedDay."" Orlando Police Chief John Mina, in a video, called the night of the massacre ""one of the darkest days in [his] 26 years at the Orlando Police Department."" ""We will always bear the scars of the Pulse tragedy and grieve for those whose lives were cut short,"" Mina said. ""While painful, those scars are reminders that hate and darkness could not defeat us."" A fundraising ""Rainbow Run"" took place over the weekend and a businessman donated thousands of dollars to eight gay and lesbian students for their college studies. POLICE RELEASE FOOTAGE OF ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB ATTACK Nightclub owner Barbara Poma also announced in April plans to turn the site into a memorial for the victims. She initially declined an offer from the city of orlando to buy the club for $2.25 million to turn it into a memorial. Now people can look through an exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre at the Orange County History Center. Mateen walked into the nightclub during ""Latin Night"" and opened fire, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack. He killed 49 people and injured dozens of others before he was killed in a shootout with police after a three-hour standoff. Nearly a year after the massacre, police released body camera footage from that night. Mateen's wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court. She has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband.

269,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jun/19/alex-jones-doesnt-give-megyn-kelly-a-direct-answer-on-sandy-hook-massacre,"Conspiracy theorist hems and haws when pressed repeatedly to admit he was wrong to call Newtown shooting a hoax Last modified on Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.43 GMT The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones hemmed and hawed when pressed repeatedly by Megyn Kelly to admit he was wrong to call the massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, a hoax. Jones did not give a direct answer in a segment on NBC’s Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. Kelly has been criticized for giving a platform to Jones, who has also called the 9/11 attacks an inside job and promoted the false story that a pizza restaurant in Washington DC was the site of a child sex ring.  She has defended her decision by noting that Jones’s influence has grown with the rise of President Donald Trump, who has praised him and appeared on his radio program. “Here’s the thing, Alex Jones isn’t going away,” she said on Sunday night. The Infowars host said at one point he was playing “devil’s advocate” in denying the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook elementary school. But he added that he remained skeptical after he “watched the footage” of children leaving the building. “Some of it looks like it’s real but then what do you do when they’ve got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up,” he said. “I’ve watched the footage. That looks like a drill.” The segment with Jones combined Kelly’s interview with background providing his history of false remarks, his relationship with Trump and comments from a Newtown parent Neil Heslin, whose six-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in the shooting. When Kelly asked Heslin whether he had anything to say to Jones for Father’s Day, he responded: “I think he’s blessed to have his children to spend the day with, to speak to. I don’t have that.” Last week Jones leaked an audio recording of what he said was a phone conversation with Kelly, heard promising she would not portray him as “some kind of bogeyman”. Shortly before Sunday’s night interview, Jones released a Father’s Day video in which he offered condolences to families who had lost children in the “horrible tragedy” of Newtown but did not refer to his previous comments disputing the killings. “Parents should never have to bury their own children,” Jones said. Connecticut’s NBC affiliate said on Friday it wouldn’t air the report. In an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press, NBC Connecticut staff members were told station executives had made the decision after listening to concerns from employees, Sandy Hook families and viewers, and considering “the deep emotions from the wounds of that day that have yet to heal”. Lawyers who represent 12 people who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook urged NBC News officials not to air the interview. The NBC News chairman, Andy Lack, said the Jones story would be edited with its critics in mind. The interview was seen as a test of the interviewing skills of Kelly, the former Fox News star whose questions two weeks ago for Vladimir Putin were widely panned for being too easy on the Russian leader. An unaired segment obtained by the Huffington Post showed Kelly telling him that “virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia”. Kelly challenged Jones from the start, introducing him as a “radical conspiracy theorist” and promising to confront him for his “notorious lie” about Sandy Hook. The two frequently interrupted each other as Kelly kept asking if he would admit to his wrongdoing and a visibly tense Jones kept deflecting her questions, blaming the media for distorting his remarks or veering between acknowledging and disputing the tragedy. “I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil’s advocate,” he said. Answered Kelly: “Of course, there is no evidence on the other side.” Jones also downplayed his connection to Trump, who has spoken warmly of him and at times seemed to use conspiracies aired on Infowars in his campaign speeches. “I think my influence on Trump is way, way lower than what MSM [mainstream media] has said,” he said, adding that he and the president were “friendly” but not friends. After spending more than a decade at Fox, Kelly signed a multimillion-dollar contract with NBC this year. Her star power grew after she challenged Trump during a 2015 Republican debate on his history of sexist remarks and the candidate responded with a series of angry tweets and other comments, sometimes crude and personal, and boycotted a later debate because she was one of the moderators. She was a key figure in the downfall of the former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, telling in-house investigators of inappropriate conduct by Ailes that supported Gretchen Carlson and other women who had made similar accusations. Kelly wrote of her battles with Trump and Ailes in her bestselling 2016 memoir, Settle for More. Kelly’s old employer needled her at the weekend, sending a tweet headlined “Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones: NBC News under fire for ‘botched’ rollout.”",2017-06-19 02:31:37,Alex Jones doesn't give Megyn Kelly a direct answer on Sandy Hook massacre,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
270,http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/police-release-orlando-nightclub-shooting-bodycam-video,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Newly released video from bodycams on officers responding to a mass shooting at a Florida gay nightclub shows shattered glass inside the club, the sounds of automatic gunfire and an officer shouting to the gunman, “Come out with your hands up or you will die!” The videos were released Wednesday to ABC News (http://abcn.ws/2qBUFRA), the Orlando Sentinel (http://bit.ly/2rlx6hf) and the newspaper’s news partner, Fox 35. The 11 hours of video show Pulse patrons running from the club and officers shouting, “Just go!” as they direct them across the street. In another video, an officer off camera inside the club checks for the pulse of a patron only to announce the victim is dead. Later, an officer realizes that the massacre is an act of terrorism. “It’s terrorism in Orlando,” the Orlando Police officer said of the gunman. “He pledged something to the Islamic State.” Forty-nine patrons were killed during last June’s massacre and dozens more were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Gunman Omar Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers after a three-hour standoff. He had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group during phone calls with police negotiators. Some bodycam footage shows Pulse patrons being checked for weapons by officers after escaping the club with their hands up. Other footage shows an officer leading a patron out of a bathroom and down a hallway. “Follow the sound of my voice. Come this way,” the officer said. One club patron was found crouched hiding in a shed and was hesitant to come out of it. “We’re police, man. Come on. Get out!” an officer said. Watch below:   Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

271,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/Wh_ajz7PYjE/the-pulse-massacre-and-the-meaning-of-lgbt-pride,"SEARCH Monday marks the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub massacre. It is also Pride Month, with LGBT communities feeling their rights are more imperiled than ever before. Senior Editor and Writer The deadliest mass shooting in American history, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016, happened in an LGBT venue, and it was aimed at LGBT people. Yes, it was a national tragedy. Yes, it affected people who were not LGBT. But whatever specifically motivated the ISIS-inspired Omar Mateen to kill 49 people a year ago and injure 58 more, he went to Pulse, an LGBT club in Orlando, to do it—and LGBT people were the prime focus of his murderousness. The repeated emphasis is deliberate, because at the time—and still today—reporters and commentators have struggled to articulate and contextualize the tragedy as one aimed at LGBT people. It happened in report after report, and at press conferences after the event, which motivated me that Sunday morning to write a broadside against what quickly became an insulting, fact-omitting, and extremely painful erasure. If LGBT people queried this “tragedy for all” umbrella coverage, or insisted that the media contextualize the tragedy in a more nuanced, sensitive fashion, they—like journalist Owen Jones in Britain—were told that they were being the narrow-minded ones. But the problem wasn’t LGBT people’s—it was a mainstream culture that has always had difficulty reporting, evoking, and covering the full spectrum of LGBT experience. As time has gone on, the media has improved that reporting, and it will be instructive to see how nuanced, sensitive and aware it will be today, Monday, itself. A year on, and the first anniversary of the Pulse massacre falls the day after the Equality Marches, themselves motivated by a different kind of grief and anger. June is Pride month, and the prevailing mood of these months is heavily governed by the victories and losses wrought in the ongoing struggle for LGBT equality. Pride month is a marker month: a time to examine and take stock. The anniversary of the Pulse massacre, which will be marked in Orlando and in cities across the country today, Monday, is a sharp and corrective one. If you have time, read and watch the testimonies of those who lost loved ones, and who are still confronting grievous injuries today. That is what happened that night; these are the real people facing it. The traditionally marginalized—LGBTs, people of color—are here the mainstay of the story. What happened at Pulse, and its residue, reminded LGBT people of the violence and worse they face just because of their sexuality. Omar Mateen is one individual, for sure, but his targeted hatred that night is a hatred known and experienced by many. Hearing the news late at night or waking up that Sunday morning, any LGBT person, as well as feeling a deep sense of horror and upset, may have also recalled moments when they had faced homophobia and violence because of what an aggressor had derangedly deduced about them as people based on them being LGBT, or perceived to be LGBT. The people at Pulse that night—many Latino and black—were killed and injured when they, like so many of us, were in a space they thought was safe, and more than that a place of pleasure, friendship, fun, escape. Suddenly, in New York City, a visit to the Stonewall Bar in Greenwich Village came with an armed guard outside. And so it was that “Pulse”—and it only needed a one-word descriptor—fit into the zig-zagging, forward, backward, stalled, forward again progress of LGBT equality. It wasn’t so long ago that a book proclaimed in its title, Victory, in this fight for equality—but that turned out to be premature. The general arrow may point in one direction, but that arrow has all manner of breaks and anomalies in it, and progress now must be fought for harder than ever. Those old enough to have marched on Pride marches in the 1980s and 1990s (indeed before those decades) will recall a time when protesters would hurl abuse at marchers from the sidelines, police warily watched the progress of the marches, and the general public would stand, bemused, watching all the signs and marchers passing by. At that time, with so many laws and social and cultural mechanisms against us, the motivating force to march was anger and resistance; the same mood that underpinned the original Stonewall Riots. HIV and AIDS, and the terrible tragedies accruing from that pandemic, gave the marches another animating focus. Sure, there was a feeling of celebration and an immense feeling of togetherness and belonging, but Pride—not just the march, but the concept—was political, necessary, vital. Harvey Milk said the most powerful person thing an LGBT person could do was come out; Pride marches were the most literal, visible, and vocal manifestation of the strength of doing just that. As the years went by, there was progress: And it is important to note that the brilliance of the LGBT rights movement combined the bravura actions of direct action protesters like Act Up, with the setting up of organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD and later Freedom To Marry, who lobbied in offices, boardrooms and courtrooms, as well as on the streets; LGBT campaigning was furnished with wildly differing tactics, and sometimes in conflict with another, but ultimately complementary. In the last six years, karma or good planning has meant that some momentous LGBT advances have happened on the eve of Pride themselves, including most dramatically in 2015, the Supreme Court ruling enshrining marriage equality. That night, the Obama White House was lit in rainbow colors. In some politically golden years, Pride has felt like a celebration. The contrast with the current presidential administration couldn't be more stark. With the many attacks on LGBT equality, particularly on trans people, has come a new spirit of resistance—and this was evident in the Equality Marches of Sunday, and perhaps in the Pride marches happening around the country. If that spirit of anger and determination to confront and “resist” feels collective, Pride itself is also becoming a more complex concept. The fractiousness of identity politics radically altered Toronto Pride last year, and possibly this year too, as Black Lives Matter demanded that that city’s police not be allowed to march in the parade. In D.C. this weekend, the day before the Equality March, the city’s Pride march had to be diverted when a group of protesters, No Justice No Pride, called on Capital Pride, the main march’s organizers, to “bar corporate entities that inflict harm on historically marginalized LGBTQ2S people from participation in Pride events.” (2S means “two-spirited.”) The Huffington Post reported that the group also posted a petition on its site pushing Capital Pride to “break ties” with “police, prisons and pipelines.” Reuters reported the protesters particularly objected to the participation of Wells Fargo & Co. and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp. Capital Pride responded, “We encourage a robust, civil, and healthy conversation within the community about all of the issues that impact us and look forward to having a mutually respectful conversation in the days, weeks, and months ahead.” In Toronto, any police marching in the Pride festivities this year will not be allowed to wear their uniforms. New York City Pride has invited those officers to march in the city. A few days ago, Toronto Police raised the rainbow flag at their HQ for the first time. The question facing Prides is: Can the police and these companies be made answerable for whatever it is that protesters are vexed by, as well as maintaining a marching or parade presence within Pride; and do a majority mass of those attending Pride feel the same as the protesters targeting their participation? The commercialization of Pride is something that has rankled many LGBT people for years; just as the name of Pride shifting from a “march” to a “parade” rankled many. Yet somehow, just by their very nature, Pride marches, or parades (you choose) have accommodated all viewpoints—at least until now. When companies first started sponsoring Pride, there wasn’t much in it for them, rather than making a political stand themselves. There was a bravery there. And sure, soon that bravery didn't seem so brave when “gay” became a cool marketing bracket to plunder. But the logos of companies was a badge of progress in itself, and something to celebrate. These same LGBT-supporting corporations and companies have been key in the fight against states’ discriminatory “religious liberty” laws, merging commercial and moral arguments in their alignment with activists. With a greater focus on what these companies do away from LGBT issues, Prides today look set to become an arena for a new set of moral and cultural arguments to be played out on. Many LGBT people, who do not see themselves as particularly conservative, find it moving and significant to see police and military personnel marching in the Pride march, for example: the fact that they do shows bravery on those individuals’ part and progress made in those institutions when it comes to LGBT employment. If “diversity” and “inclusion” are key to Pride marches, then what invalidates the presence of a company deemed by some activists to be morally flawed? A spirit of diversity and inclusion also underpinned the moving memorial events following “Pulse,” which became a moment of coming together across many sexual and social divides in grief, remembrance, anger, and action. Contextualizing it an LGBT tragedy gave “Pulse” an important and educative depth, but it didn’t isolate it. As we remember Pulse’s victims, and prepare for more Prides this June, activists might also confront the value of demanding exclusions from marching at Prides, particularly at a time when LGBT people attending these events do so with a unifying desire to march, and be seen and heard. This isn’t the first time such arguments have played out, and the durability of Pride speaks for itself. These events have been held, in one form or another, since 1970, the year after the Stonewall uprisings. They are likely strong enough to shift meanings and emphasis whatever the political climate is in any given year. Ultimately, a Pride event’s mood and focus is determined on the day—hopefully sunny and not too bakingly hot—by the broad mass of LGBT people participating in it. As anyone who has been to a Pride march knows, it can be angry for 200 yards, and then people start singing, kissing, hugging, whistling, hollering, and waving again. It can be, very humanly, all kinds of a march, all kinds of a mood, all kinds of a day, with all kinds of people involved in it. The most moving Pulse-related testimonies also remind us of their breadth of the LGBT community and its allies. You will find on YouTube news reports of people trying to stand again, and regain use of their limbs. These survivors, as well as those bereaved, are surrounded by “family” of all kinds: LGBT, straight, biological, same-sex partnered, embracing communities. In celebrating their bravery and fortitude, and the love and dedication that exists around them, there may also be timely value in remembering what “Pride” really means.",2017-06-12 00:00:00,"The Pulse Massacre, and the Meaning of LGBT Pride",,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

The first advertiser pulled the plug on the new show. Kristin Lemkau, Chief Marketing Officer of JP Morgan Chase took to Twitter to personally scold Megyn Kelly. As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes. Why? https://t.co/luwyCwP7Ti  They wasted no time pulling their ads from the NBC show: JP Morgan Chase & Co. has asked for its local TV ads and digital ads to be removed from Ms. Kelly’s show and from all NBC news programming until after the show airs, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company doesn’t want any of its ads to appear adjacent to any promotions for the interview, the person added. Parents of Sandy Hook murder victims used Twitter to publicly denounce her giving one single minute of air time to the man who called their deaths a hoax: Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace MÃÂ¡rquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it. @nbc #SandyHook pic.twitter.com/mKrU63KWmA  This piece of actual garbage encourages people to call my mom's death a hoax and harass other Sandy Hook families. Shame on you @megynkelly. https://t.co/uGmhqQAEeR  Megyn Kelly was scheduled to host a benefit gala for the Sandy Hook Promise on June 14. The organization has pulled the plug on her hosting duties: Sandy Hook Promise, a leading gun violence prevention organization, and NBC host Megyn Kelly have agreed that Kelly will no longer host the organization's annual Promise Champions Gala on Wednesday, June 14th, in Washington DC. This decision was spurred by NBC's planned broadcast of Kelly's interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax. ""Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,"" said Nicole Hockley, co-Founder and Managing Director. ""It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview."" In promo clips on the interview, Jones did not even bother to retreat from his vile conspiracy that the mass shooting was a hoax: “Sandy Hook,” she says. “Well Sandy Hook’s complex because I have had debates where, we devil’s advocates have said the whole story is true, and then I have had debates where I have said, that none of it is true.” Ms. Kelly then asked him: “When you say parents faked their children’s death, people get very angry.” “Well I know, but they don’t get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from the sanctions, or they don’t get angry about … ” Mr. Jones said, before he is interrupted by Ms. Kelly, who says, “That’s a dodge.” “No it’s not a dodge,” he continued. He said he “looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it. We didn’t get any of the real important stuff.” Vile. Let’s hope NBC reconsiders giving this man a national platform for his hateful conspiracies and rhetoric.

273,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/18/1672899/-Creator-of-Planned-Parenthood-," By Ema O'Connor Late last month, David Daleiden and his team of criminal attorneys allegedly flouted multiple injunctions and court-issued seals by posting more shocking videos of abortion providers and identifying 14 of the John/Jane Does participating in the state criminal complaint against him and his recording partner Sandra Merritt. Those names were previously under a court seal. This apparent defiance of court orders may end up landing Daleiden and his criminal attorneys in contempt of both state and federal court, potentially resulting in fines and jail time — and disbarment for the lawyers. Daleiden’s work once caused multiple congressional investigations and nearly shut down the government. Two years and multiple lawsuits and legal hurdles later, the 28-year-old and his Planned Parenthood investigation have faded out of the headlines. But as the cases against Daleiden continue — and grow more complicated — he has become a central figure of the somewhat sidelined culture wars, now playing out in both federal and state court in California. On the one hand, his opponents contend that Daleiden is an extreme activist who edited illegally obtained footage in order to harm the biggest abortion provider in the country and, by proxy, its employees. On the other, is a fierce collection of devoted, anti-abortion followers who see the prosecution of Daleiden as an attack on the First Amendment and the oppression of a “hero” by liberal courts and elected officials.   All along, Daleiden has continued fighting his case in court, perhaps no more vigorously than when he and his criminal attorneys released the new tapes and list of names. David Daleiden and his defense attorneys are religious fanatics who don’t see themselves as bound by court orders, or hindered by any accountability for the serious consequences resulting from their deceptive messages. The most serious consequence was the  Colorado Springs mass shooting where a heavily  armed  Robert Dear Jr. attacked a Planned Parenthood Clinic killing three and injuring five police officers and four civilians.

274,https://www.salon.com/2017/06/15/dont-miss-the-point-on-alexandria-and-san-francisco-there-is-a-solution-for-mass-shootings,"On Wednesday we had two mass shootings, one on each coast. A gunman opened fire with an automatic rifle on a group of Republican lawmakers who were practicing for a baseball game in Alexandria, Virginia, injuring six people. The shooter was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Later the same day in San Francisco, an angry employee went into a UPS facility and opened fire, killing three co-workers and himself. I had wondered about the lack of high-profile mass shooting events recently and had thought that maybe the recent spate of killing had peaked at this time last year with the horrifying Orlando terrorist attack and the targeting of police in Dallas. But the truth is that they have been happening all along. We just stopped paying attention. Mother Jones gathers data on mass shootings and has pretty strict criteria for inclusion: The shooting must happen in a public place and result in three or more deaths. This leaves out many incidents in which people are only injured, such as the shooting of 10 people in Philadelphia last month, or those that take place on on private property, such as the recent killing of eight people in Mississippi during a domestic violence shooting spree. (The Gun Violence Archive collects incidents that involve the shooting of two or more victims. It is voluminous.) According to the Mother Jones criteria, yesterday's Virginia shooting doesn't even count since it didn't meet the death threshold. The San Francisco UPS shooting does, bring the total of such mass shootings to six so far this year. Let's recap, in reverse chronological order: On June 7, a 24-year-old grocery worker in Pennsylvania fatally shot three co-workers with a shotgun, then turned the gun on himself. On June 5, a 45-year-old man in Orlando, Florida, fatally shot five of his former co-workers, and then killed himself. On May 12, a 43-year-old man in rural Ohio killed two employees in a nursing home, shot and killed the chief of police who responded to the scene and then shot himself. On April 18, a 39-year-old man opened fire on a downtown street in Fresno, California, killing three people at random. On Jan. 6, a 26-year-old man fired into the baggage claim area at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport, killing five people and wounding six more. Meanwhile, 93 people on average are shot and killed every day in America, many of them in incidents involving multiple victims. More than 100,000 people are struck by bullets every year. President Donald Trump was right to speak about ""carnage"" in America in his inaugural address. He just didn't acknowledge that the carnage is from gun violence. According to the gun safety website The Trace: Using data from the the World Health Organization, researchers found that America accounted for 82 percent of all firearm deaths among 23 comparable nations in 2010. Ninety percent of women killed by guns in the study were in the U.S., as were 91 percent of children under 15. Wednesday's shooting in Alexandria was particularly troubling because it appears to have been politically motivated. The accused shooter was an active left-winger who apparently had come to the conclusion that the Republicans had to be ""destroyed"" and he targeted GOP officials. We don't know the whole story yet, but he had previously been charged with domestic violence and shooting his guns in a residential area. We are in a volatile period in this country and people's emotions are running high. But if politics is war by other means, those other means must not include deadly violence. With all the anti-government rhetoric out there and easy access to firearms, it was probably inevitable that some violent man would decide to make a statement, punish his perceived political enemies and go out in a blaze of glory. We certainly make that easy with lax gun laws and our illogical insistence that military-style semiautomatic weapons are constitutionally protected. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the Republican congressman who was shot and badly injured on Wednesday, is a high-profile gun-proliferation proponent. Luckily, he was accompanied by the security detail that goes along with his office because it did the best one could hope for to prevent a massacre. Still, five people were shot, including one of the U.S. Capitol Police officers. Unless we all hire trained security for protection, the rest of us will not be that lucky in a similar situation. Had any of the Republican officials at that game been armed, as the president usually insists is the answer to this problem, the outcome would have probably been even worse. Some Republicans who were there feel the fear that others have felt in these situations: According to The New York Times, Republicans are responding to that fear with their usual call for even more guns. That's not surprising. If a madman shooting up a first-grade classroom full of small children didn't make them reassess their approach to this issue, it's unlikely anything will. It doesn't change the fact that there are ways to address this problem. In the wake of a horrific mass shooting in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic weapons and required everyone to sell those they already owned to the government. There have been no mass shootings in the country since then. This simply required the political will to tackle the problem in the most practical way. There are still privately owned guns in Australia and sometimes they are still used to kill people. But the body count has gone way, way down since Australia got rid of weapons whose only purpose is to kill and injure many people in a short period of time. On the occasion of yet another workplace shooting in 2015, I wrote about the story of Dr. John Snow one of the first epidemiologists back in the 1850s who observed through careful data collection and observation that the source of a disease in a given area was the common well from which everyone was pumping out their drinking water. It was many years before science discovered the bacteriological basis for cholera and found treatments for it. But Snow's central insight — to shut down the pump — saved many lives: The same solution is to be found with the epidemic of gun violence in America. Of course a ban on semiautomatic weapons would not prevent all murders or address the human propensity for violence. But we would greatly lower the death toll.

Survivors and family members of victims gathered for a private vigil at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub early Monday morning to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack there that killed 49 people and injured at least 53 others—the deadliest mass shooting in US history. Many hundreds more gathered outside the club’s mural-adorned fence to show their support and to remember friends they lost in the massacre. Most of the victims were LGBT people of color. “What you have endured in the past year seems like something only you can understand,” club owner Barbara Poma told the vigil inside the club, according to the Orlando Sentinel. “Except here tonight, you are surrounded by hundreds of others who are like you.” The first memorial event at the nightclub open to the public began Monday morning; attendees wore shirts reading, “Spread love, not hate” and “Remember the 49” and were accompanied by comfort dogs. Vigils are planned around the country to mark the event, and the hashtag #OrlandoUnitedDay began trending on Twitter to mark the moment.

276,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/16/megyn-kelly-and-alex-jones-two-peas-in-a-pod_partner/,"This article originally appeared on AlterNet.  Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones actually have a fair amount in common. Both have spent the last couple of years denigrating Black Lives Matter, Kelly on her old Fox News show and Jones in a seemingly infinite number of Infowars segments. Both have done their fair share to push fevered conspiracy theories involving the New Black Panthers, a group with a fraction of the KKK’s membership or the alt-right’s influence, but a better fit boogeymen-wise for an audience of white racists. Both Kelly and Jones have leaned into the ridiculous idea that Christmas — a rhetorical stand-in for White America™ — is being destroyed in a war waged by godless multiculturalists. And though their styles may differ dramatically, both have made careers out of shamelessly hyping the fears, stoking the paranoia and bolstering the bigotry of the right. In the flap over Kelly’s upcoming interview with Jones, one fact critics keep missing, or willfully ignoring, is that Kelly and Jones are two sides of the same coin. Sure, Jones arguably says more outlandish things from a position that used to be the far lunatic fringe. But Kelly spent more than a decade doing her own version of the right-wing’s dirty work from within the establishment at Fox News. The difference between Kelly and Jones, at the end of the day, amounts to nothing more than aesthetics. Together, their steady output of garbage has helped expand and thicken our current toxic atmosphere, which is now engulfing and threatening to choke us. For evidence, just revisit Kelly’s body of work. Remember that she once characterized remarks emphasizing the need for a racially diverse judiciary by then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor as an example of “reverse racism.” She accused Michelle Obama of perpetuating a “culture of victimization” for publicly relaying a personal experience with racism, and falsely suggestedPresident Obama was going to force communities deemed ""too white [and] too privileged"" to integrate ""whether [they] want it or not."" In one 2015 segment, Kelly wondered aloud if finishing high school and getting a job is “valued in the black communities,” and in another, she derided a 15-year-old black teenage girl tackled by a white cop twice her size as “no saint.” Kelly spent 45 segmentsrelentlessly promoting an absurd conspiracy theory linking the Obama administration and the New Black Panther Party in an anti-white voter suppression effort, suggesting a twin obsession with delegitimizing the first black president and turning a marginal group into a brand-new scary black thing. Also, never forget her insistence that both Santa Claus and Jesus are white, admonishing naysayers that “just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn’t mean it has to change.” Kelly’s resume is basically a catalog of her contributions to a culture of white racial resentment, fear of the other, counterfactual thinking, and right-wing paranoia that inevitably gives rise to a character like Jones. To take stock of the cultural impact of Kelly — and Fox News, for that matter — is to recognize the symbiotic relationship she has with Jones and his followers. Alex Jones couldn’t possibly have become a household name without the work Kelly — along with other right-wing mouthpieces like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity — put in for more than a decade at her old job. If Jones doesn’t open their interview with a handshake and a hearty thank-you, Kelly should be pissed. We’re supposed to buy that Jones and Kelly are not alike, though, which hinges on the idea that Megyn Kelly has changed. The effort to rebrand and reform her image started quietly, gaining momentum ahead of the announcement of her NBC deal. It’s absolutely true that Kelly should never have had to endure years of workplace sexual harassment from Roger Ailes, and neither did she deserve the misogynist bullying from Donald Trump and his supporters that followed her questioning Trump on his long history of . . . misogynist bullying. But the mainstream assumption that those experiences transformed Kelly into a feminist hero, despite all evidence to the contrary, was misguided. It was also fortuitous, and did a tremendous amount to shift Kelly’s image toward the center. So did a few of Kelly’s deliberate moves, such as joining a league of vocal Democratic celebrities including Kerry Washington, Emma Watson, Lena Dunham and Eva Longoria on “Lean in Together,” a feminist-lite campaign led by Sheryl Sandberg. Kelly also published a memoir in 2016, ""Settle For More"", that was promoted in press materials that took pains to note she is “respected by . . . Republicans and Democrats” and has “fans across the political divide.” Atlantic contributor Caitlin Flanagin cites an NPR interview in which Kelly state she's interested in the “relative lack of power of certain minority groups and the fear they’re feeling in the wake of Donald Trump’s election.” It’s an interesting area of attraction for Kelly, given that it runs counter to nearly everything she’s ever done. The subtext of Kelly’s interview with Jones is more of the same. The idea is to put Kelly in a seat of judgment over someone whose ideas are so abhorrent and despicable, so clearly wacked-out, that her background is virtually erased by osmosis. In a statement aimed at taking the heat off after outrage erupted around the interview, Kelly stated that her “goal in sitting down with [Jones] was to shine a light — as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure.” Except that the best way to illuminate how horrific and irresponsible Jones’ cult of personality is would be to interview those he’s harmed the most—the parents of children who were murdered in the Sandy Hook mass shooting, who have been pleading with Kelly for weeks to drop this whole thing. Infowars reached 4.5 million people between May 16 to June 14 according to Quantcast, while Jones' radio show attracted millions more. Jones’ audience extends far enough that he’s come to the attention of yogurt behemoth Chobani, which sued Jones and won a retraction. A few months prior, Jones bowed to public pressure and apologized for promoting a bizarre conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria, a notion that attracted a nutjob with an AR-15 rifle. Jones claims mass shootings at Sandy Hook, the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Brussels and Boston were “false flag” operations. He says 9/11 was an inside job and believes antidepressants in the oceans are making shrimp suicidal and chemicals in the water are making “the friggin’ frogs gay.” Jones may well be in need of something — a mental health intervention, anger management classes or a new best friend. But what he does not need is access to a wider audience, especially since the president is one of his biggest fans. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump called into Jones’ radio show and praised the host as “amazing,” promising “I will not let you down.” Now Infowars has White House press credentials and the president’s ear. “Have you seen how the president sounds just like me?” Jones said on a recent episode. “Have you seen how Stephen Bannon sounds just like me? Have you seen how the whole paradigm’s globally shifting and you can’t hold it back?” This is who Kelly is helping. As one Sandy Hook parent noted, it is especially cruel that Kelly’s interview with Jones will run on Father's Day. But the clear priority here is ratings, since Kelly’s viewership is already down 42 percent since her show’s debut. It’s the same old Kelly, despite all the efforts to convince us otherwise. “I have no mea culpa to offer,"" Kelly—who Newsweek described as ""soulless, heartless, shameless, avaricious"" — recently told the Daily News when asked if she felt any contrition for all the damaging crap she’s spewed. ""I had the number one show in all of cable news in the demo (advertiser-friendly viewers 25-to-54 years old).” None of that matters to the Sandy Hook families, who fear Jones’ interview will set off a retraumatizing set of events. “We have been harassed repeatedly by people who we call hoaxers that think this hasn’t happened,” Cristina Hassinger, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, the school principal, told the New York Times. “When there is going to be such a widely available interview with attention given to one of the hoaxer ringleaders, it is going to unleash the trolls on us tenfold all over again.” Kali Holloway is the senior director of Make It Right, a project of the Independent Media Institute.

277,https://www.salon.com/2017/06/16/more-guns-is-not-the-answer-to-mass-shootings-or-violence-against-women,"Within hours of Wednesday's mass shooting at the Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field where Republican members of Congress were practicing, the Daily Beast reported that the shooter, James T. Hodgkinson, had a history of violence against women. This was no surprise, sadly. Research shows that in the majority of mass shooting incidents the murderer kills at least one partner or family member, and a history of domestic violence is a fairly typical part of a shooter's background. ""There are striking parallels between the intimate terrorism of domestic violence and the mass terrorism perpetrated by lone-wolf attackers,"" Amanda Taub of The New York Times wrote after last year's Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting. ""Both, at their most basic level, are attempts to provoke fear and assert control."" In light of this, it would seem that the smart move would be to tighten laws making it harder for abusive men to get their hands on guns they use to terrorize women and, in some cases, escalate by terrorizing the public at large. Unfortunately, many conservatives are trying to invert this logic to argue that instead of tightening gun laws, the focus should be on selling more guns — to women, who would then expected to use those guns to protect themselves against rape and domestic violence. Last week a Republican state representative from Indiana, Jim Lucas, drew attention when he sent a letter to a local reporter who had written about helping rape survivors recover. Lucas apparently took issue with the article because it didn't put enough blame on the victims for failing to prevent their own rapes. ""After reading your front page article in the Sunday Star about the tragedy of rape, it would be nice to see a follow up article about the thousands of Hoosier women that are taking steps & learning how not to be a victim,"" Lucas wrote on his official Indiana legislature stationery, thereby adding an analog flourish that most mansplainers — lazily using social media to lecture female journalists — don't bother with these days. Lucas is a big gun nut. So critics accused him of exploiting the crime of rape to push his pro-gun agenda, an impression he immediately confirmed by volunteering to pay for firearms training for women. He later offered a half-hearted apology on Facebook that was mostly a repetition of his claim that the solution to violence against women is for women to ""protect themselves."" Said Jaclyn Friedman, a writer and activist against sexual violence in a phone interview, “It requires nothing of men, saying the answer to sexual assault is guns."" Friedman characterized the pro-gun argument as a ""tailsman"" that allows men to say, ""I don’t have to change anything about myself, my life or the culture I’ve participated in. I’m just going to hand you this object and that will be the answer."" Now Friedman isn't opposed to self-defense. She spent many years herself teaching feminist self-defense courses through the IMPACT program. The problem, she said, is that research shows that guns are generally a poor method of self-defense and basically useless to ward off sexual assault. She suggested that Rep. Lucas is imagining ""a young white lady, probably a virgin, walking along, going home from church choir practice and, like, some giant, dark guy jumps out of the bushes. That’s not how most sexual violence goes down. It’s just not."" It's not just that rapists often go after women who are too high or drunk to fight back and therefore incapable of using a gun. It's that rapists — and domestic abusers — tend to target women who know them and often like or even love them. “You’re talking about almost surely being assaulted by someone you know,"" Friedman said, arguing that it's unrealistic to expect a woman to kill someone who, five minutes earlier, she thought of as a friend or a date. “When you’re talking about domestic violence and sexual assault victims, you’re talking about people who are very hesitant"" to resort to lethal violence, agreed Davisha Fredericks, an Indiana activist who helps women escape from domestic violence, in a separate phone conversation. Fredericks is a domestic violence survivor herself. She started volunteering with Everytown for Gun Safety after escaping a violent situation when the threat of gun violence was used to control her. ""If you’re in a domestic violence situation, guns do not need to be in the area,"" Fredericks said. Even if the woman has a gun, she continued, it might not help: ""The man can basically take a gun from a woman"" most of the time. That's the problem with guns: They aren't dogs and aren't loyal to their owner. Domestic violence victims usually live with their abusers, which means that any gun a victim or a potential one brings home will also be accessible to her abuser. That's why research compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety has showed that the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the chance of the woman's death 500 percent. Friedman was skeptical that Lucas really cares about violence against women and suggested that he was just ""leveraging women’s terror of men"" to push for more guns in more places. After all, Lucas is the same lawmaker who in December posted a picture of a woman in a car trunk on Facebook with the caption ""Wanna know who loves you more your wife or your dog? Lock them both in your trunk and see who's happy to see you when you let them out."" A month later Lucas posted another picture on Facebook, this time of a police officer pepper-spraying female protesters, with the caption ""Participation trophies, now in liquid form."" Fredericks argued America needs better gun laws, not more guns, to fight violence against women. “If you can have a law that says, Hey, if you’ve been in domestic violence and you’re an abuser, you can’t have a gun; that’s a solution that stops things right there,"" she said. ""That helps women tremendously.” As Wednesday's shooting showed, such regulations wouldn't just help women either. A lot of men who commit acts of mass violence spend years quietly terrorizing the women in their personal life first. Stricter laws aimed at stopping men who commit violence against women from owning guns would not prevent all mass shootings. But it would very likely prevent some. Unfortunately, for more than a decade the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied against legislative efforts to remove guns from domestic violence situations. It has backed off a bit in the past few years and let some states move forward with such laws. As recently as February, the NRA's legislative site had a post railing against laws that require those arrested on domestic violence charges to surrender their firearms. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, has an A-plus rating from the NRA. He was shot Wednesday morning by Hodgkinson, who previously was arrested in 2006 for domestic battery and discharge of a firearm. Police said he chased down his foster daughter at a friend's home, punched her friend in the face and threatened the friend's boyfriend with a shotgun. Despite this, Hodgkinson still had a right to own a gun and was the legal owner of the rifle he used to shoot five people who were playing baseball on a spring morning.

278,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/05/1669073/-Trumps-London-Tweets-Dazzle-The-World-With-His-New-Classless-Low,"Trump's reaction to the London Bridge attack was over the top, even for Donald Trump. There were, at last count, seventeen different intelligence agencies at his beck and call, and moreover, Trump has a red telephone wired to Number Ten Downing Street and they will tell him what's what in London, if he would only ask. Did Trump avail himself of these resources? No way. What he did, as confusion reigned on London Bridge, was turn to that font of accuracy and journalistic integrity, Matt Drudge. As incredible as it seems, the POTUS  actually retweeted an unconfirmed story from the Drudge Report, which informed lucky us that a ""suspected terrorist attack"" was taking place, while the jaws of leaders and citizens of the entire world, who were getting updates every few minutes from the BBC, dropped in stunned amazement. They'll get used to it though, God knows we have. John Cassidy of The New Yorker has more:  Shortly after that, at 7:17 P.M. on the East Coast, Trump issued a tweet, saying, “We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!” There was no expression of concern for the dead and injured and their families; no expression of admiration for the bravery of the British police, who were rushing into a deadly situation; no expression of solidarity with the British people and the British government. Instead, there was only a blatant effort to make political capital out of an unfolding tragedy. Evidently, someone around Trump alerted him to how this might be received. Or perhaps Trump cottoned onto it himself. At 7:24 P.M. he tweeted: “Whatever the United States can do to help out in London and the U. K., we will be there – WE ARE WITH YOU. GOD BLESS!”He might have left things there. But no. On Sunday morning, he was back on Twitter, making another political point: “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse.” Twelve minutes later, he took a shot at Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London: “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ ” It goes without saying that our British cousins are no fools. They're a plucky lot and after having survived any number of wars, they are not likely to take Trump's cattle-like boorishness lying down. Here's a sample of what the Brits shot back: By then, though, many Britons had taken to Trump’s favorite medium and made perfectly clear their feelings about him and his unsolicited comments. “Cheap nasty & unbecoming of a national leader,” David Lammy, a former Labour minister of higher education, wrote. “Sort of thing that makes me want to quit politics on a day like this.” “Utterly horrid man,” Sam Baxter, a local Conservative councillor from Warrington, Lancashire, said. “Wonder how he’d react if Theresa May put snarky tweets out during a mass shooting in the US?”Perhaps the most magisterial response came from the author J. K. Rowling. Referring to Trump’s jibe at Khan, she wrote: “It’s called ‘leadership’, Donald. The terrorists were dead 8 minutes after police got the call. If we need an alarmist blowhard, we’ll call.” The criticism didn’t have any effect, of course. On Monday morning, Trump was back on Twitter. Instead of correcting his tweet about Khan, he fired off another fusillade of messages about his travel ban, saying that the Justice Department “should ask for an expedited hearing” before the Supreme Court and “seek much tougher version!” Well, we said, ""cattle-like insensitivity -- with apologies to a milk cow named Betsy that belonged to a farmer of my acquaintance in childhood. Seriously. Betsy was gentle and put something of value into the world, unlike Donald Trump. Clearly, of the two, she was the higher being. And this is what's running our government, ostensibly, a fool whose classless-ness and clue-lessness, were those qualities liquid, would fill the Atlantic. John Cassidy's bottom line on this piece was this: “And the President of the United States is working hard to undermine what little favor and credibility he had left in the world.” Thank you, Mr. Cassidy, I could not have said it better myself. And remember, it's only the first week of June in this broken roller coaster ride. I can't even imagine what will fly off the rails next.

279,http://www.theroot.com/will-the-va-shooting-sway-the-gop-on-gun-violence-1796105989,"Just after 7 on Wednesday morning in the all-American Washington, D.C., suburb of Alexandria, Va., GOP congressional members were on a ball field practicing. The annual Democrats-vs.-Republicans baseball game was a day away, and the participants were just wrapping up a successful workout. Nobody suspected a mass shooting. Rep. Jeff Duncan, a Republican from South Carolina, said he thinks that as he was leaving the field, he encountered the shooter, who asked if the players were Democrats or Republicans. It was an ordinary exchange that Duncan said was not in any way “earth-shattering,” and he made his way with colleagues up to Capitol Hill. By the time Duncan recognized that there had been a shooting, and that it was a late-middle-aged “normal looking” white man who had perpetrated the attack on sitting U.S. legislators, he also recognized that it was the same man who’d spoken to him. James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Bellville, Ill., was identified as the man who used a rifle to unload dozens of rounds, leaving the legislators and their aides and onlookers to seek refuge in the dugout or to cover in place in the dirt and grass. Eyewitness interviews described the shooter as being “normal looking,” “average,” “a little on the chubby side,” “probably Anglo” and “regular.”  At the press conference, Alexandria police officials and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe stressed that it was “not likely” that Hodgkinson held any ties to terrorist organizations. According to the New York Times, he did hold some resentment over Donald Trump’s election. This, again, was a likely case of a lone-wolf, again, white man with a gun. While the gunman has since died from his injuries, he lived long enough to be taken to George Washington University Hospital, where the care he received is among the best in the region. His victims are all expected to recover. The highest-profile of the shooting victims is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the Republican who represents the 1st Congressional District of Louisiana in the suburbs of New Orleans. Scalise was hit in the hip, and the surgery to repair his gunshot wound is reported by authorities to have been successful. Amid the platitudes about thoughts and prayers and unity that are all too common after such events, what we’re not yet hearing is some common sense and some clear definitions to call a thing what it is. First of all, this was indeed a terrorist act. Hunting down legislators, even those with whom one disagrees, is a crime that holds at its center the intent to make an example of the shot politician. The logic is simple: Vote my way or this could happen to you. The man who perpetuated this terrorism was a terrorist. Black shooters and brown shooters do not get such benefit of the doubt.  If any black or brown person shoots and kills, one never hears the phrase, “This is an EDP,” an “emotionally disturbed person.” Instead, cue the tired rhetoric, “This thug needs to be put down,” or “Those people practice a violent religion.”  The talk of mental illness is immediate when a white man takes up his arms and turns them against innocents.  Despite that, the overwhelming majority of people who have mental illness never become violent, terroristic killers. But even if we are to grant that this particular shooter in the Alexandria incident did suffer from mental illness, there is still a main question to be answered.  And it should be laid at the feet of Scalise and his similar-voting colleagues on Capitol Hill.  We have to ask legislators, “Can we talk about protecting Americans from the proven threat that is domestic terror?” Scalise holds an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. He also was on Donald Trump’s Second Amendment Coalition, which wants to make it easier for residents of the District of Columbia to obtain guns.  He has also fought to do away with provisions restricting mentally ill people from buying guns.  Scalise co-sponsored the Firearms Interstate Commerce Reform Act, which aimed to remove restrictions on interstate firearms transactions. While the Second Amendment is treated as a sacred edict from the heavens, never to be touched, these are legislators who are happy to change laws about voting rights, equal access to women’s health care and mental-health care as well. These legislators, and much of the media, too, are far too comfortable with the status quo that white men with guns are the prime illustration of what it is to be an American—no matter on whom they turn those weapons. It was almost a year ago when GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky tweeted: Paul was uninjured Wednesday as he and other legislators fled the hail of gunfire while another lone-wolf white man with a gun unleashed his fury at unarmed people who couldn’t defend themselves. It’s time to do more than wring our hands and talk about how futile it is to even make a request for a real conversation about this issue. Congress must absolutely get in line with medical professionals, who explain that gun violence is a public health issue, just like clean water and safe food. And we must all do a better job in calling a terrorist a terrorist. Even if he’s a “normal looking” white man. No one, not even GOP legislators, should be scared of being shot down in the outfield. My guess is that they will up the penalties on shooting at congressmen and senators but otherwise do not a damn thing to make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business having one. Their safety, of course, is paramount; the rest of us not so much. In other words, no.",2017-06-14 16:28:00,Will the Va. Shooting Sway the GOP on Gun Violence?,,368082,http://theroot.com/

281,http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/n2FvNIWKfg0/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up," This is one of those weeks when I have to pull out the “Sunday editorials were often written earlier in the week” sign. This week, the subject that dominates the Sunday editorial page is the Wednesday shooting at the congressional baseball practice. I’m not trying to suggest the topic isn’t important. The shooting itself was horrible, though not more horrible than the seven other mass shootings that happened last week. In fact, the ballpark shooting was still the only topic on the news, even as gunman of the disgruntled employee variety was killing four and wounding two at a UPS facility in San Francisco. So sure. If the aftermath of those terrible moments at the ballpark is that it finally moves America from square one, that’s good. If we stop pretending that one amendment isn’t subject to the sort of curbs and limits that are placed on little things like speech, assembly and religion, that’s good. If we decided that maybe next week shouldn’t be graced by eight mass shootings … that would be really good. It’s just that, in the compressed timeline of TrumpLand, where every day seems to bring a fresh outrage, and every evening provides jaw-dropping revelations, Wednesday morning seems like a month ago. Please, Donald Trump, can you crazy more slowly? You’re 70 years old. Take it easy. Breathe. Give us a chance to properly deal with one simplistic lie or juvenile insult at a time. That way maybe every issue can get the scrutiny it deserves. Unless, of course, that issue is the health care of the nation, which is being rewritten under a rock. Come on in, let’s pundit. Leonard Pitts goes to the ballpark. You felt it with a sickening certainty the instant news of a mass shooting flashed out from Alexandria, Virginia. So it was disheartening, but hardly surprising, to hear certain conservatives reflexively blame Democrats and their so-called “hate speech” for the carnage. … There was still blood on the ground when conservatives began laying the shooting at liberals’ feet. Republican Rep. Chris Collins blamed “outrageous” Democratic rhetoric. (He later expressed regret for that comment.) The InfoWars website cited a “hysterical anti-Trump narrative.” Radio host Michael Savage spoke of a “constant drumbeat of hatred.” But the catalog of who-said-what isn’t the point. Here’s the point. At some point, you’d think we’d learn that rhetoric — excluding that which explicitly or implicitly calls for violence — does not “cause” people to shoot, stab, or bomb. By that logic, you’d have to blame Fox “News” and other organs of the right for the Planned Parenthood shooting and the Atlanta Olympics bombing. Just a reminder that, when it comes to assigning the blame for this shooting—or the next—99 percent of the blame goes to the guy pulling the trigger. Personally, I’m saving the other 1 percent for the guys that gave him the trigger. Kathleen Parker gets that idea, even though she had friends on the field. Yet, we defend our great nation as the best there is. This is certainly true if you happen to be a Syrian refugee or a survivor of slaughter in South Sudan. But is this really the best we can do? I’m not much interested in debating gun control or assigning blame. The media didn’t open fire on that baseball field, nor did Trump. Some horrible guy did. He was apparently political, based on his social-media ramblings against Republicans. But it’s highly doubtful that he was reacting to some random act of punditry or a presidential tweet, maddening though they can be. More likely, he found the impetus to act out his narcissistic rage in the same interior space that other mass murderers mine for imagined meaning. Parker’s prescription for finding some good from this horrible situation? We can’t un-crazy crazy, but we can each try to stem the madness. It begins with simply caring: By looking up from our cellphones and making eye contact; by asking the checkout girl about her day; thanking the garbage collector; doing favors without a scorecard; giving away money because someone needs it more. Yes, we could all tip our waitress more. Or, you know, we could do something about giving people filled with “narcissistic rage” less access to instruments they can use to spray sixty-something shots across a ball field. I’m for both. Frank Bruni and the people who went there. In denouncing the hatred that brought bloodshed to a baseball diamond in Alexandria, Va., some people went ahead and spread more of it. Rush Limbaugh, take a bow. You called the shooter “a mainstream Democrat voter.” What do I call you? I want to be clear about my disgust, but not disgusting in my expression of it. That’s the hell of American politics and American discourse today, with its 140-character emissions. Honestly, is there any word off limits in describing Limbaugh? He’s The Artwork of Hieronymus Bosch, a one man show. You want cavorting with evil? Laughing over misery? The only reason not to pick Limbaugh is that his act is so dependable it lacks that soupçon of surprise. … a 28-year-old North Carolina man named Edgar Welch showed up armed at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. Welch had fallen under the spell of #pizzagate and come to believe that children were being imprisoned and sexually abused by Democrats in a basement there. One of the fabulists who’d spread this tale was the son of Mike Flynn, Trump’s short-lived national security adviser. Bruni seems a bit too quick here to spread poxes on houses. Am I saying pundits on the left are blameless in the case of Hodgkinson, while pundits on the right bear more responsibility for Welch? Yup, actually, I am. The worst statements on Hodgkinson’s Facebook page came from Hodgkinson. The massive, emphasis on the “ass,” idiocy of “Pizzagate” was entirely a fabrication designed from the outset for no other purpose than generating rage. Nelba Márquez-Greene and another shooting that got a lot less respect this week. I am writing this while sitting in a Starbucks in Newtown, Conn., on the last day of school, anticipating the return of one child when I should be getting back two. My daughter, Ana Grace, was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting of December 2012. She will always be 6 years old. She will never give another Father’s Day present to my husband, Jimmy. I wish her death were only a hoax. Honestly, I’m sure Márquez-Greene has important points to make about the ridiculously poor decision to interview Alex Jones, plus the ridiculously poor decision NBC made in hiring Megyn Kelly. But after that paragraph, I was too devastated to read it. Go try it if you’re made of sterner stuff. Carl Hiaasen on good guys, bad guys, and guns, guns, guns. If you think the terrible sniper attack on the Republicans’ baseball practice near Washington was just another instance of an angry nut having easy access to guns, you haven’t been listening to Rep. Tom Garrett of Virginia. He and some other GOP colleagues say last week’s shooting illustrates the need for more lenient firearms laws, not stricter ones. If it weren’t for the District of Columbia’s tough firearms regulations, they say, Rep. Steve Scalise and the other civilian victims would have been able to bring guns to the Alexandria ball field and defend themselves. You thought this wasn’t going to be the response from the gun lobby? Of course this is the response from the gun lobby. More guns is always the response. Hiaasen has some dark humor about the appropriate gun and holster arrangement for short stops, but the point is ... Three people, including Scalise, were wounded in the initial burst of rifle fire. Others on the field dropped to the ground or ran for cover, hiding until police shot the gunman. But following Garrett’s imaginary script, it would be the congressional ballplayers themselves whipping out their weapons, felling the shooter and quickly ending the attack. It’s a scene so farfetched that it belongs in a Hollywood action movie. Real-life gunfights don’t unfold that way. They are scary, chaotic and sloppy. Bullets, even those fired by trained law enforcement officers, fly all over the place. The scenario that always thrills me is the idea of arming everyone in a movie theater. Nothing says improved safety like a few hundred keyed up action movie viewers letting fly in the dark. Christine Emba is in favor of some people talking less in the Senate … the ones trying to shut up all the women. Ah, women. How does one bear their hysterical arguments and constant chatter? One might assume that these kinds of gripes are relics of some mustachioed misogynist of yore, but in fact they’re far from obsolete. The difference is that today the stereotyping is usually only hinted at. When explicit feelings slip out, we often don’t know quite what to do with them. Such was the case in recent days. After being repeatedly interrupted by her male Senate Intelligence Committee colleagues during her probing of Justice Department leaders Rod J. Rosenstein last week and Jeff Sessions this Tuesday, Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) was accused by a pro-Trump talking head of being “hysterical” in her questioning of the stunningly evasive attorney general. The only person “hysterical” in that hearing was Sessions, who was wilting under Harris’ effective, rapid-fire, prosecutorial questioning. Good thing Cornyn was there to literally play defense attorney. ... if a female member of Congress is willing to press hard to get answers and results, shouldn’t she be celebrated for it? In men, such intensity is read as effectiveness; in women, it’s seen as irrationality. Yet in a 2001 survey of members of Congress, the top reason female legislators ran for office was to effect social change. The No. 1 reason for men? They had always wanted to. An emotional commitment to progress sounds better than dispassionate ego-stroking any day. Prizing results over status isn’t irrational — it’s correct. Think about the last guy you worked for who was an executive VP because being executive VP was his goal. How effective a leader was that guy? Aminatou Sow joins the conversation about men who don’t want one. We get it. Women talk too damn much. But men? Men are patient and stoic listeners. Strong, silent, brooding types. All of them. Any woman who has regular interactions with a man will tell you how viscerally untrue and laughable is the assertion that we talk more than they do. Events of the past week have made this all too clear. Take, for example, the thrilling performance from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who — before her interruption — used her skills as a former prosecutor to expertly set traps for Attorney General Jeff Sessions and demand hard answers at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday. The optics of her older, very white, male colleagues shutting her down, however, were not great — quite maddening, actually. And one of the most maddening parts is that the men doing it don’t have a clue how they looked doing this. They think they were patient, stoic, and so on. Surely these giants in the Senate were not threatened by a woman simply asking questions? She didn’t take up more time than anyone else, but she was accused of not being “courteous” enough and admonished to be nicer. This power dynamic is one that is very familiar to many women of color. Uppity? Was she uppity? Ruth Marcus takes a torch to the “Witch Hunt.” It’s come to this, on his 146th day in office: The president, under investigation for obstruction of justice, attacked his own deputy attorney general for orchestrating a “witch hunt” against him. Sometimes my role as a columnist is to advise readers not to overreact, to maintain perspective. Today my advice is to buckle up. Brace yourselves. Don’t tell me the ride is going to get more bumpy. I’m not sure for what, exactly. President Trump firing Rod J. Rosenstein or taking moves that would force the deputy attorney general, and perhaps others, to quit? Firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose probe has pushed Trump to this frenzied state? Using his pardon power in an effort to shut down the investigation, on the theory that Mueller would then have nothing left to probe? Pardoning himself, a move of contested legality that even Richard Nixon balked at? Facing impeachment proceedings, however unlikely that may be with a Republican-controlled Congress? That any of these seem within the realm of possibility is the measure of how unsettled, and unsettling, this moment is. Actually, that’s an understatement. This situation is alarming in a way I have never experienced in almost four decades here. As I (three hours late) finishing up this morning, up comes the first of the day’s entries on the war of the Trump regime against the Trump regime. The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs, high business enthusiasm,.. That ellipses will surely get filled in … or not. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III has his own column in the Washington Post today, in which he argues that America just is not mean enough to enough people. … federal drug prosecutions went down dramatically — from 2011 to 2016, federal prosecutions fell by 23 percent. Meanwhile, the average sentence length for a convicted federal drug offender decreased 18 percent from 2009 to 2016. And, being the master of if A happened, it must have caused B ... Before that policy change, the violent crime rate in the United States had fallen steadily for two decades, reaching half of what it was in 1991. Within one year after the Justice Department softened its approach to drug offenders, the trend of decreasing violent crime reversed. In 2015, the United States suffered the largest single-year increase in the overall violent crime rate since 1991. I think that’s plenty. Did violent crime go up in 2015? Why yes, it was up 3.9 percent from 2014 — though property crimes, often associated with drug users desperate for money, were down 2.6 percent. That puts the 2015 rate at 372.6 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants, making it the worst year since … 2012, and almost dead even with 2013. Sessions’ pretense that the rate has fallen “steadily” for decades aside from this one-year blip is also an outright lie. There are multiple years that show increases over the previous year. Richard Wolffe has, coincidentally enough, a column about Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Jeff Sessions is an oft-misunderstood man. Time and again, he has found himself the innocent victim of dishonorable accusations that he, a plainly honorable southern gentleman, should never have to suffer. Time and again, he has been afflicted by mysterious memory loss that renders him incapable of recollecting important facts about his own honorable conduct. Time and again, his many critics fail to understand his selfless commitment to the law, to ethics and to the United States itself. It was tragic. Just tragic. Especially the part where Kamala Harris seemed to be the only one who didn’t let Sessions protests about his “honor” act as a brake to questioning. Who could expect this fine man to live by the common standards of recusal? It’s quite outrageous to think that recusal from the Russia investigation means he had to recuse himself from firing someone for the Russia investigation. The normal rules do not apply to Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III.  The New York Times on the world, minus one. Many governments must be thinking along the same lines, but few have spelled it out so clearly. Germany did, when Chancellor Angela Merkel said, “The times in which we could rely fully on others — they are somewhat over.” Now Canada, a country tightly bound to its neighbor by history, alliance and the longest border in the world, has declared the need to recognize that the United States is relinquishing its role as the “indispensable nation.” “The fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts into sharper focus the need for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course,” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told her Parliament this month. Oh Brave New World that has such nations sitting on the sidelines pouting about “witch hunts.” Sarah Leonard on young voters, old socialists. At 68, Jeremy Corbyn has been on the Labour Party’s left flank longer than many of his most enthusiastic supporters — the ones who nearly propelled him to an upset victory in this month’s British general election — have been alive. Bernie Sanders, who won more votes from young people in the 2016 primaries than Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined, is 75, and has a demeanor that, honestly, reminds me of my Jewish grandfather. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the Communist-backed candidate who, thanks to support from young people, surged in the polls ahead of the first round of France’s presidential election, is a sprightly 65. What has driven so many young people into passionate political work, sweeping old socialists with old ideas to new heights of popularity? To understand what is going on, you have to realize that politicians like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Corbyn have carried the left-wing torch in a sort of long-distance relay, skipping generations of centrists like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, to hand it to today’s under-35s. And you have to understand why young people are so ready to grab that torch and run with it. Too many people are assuming that young voters came for Sanders and got socialism on their shoes by accident. They’re ignoring the fact that the current form of capitalism is damn near played out. With automation leaning over every job—every job—like a grim reaper, and income inequality grossly distorting the system, the road ahead seems to fork between socialism and feudalism. It’s hard to blame the potential serfs if one of those paths seems more attractive. Apologies for running late this morning.

282,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/16/more-guns-is-not-the-answer-to-mass-shootings-or-violence-against-women/,"Within hours of Wednesday's mass shooting at the Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field where Republican members of Congress were practicing, the Daily Beast reported that the shooter, James T. Hodgkinson, had a history of violence against women. This was no surprise, sadly. Research shows that in the majority of mass shooting incidents the murderer kills at least one partner or family member, and a history of domestic violence is a fairly typical part of a shooter's background. ""There are striking parallels between the intimate terrorism of domestic violence and the mass terrorism perpetrated by lone-wolf attackers,"" Amanda Taub of The New York Times wrote after last year's Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting. ""Both, at their most basic level, are attempts to provoke fear and assert control."" In light of this, it would seem that the smart move would be to tighten laws making it harder for abusive men to get their hands on guns they use to terrorize women and, in some cases, escalate by terrorizing the public at large. Unfortunately, many conservatives are trying to invert this logic to argue that instead of tightening gun laws, the focus should be on selling more guns — to women, who would then expected to use those guns to protect themselves against rape and domestic violence. Last week a Republican state representative from Indiana, Jim Lucas, drew attention when he sent a letter to a local reporter who had written about helping rape survivors recover. Lucas apparently took issue with the article because it didn't put enough blame on the victims for failing to prevent their own rapes. ""After reading your front page article in the Sunday Star about the tragedy of rape, it would be nice to see a follow up article about the thousands of Hoosier women that are taking steps & learning how not to be a victim,"" Lucas wrote on his official Indiana legislature stationery, thereby adding an analog flourish that most mansplainers — lazily using social media to lecture female journalists — don't bother with these days. Lucas is a big gun nut. So critics accused him of exploiting the crime of rape to push his pro-gun agenda, an impression he immediately confirmed by volunteering to pay for firearms training for women. He later offered a half-hearted apology on Facebook that was mostly a repetition of his claim that the solution to violence against women is for women to ""protect themselves."" Said Jaclyn Friedman, a writer and activist against sexual violence in a phone interview, “It requires nothing of men, saying the answer to sexual assault is guns."" Friedman characterized the pro-gun argument as a ""tailsman"" that allows men to say, ""I don’t have to change anything about myself, my life or the culture I’ve participated in. I’m just going to hand you this object and that will be the answer."" Now Friedman isn't opposed to self-defense. She spent many years herself teaching feminist self-defense courses through the IMPACT program. The problem, she said, is that research shows that guns are generally a poor method of self-defense and basically useless to ward off sexual assault. She suggested that Rep. Lucas is imagining ""a young white lady, probably a virgin, walking along, going home from church choir practice and, like, some giant, dark guy jumps out of the bushes. That’s not how most sexual violence goes down. It’s just not."" It's not just that rapists often go after women who are too high or drunk to fight back and therefore incapable of using a gun. It's that rapists — and domestic abusers — tend to target women who know them and often like or even love them. “You’re talking about almost surely being assaulted by someone you know,"" Friedman said, arguing that it's unrealistic to expect a woman to kill someone who, five minutes earlier, she thought of as a friend or a date. “When you’re talking about domestic violence and sexual assault victims, you’re talking about people who are very hesitant"" to resort to lethal violence, agreed Davisha Fredericks, an Indiana activist who helps women escape from domestic violence, in a separate phone conversation. Fredericks is a domestic violence survivor herself. She started volunteering with Everytown for Gun Safety after escaping a violent situation when the threat of gun violence was used to control her. ""If you’re in a domestic violence situation, guns do not need to be in the area,"" Fredericks said. Even if the woman has a gun, she continued, it might not help: ""The man can basically take a gun from a woman"" most of the time. That's the problem with guns: They aren't dogs and aren't loyal to their owner. Domestic violence victims usually live with their abusers, which means that any gun a victim or a potential one brings home will also be accessible to her abuser. That's why research compiled by Everytown for Gun Safety has showed that the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the chance of the woman's death 500 percent. Friedman was skeptical that Lucas really cares about violence against women and suggested that he was just ""leveraging women’s terror of men"" to push for more guns in more places. After all, Lucas is the same lawmaker who in December posted a picture of a woman in a car trunk on Facebook with the caption ""Wanna know who loves you more your wife or your dog? Lock them both in your trunk and see who's happy to see you when you let them out."" A month later Lucas posted another picture on Facebook, this time of a police officer pepper-spraying female protesters, with the caption ""Participation trophies, now in liquid form."" Fredericks argued America needs better gun laws, not more guns, to fight violence against women. “If you can have a law that says, Hey, if you’ve been in domestic violence and you’re an abuser, you can’t have a gun; that’s a solution that stops things right there,"" she said. ""That helps women tremendously.” As Wednesday's shooting showed, such regulations wouldn't just help women either. A lot of men who commit acts of mass violence spend years quietly terrorizing the women in their personal life first. Stricter laws aimed at stopping men who commit violence against women from owning guns would not prevent all mass shootings. But it would very likely prevent some. Unfortunately, for more than a decade the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied against legislative efforts to remove guns from domestic violence situations. It has backed off a bit in the past few years and let some states move forward with such laws. As recently as February, the NRA's legislative site had a post railing against laws that require those arrested on domestic violence charges to surrender their firearms. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority whip, has an A-plus rating from the NRA. He was shot Wednesday morning by Hodgkinson, who previously was arrested in 2006 for domestic battery and discharge of a firearm. Police said he chased down his foster daughter at a friend's home, punched her friend in the face and threatened the friend's boyfriend with a shotgun. Despite this, Hodgkinson still had a right to own a gun and was the legal owner of the rifle he used to shoot five people who were playing baseball on a spring morning.

For the next week, I spent all my time running between TV and radio studios here in Washington, D.C., doing interviews with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Chuck Todd and fellow panelist Tom Brokaw on NBC’s Meet the Press, on ABC News Nightline and National Public Radio, as well as on overseas networks like Al-Jazeera English (twice in three days) and CCTV, the largest English-language television news network in China. That was just in one week alone. Then, just as I was finishing my revisions on the book, news broke about the December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, where a husband and wife Muslim couple named Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik murdered fourteen people in cold blood during a holiday party for the San Bernardino County health department where the husband worked. As the American public reeled from the latest explosion of mass violence—this one in an otherwise unremarkable suburban California community—the media was once again dominated by discussion of the purported “Muslim” nature of the mass murder. Lost in the all the frantic chatter about San Bernardino was the revelation that the male shooter, Rizwan Farook, had stopped going to mosque over two years prior to the bloodbath, and that one of his victims was a female Muslim colleague who actually attended the same mosque as the shooter once did. It also turned out that the killer’s own brother, Raheel Farook, is a decorated US Navy veteran, who has been awarded the National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. As with the Paris attacks less than three weeks before, I was again swept up in the media frenzy, asked to appear yet again on CNN, BBC World News, Al-Jazeera English, NPR, and ABC. Again, that was in just one week after San Bernardino. Welcome to the life of a Muslim public intellectual in post-9/11, post-Paris, post-San Bernardino, and post-whatever-comes-next-in-the-world. When irresponsible political leaders and media talking heads rush to demonize Islam and lump all Muslims—all 1.7 billion of us—with murderous terrorists, it falls to a few “go-to” professional Muslim public intellectuals like me to try to talk America down from that precipice ledge of hysteria. We’re not all terrorists, we’re a peace-loving religion, we condemn the destruction of innocent lives. And so on, and so on, and so on . . . My life really began at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on September 11, 2001. Because that was the exact moment in time when my country was attacked by people who simultaneously also hijacked my religion. Ever since that fateful day, it would be accurate to say that my entire existence has revolved around presenting a genuine Muslim voice in the mainstream media at a time in modern history when so much of the global narrative about Islam and Muslims revolves around olive-skinned, gun-toting bearded men who look a lot like Osama bin Laden. The remainder of my life will probably turn into one big absurd game of TV musical chairs and YouTube video clips, as I sit in one media “hot seat” after the next, trying my best to inform the public that 1.7 billion mainstream Muslims will not be represented by bobble-­headed terrorists with idiot names like Boko Haram and ISIS. During my numerous media interviews following Paris and San Bernardino, I tried to highlight that in the year 2015 alone, there were over 350 mass shootings in the United States and that 99 percent of these mass shootings were not committed by Muslims. There is nothing “Islamic” about acts of vicious mayhem and wanton murder like Paris and San Bernardino, I say again and again into cameras and microphones around the world. Those who have killed innocent people in places like Paris, London, and Madrid—as well as in more remote places like Mali, Nigeria, and Kenya that the Western media don’t seem quite as concerned about—are nothing more than godless maniacs, who often wantonly kill more Muslims than they do members of other religions. No matter where these terrorists do their sinister work, I loudly declaim whenever I’m interviewed, these brainwashed idiots have clearly lost their bloody minds and are committing irreligious acts of mass murder that have nothing to do with the true mainstream teachings of a 1,400-year-old religion called Islam, which over a billion and a half people throughout the world practice peacefully every day. I have repeated this message again and again, year after year—as do other “go-to” Muslim public intellectuals favored by the media, like my good friend, the best-selling author Reza Aslan. But I have come to despair that anyone is actually listening to us. Whenever some violent lunatic snaps and claims some kind of warped justification for his murderous acts as a so-called Muslim warrior, it’s not his damaged childhood or the flood of assault weapons in America or the climate of unrelenting violence in our country that gets blamed—it’s Islam, an ancient, Abrahamic religion with centuries of civilizational contributions (like the invention of algebra and medical anesthesia) and peaceful coexistence with diverse peoples around the world. This collective response to atrocities like Paris and San Bernardino has become so reflexive within our Western culture that we don’t even question its fundamental absurdity. To see the obviously unfair and unreasonable terrorism double standard at work here, all one has to do is compare the coverage of these terror incidents with the explosions of violence perpetrated by madmen like Robert Dear, the anti-abortion Christian terrorist who shot up the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado around the same time as Paris and San Bernardino because of his own warped religious ideology. Dear was known for strongly espousing fundamentalist Christian beliefs. His ex-wife once testified in court that he “claims to be a Christian and is extremely evangelistic. . . . He says that as long as he believes he will be saved, he can do whatever he pleases.” In his own deranged mind, Dear’s actions were undoubtedly justified by his warped version of Christianist ideology. And, yet, following Robert Dear’s bloody rampage, TV news producers did not feel compelled to book Christian preachers or prominent Protestants and Catholics on their shows and ask them to condemn the Planned Parenthood attack as an act of Christian terrorism. It should also be noted that Dear’s violent actions were directed against Planned Parenthood, an organization that had been recently demonized in the overheated Republican presidential campaign as a group that peddled “baby parts.” Dear even made reference to this false and inflammatory political charge as he went about his homicidal mission that day. But again, Dear’s murder spree was not covered by the media as an act of terrorism, even though it clearly had a politicized target. Or consider Dylann Roof—the twenty-one-year-old white supremacist who a few months earlier, on the evening of June 17, 2015, walked into the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, with a .45-caliber Glock handgun. After sitting with the black church’s congregants for over an hour during their Bible study class, Roof then proceeded to systematically execute nine African-American worshippers in cold blood, including South Carolina state senator Clementa Pinckney, whom he specifically had asked for by name before committing this savage act of domestic terrorism. By his own admission, Dylann Roof’s act was racially motivated since he had stated that he wanted to start a “race war” before his terrorist rampage. Before opening fire, Roof had told his innocent victims, “I have to do it. . . . You rape our women and you’re taking over our country.” In a photograph he posted on social media, the gunman wore the flags of formerly white-ruled apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia. His friends described him as a person who regularly made racist remarks and his roommate admitted that Roof was planning something like his massacre of black churchgoers for six months before he walked into the Charleston prayer meeting. But, like anti-abortion religious zealot Robert Dear, Dylann Roof was never called a terrorist in the media either. In fact, after his act of bloody mayhem, Roof was treated with remarkable care by the arresting police officers, who took him to a Burger King before booking him when he complained he was hungry. It is not hard to imagine how the police in South Carolina would have responded if a black gunman or a shooter fitting the “Muslim terrorist” profile had walked into a prayer meeting at a white church and shot up the congregation. Simply put, the term “terrorism” has come to be applied within our Western societies only when Muslims commit acts of mass murder. And the so-called war on terror has come to justify rising levels of violence and persecution aimed at Muslims at home and abroad. But the truth is, whether it is a mass shooting at a holiday party in San Bernardino or a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado or a black church in South Carolina, these are all acts of American terrorism. The perpetrators in all three cases were Americans and their innocent victims represented the rainbow diversity of America, including men and women of all races, religions, and ethnicities. The killers were driven to act not just by their own damaged psyches, but out of some warped response to the tensions within American society. And they all were able to commit mass murder because of America’s fatal addiction to guns. Terrorism is not the exclusive property of those who claim to embrace Islam. Horrifying acts of violence against innocent civilians have been inflicted by a wide range of individuals (and government officials) who claim all sorts of lofty justification for their vile acts of murder. And yet it is Islam that has become exclusively conflated with terrorism in the public mind. This dangerously skewed image of Muslims began to take hold in America after 9/11 and has only become worse, particularly during the savage primary season of 2016 Republican presidential politics, when Muslim-bashing became standard fare on the campaign trail. A few years ago, the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies released a comprehensive public opinion study entitled “Muslim Americans: Faith, Freedom, and the Future,” which gave a fascinating look at how Muslim Americans were viewed by other religious groups in the United States nearly a decade after 9/11. Since this book posits that Islam is certainly the most misunderstood (and vilified) religion in America today, it should come as little surprise that this Gallup study found that over 37 percent of American Protestants, 35 percent of Catholics, and 32 percent of Mormons across the United States believed that Muslim Americans are “not loyal citizens to America.” In contrast, many people might be surprised to learn that over 80 percent of Jewish Americans showed solidarity with followers of Islam, telling the Gallup pollsters that American Muslims are actually loyal citizens and not a threat to the United States. Furthermore, according to this Gallup study, nearly 60 percent of American Muslims stated that they experienced overt prejudice from other Americans. (Nearly 66 percent of Jewish Americans, who historically have felt the same sting of prejudice, agreed that most Americans harbor some bias against Muslims in general.) In addition, nearly half of the American Muslims polled in the report declared that they had faced some form of “racial profiling or religious discrimination” within the last year alone. Since this poll was conducted by Gallup in 2011, the situation has only grown grimmer since that time. Following the San Bernardino mayhem, a mosque in a nearby community was firebombed and other Islamic religious centers across the country became targets of a new wave of anti-Muslim violence. According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, the average number of monthly hate crimes against Muslims—including arsons and vandalism aimed at Islamic institutions, death threats, and assaults on hijab-wearing women and others—has tripled since the Paris and San Bernardino terror attacks. Hours after the shootings in San Bernardino, reported The New York Times, “kill Muslims” became the top Google search in California with the word “Muslims” in it, as well as one of the most popular search requests nationwide. Because of increased Islamophobia in the West today, many young Muslims in the United States and Europe now feel like “strangers in a strange land” in the countries of their birth—simply because of their brown skin, foreign-sounding names, and Islamic religious affiliation. Here in America, at least thirty out of fifty states have proposed some kind of discriminatory “anti-Sharia” legislation, as a result of fear campaigns based on the absurd notion that the American legal system is in danger of being replaced by traditional Islamic laws. We have seen hate campaigns going viral, like that of the publicity-hungry, Quran-burning pastor in Florida who looks like a wild-eyed character straight out of ""Sons of Anarchy."" We have witnessed “anti-mosque” movements popping up everywhere from Sheboygan, Wisconsin, to Temecula, California, trying to stop houses of worship being built by local citizens. And, most tragically, we have seen death threats and hate crimes directed against Muslim Americans simply because of their faith all across the country. The inflamed anti-Muslim rhetoric that now fills the airwaves only raises the level of danger. This hate language spews from across the political spectrum—whether it comes from 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his outrageous calls for registering American Muslims and banning all members of the Islamic faith from entering the United States, or from self-proclaimed “liberal” comedian Bill Maher, who routinely disparages Islam as a backward and dangerous religion and invites anti-Muslim propagandists on his HBO show, ""Real Time,"" to do the same. There is one very simple message that I would like to convey to every Islamophobe on behalf of world peace. Your inflammatory statements only help to increase recruitment for groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda, because these militants will play your vicious and derogatory video clips to young and disenfranchised potential recruits to prove that the Western world hates Muslims. What do you think you are accomplishing by venting your ill-informed and poisonous opinions? You are certainly not making it any easier for the vast majority of mainstream and level-headed Muslim thought leaders who are trying their hardest to keep an already very heated situation from boiling over. When you make stupid, bigoted, and xenophobic statements like “All Muslims are evil” or “Islam is a wicked religion,” you have joined our enemies on the dark side, where you all feel free to wallow in the basest of human emotions. And by the way, when crazed jihadists do decide to strike out against perceived Western injustices by killing innocent people, it is predominantly Muslim civilians themselves who suffer the most—not the people tuning in to right-wing talk radio in America. Most studies show that over 90 percent of jihadi terrorist victims worldwide are Muslims themselves. This is why it must be shouted from the rooftops and minarets of the world that there is no other group in the world who hates violent Islamists more than mainstream Muslims ourselves. Not only are these self-proclaimed “holy warriors” simply mass-murdering criminals with no sense of humanity, but they have tried to steal a beautiful faith that comforts millions around the world in order to further their perverted agenda. On behalf of Muslims worldwide, I tell my fellow Americans: you simply cannot hate these murderers more than we ourselves hate them. As a prominent Muslim journalist, this is why I am so determined to shift the narrative away from these killers with their repulsive spectacles of violence and focus on the achievements of our diverse Muslim communities around the world. We need to highlight the many Muslims who do amazing things—like Malala Yousufzai, Shirin Ebadi, Mohamed El-Baradei, Tawakkul Karman, and Mohammed Younus, who have won five out of the last twelve Nobel Peace Prizes. We need to highlight the work of the next generation of forward-thinking Islamic religious scholars like Egypt’s Moez Masoud, Khalid Latif, and Suhaib Webb from the United States, and Yemen’s Habib Ali Jifri—thinkers who can effectively speak to the new generation of Muslims. We also need our Western Muslim celebrities, athletes, and entrepreneurs—such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Muhammad Ali, Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, and Salman Khan—to help show our alienated Western Muslim youth that there are many different ways that you can contribute to society without having to join dystopic death cults posing as true believers. As one of these diverse, mainstream voices from the new generation of Muslim thought leaders, I will continue to do my part. I will continue to take my proverbial hot seat in frigid television studios, where I will keep countering the messages of hate and intolerance coming from all directions, including the illiberal left and the neoconservative right. And I will continue to wonder if God will ever forgive us for what we have done to each other.  Copyright © 2021 Salon.com, LLC.

284,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/2EvBtPQI6-k/stephen-colbert-offers-rare-sincere-trump-praise-after-shooting,"SEARCH In the aftermath of an attack on Congressional Republicans, the ‘Late Show’ host had some kind words for President Trump. Senior Writer Stephen Colbert skipped his usual cold open sketch Wednesday and instead began his show on a serious note. “Ladies and gentlemen, before we get started, I just want to take a moment to talk about the attack today in Alexandria, Virginia,” the Late Show host said, referring to the shooting that left Republican Congressman Steve Scalise gravely injured. “Once again, we're all shocked in mind and soul by a mass shooting, this time targeting, apparently, Republican congressmen, and I pray to God that everyone pulls through,” Colbert continued. “Violence of any kind is never justified and is the last refuge of the incompetent. Thankfully, none of the members or their staff or police were killed today.” “And I will say this: Even in the horror of this day, there was reason to take heart in bipartisan responses like this,” playing clips of the messages from Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan on the floor of the House. He even offered up some rare praise for President Donald Trump himself. “So I just want to say thank you to the congressional leadership and to the president for responding to this act of terror in a way that gives us hope that whatever our differences, we will always be the United States of America,” Colbert said. “Thank you for that.” Colbert’s first guest, Daily Show host Trevor Noah, also offered up his thoughts on the day’s events, echoing some of the message he expressed earlier in the night on his own show. “It was great to see people from both sides seeing this and uniting under the banner of human, and American, before anything else,” Noah said. “That’s one of the things that we’re seeing less and less of in society today, it feels like.” Something he sees “lacking in American politics,” is people on both sides of the aisle demonstrating that they can be “friends” in addition to being political rivals. Noah said members of Congress, not to mention the president, could do a better job of telling people, “We can fight, you can fight, but don’t forget at your core, you are Americans.”",2017-06-15 03:00:00,"Stephen Colbert Offers Rare, Sincere Trump Praise After Shooting",,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
285,http://feeds.dailykos.com/~r/dailykos/index/~3/ar7o7Z6QM6c/-The-state-of-my-dangerous-liberal-rhetoric-will-remain-strong-and-loud,"A tragedy occurred this week, even though as I type this there were no fatal casualties other than the shooter himself, it needs to be noted that the Alexandria attack on congressional Republicans was a tragedy by any means or measurement. I can say without hesitation or reservation that we all hope the  best for those who were injured and wounded in this incident. But it also should be noted that there is very good reason to look askance at the newfound desire from Republicans for a “pause” on extreme and harsh political rhetoric in reaction to this event.  They argue that the blame for this shooting lies with the “Hate” that is being fostered by liberals for conservatives.  They say the source of the problem is that liberals just won’t shut up and leave our poor, poor snowflake conservative Congress critters alone. I for one am here to tell you I have absolutely no intention of doing that, and I have plenty of reasons why not. First of all, it’s not like this is really a new argument the GOP has decided to put forward following this shooting. Just a few days prior, Eric Trump railed about the “hate” that has been heaped on him and his father following a report that The Donald had been skimming money from Eric’s charity foundation directly into his own pockets. In reviewing filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, it's clear that the course wasn't free--that the Trump Organization received payments for its use, part of more than $1.2 million that has no documented recipients past the Trump Organization. Golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one-day golf tournament. Additionally, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which has come under previous scrutiny for self-dealing and advancing the interests of its namesake rather than those of charity, apparently used the Eric Trump Foundation to funnel $100,000 in donations into revenue for the Trump Organization. Eric’s response to this report, which came from that dirty rotten hippy publication Forbes, was to argue that “All Morality is gone” and “these are not even people.” But it’s actually more telling to listen to what else he said because he made this not just personal, but into a specific target attack on the entire Democratic agenda in general.  Asked by host Hannity, “Don’t you wish you went to Washington so you could deal with this everyday?” the president’s son sneered at Democrats. “I’ve never seen hatred like this, ” he responded. “To me, they’re not even people. It is so so sad.” “Morality is just gone,” he continued. “Morals have flown out the window. We deserve so much better than this as a country. It’s so sad — you see the Democratic Party and they are imploding. They’re imploding, they have no message. You see the head of the DNC who is a total whack-job. There’s no leadership there. And so what do they do? They become obstructionists because they have no message of their own.” Democrats are obstructionists because they have no message of their own?  Frankly, the Republicans and the president haven’t even taken the first steps to try and reach out to Democrats on anything. Dems actually do have some fairly specific proposals on healthcare, but instead congressional Republicans passed a bill without their input despite a horrible CBO score and now the Senate Republicans are doing the same thing almost literally under the cover of night using a secret bill that no one has even seen. I would argue that our agenda is to remain part of the Paris Climate Accord, to further investments in, and support of, clean and renewable energy sources rather than gut them as Trump has threatened, to retain and repair the Affordable Care Act rather than repeal it, to strive to make college affordable if not free, to address the opioid crises by increasing access to treatment rather than cutting that funding, to increase mobility for workers who’ve lost their jobs by helping them retrain for newly emerging industries rather than cutting that funding or gutting worker safety rules, we would prefer to continue to investigate and reform abusive police departments rather than ignore them and shut down effective civil rights enforcement and that stating our positions  — or pointing out Trump’s legal and ethical failings — doesn’t come from a place of hate. It comes from a place of truth. Most people don't criticize Donald Trump because they hate him, obviously excluding the contractors he repeatedly ripped off and women who have accused him of sexual assault, it’s because they love America and seriously fear what he seems intent on doing to it, and for that matter the rest of the world. But now, after last week’s shooting we have Congressional Republicans complaining that their constituents have come up to them and angrily said that they’re trying to get people killed [by repealing the ACA.] They argue that’s not fair, and that’s just so so mean. Yeah, well, math, facts and commonsense show that between 25,000-36,000 people per year will likely die if the ACA is repealed without a viable replacement: Uninsured adults are at least 25 percent more likely to die prematurely than adults who have private insurance. See state-level breakdowns of the 26,100 people between the ages of 25 and 64 who died prematurely due to a lack of health insurance in 2010. Nearly 36,000 people could die every year, year after year, if the incoming president signs legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act. This figure is based on new data from the Urban Institute examining how many people will become uninsured if the law is repealed, as well as a study of mortality rates both before and after the state of Massachusetts enacted health reforms similar to Obamacare. So when people say this, they aren’t being mean, they’re being factual. This is not hate speech, this is criticism. Fact-based criticism. Civility is generally a good thing. But something I think being more civil isn’t what’s really being asked here. Yes, of course, we should focus and be critical of the issues and, where reasonable, refrain from demonizing any particular faction or group. But IMO that’s not what these Republicans are asking for. What’s being asked is for liberals to simply shut up, and then “all will be well.” I don’t speak for anyone but myself, but I can pretty much guarantee that’s. not. gonna. happen. After the many previous mass shootings that have plagued the nation, the complaint from the right has typically been—“Now is not the time to make things political”—when people mention that perhaps the reason so many people are getting killed by guns, might have something to do with the prevalence of guns themselves. In response, they’ve often argued that this critique is an attack on everyone’s Second Amendment Rights. Asking for trigger locks is too much. Asking for comprehensive background checks is too much. Our rights are clearly more important than the lives lost. It doesn’t matter that America averages 33,000 deaths per year as a result of firearms. It doesn’t matter that over 60% of those deaths are suicides by people who are perfectly legal gun owners, not criminals, not gangbangers, not terrorists. It doesn't matter that the Alexandria shooting was the 154th mass shooting so far this year, and not even the only mass shooting to occur that same day. It doesn’t matter that this particular shooter was a legal gun owner, who had a history of violence against women and perhaps that has as much do with his final actions as anything specifically political. We may never really going to know for sure what his motivations truly were. But none of that matters because we have to protect our rights, damnit. Now we’re told that the real problem isn’t that we have more guns in the nation than we have people, it’s because some people have the nerve to use their First Amendment rights to talk too much and that they are just too vulgar.  Talking with Fox News, Gingrich pointed fingers at left-wing “hysteria” that he says has exploded ever since President Donald Trump’s election last fall, as evidenced by Kathy Griffin’s latest stunt in which she held up a likeness of Trump’s severed head. “The intensity on the left is very real,” Gingrich said. “Whether it’s a so-called comedian holding up the president’s head in blood, or it’s right here, in New York City, a play that shows the president being assassinated. Or it’s Democratic leading national politicians who are so angry they have to use vulgarity because they can’t find any common language.” Right, so Kathy Griffin’s joke-fail with the fake Trump head that had “blood coming out of his wherever” and Senator Gillibrand dropping an F-Bomb is why a guy grabbed a gun and went after Republicans? Remind me exactly who was it that invited Ted Nugent—who once said Hillary Clinton was a “Worthless Bitch”and Barack Obama was a “piece of shit” and that he and Eric Holder needed their “heads chopped off” and Hillary Clinton should be “hanged”—to the White House for dinner again? Then again, maybe it’s all the fault of Shakespeare?  This https://t.co/RD5jExTSjc [Don] Trump Jr. retweeted a report about those witness claims, and he also approved another tweet by a conservative commentator linking the shootings to a recent production of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” that depicted the president’s assassination. Because it’s not like somebody thought to do the same thing, a modern day version of Julius Ceasar including the assassination of the head of state, when Obama was president. Except that they did in 2012.  While Delta Air Lines and Bank of America have dropped their sponsorships of New York’s Public Theater over a President Trump-inspired staging of Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” corporate sponsors at the Guthrie Theater had no public reaction to a 2012 staging that featured a black actor in the role of Caesar. I am a person that believes that hateful rhetoric can sometimes inspire negative outcomes, so I’m not ignoring the center of their concern. But I do think there’s a difference between strong rhetoric and violently dangerous hateful rhetoric. There’s a difference between strong speech built on facts and hate speech built on lies, and I have my doubts that many of the Republicans really know that difference at all. They’re just using this tragedy as an opportunity to attack the First Amendment rights of those they oppose while taking no responsibility of their own. For example, there was the time this guy showed up a pizza parlor because someone was promoting a totally false story that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were linked to a child prostitution ring. And I’m not just saying he was there because of that story. He said he was there with a gun because of that story. A North Carolina man was arrested Sunday after he walked into a popular pizza restaurant in Northwest Washington carrying an assault rifle and fired one or more shots, D.C. police said. The man told police he had come to the restaurant to “self-investigate” a false election-related conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton that spread online during her presidential campaign. I for one do not recall Republicans criticizing the deliberate spreading of this false story and finding fault with the media outlets — like Newsmax and Breitbart — that pushed it without having a shred of proof. But now, today we have this: Fox News anchor Melissa Francis then played a clip from Rep. Rodney Davis (R-IL) who said some of his best friends are Democrats and that the House passes a lot of bipartisan legislation, “but it’s the major issues that lead to political discourse that has in my opinion, led to such an uptick in just hateful, hateful rhetoric of all sides, and I stand here today and say stop. We have to stop.” BERGMAN: I agree with Rodney wholeheartedly in that the hateful rhetoric serves no positive purpose. In fact, today it served a negative purpose. But unfortunately, and I’m looking at all the media in the eye when I say this: friendships and cordial relationships don’t make good news. So I can tell you, especially as the president of the freshman class of Republicans, we are united along with our Democratic freshman counterparts to bring civility back to the 115th Congress. FRANCIS: So you think it’s the media’s fault? BERGMAN: I think the media is complicit if they keep inciting, as opposed to informing.  The media are inciting instead of informing? You mean “inciting” like telling people what the CBO score for Trumpcare is? Yeah, okay. I just have to say I’m skeptical of Republicans who claim they really want to stop all the “hateful, hateful rhetoric” on all sides. It’s not like we heard all this Kumbahyah talk when it was suggested that somebody may have helped incite violence against dozens of congressional offices by using a map placing targets on their districts—I didn’t hear Republicans saying people shouldn’t do that. Gabrielle GIffords is who said it.  On April 23, 2010, an angry phone call came into a congressman’s office in Tucson, Arizona. The voice on the line was a male, on the young side, brimming with fury over immigration. The caller announced he was going to “come down there and blow the brains out” of the congressman and his staff, an aide later recalled. Then the caller said he would do the same to Mexicans crossing the border. Minutes later, police evacuated the offices of Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a Tucson Democrat whose congressional district sits immediately to the west of Gabrielle Giffords’. [...] As several media outlets reported, the door to Giffords’ Tucson congressional office was vandalized last March after her vote in favor of the health-care bill. But the event that ratcheted up the violent chatter was the April signing of Senate Bill 1070, an Arizona law that gave local police broad powers to discover illegal immigrants. As shown by the above video, it was Gabriel Giffords herself who brought up the issue of the crosshairs map before she was ultimately shot in head, and five others persons were killed, by a crazed shooter in Tucson later that year. But rather than denounce rhetoric that actually did promote violence and vandalism at the time, instead what we heard back then was “Blood Libel.” An argument based on the idea that Giffords herself pointing out the incitement, was itself a source of the incitement. To his credit Rep. Steve Scalise himself had much better things to say about Giffords than Palin did. Still as a result of all this, I don’t take these fresh new platitudes all that seriously. I really don’t think they’re sincere because there have been plenty of chances for that sincerity to be shown, and repeatedly they have failed. We didn’t hear this call for civility and unity from the GOP after Sandy Hook which Trump-pal Alex Jones says was a “false flag” and Paul Ryan said Obama was only talking about it to “distract from his failed policies,” not after the Holocaust Museum Shooter who was planning to target David Axelrod, or the Knoxville Unitarian Church Shooter, which was an “attack on liberals” inspired by a book from a frequent O’Reilly guest, or Dylann Roof’s murder spree in Charleston in reaction to the trial of George Zimmerman and right-wing rhetoric about excessive black violence pushed by the CCC and often shown on Bill O’Reilly’s program, or the attempted attack on the Oakland ACLU and Tides Foundation inspired by the overblown rhetoric of Glenn Beck about those organizations, or the Las Vegas cop killers who were from the Bundy compound and said they wanted to “spark a revolution” against the government, or the attack on Planned Parenthood inspired a by phony video by right-wing anti-abortion activists, or the Alt-Reich Nation killer who knifed ROTC Cadet Lt. Richard Collins to death earlier this year, or the Sikh Temple shooter who mistakenly thought the worshipers were Muslim, or last month’s terrorist in Portland who killed two bystanders with a knife after harassing a pair of Muslim girls, or the more 1,000 Hate crimes that sparked up immediately after Trump’s election. I’m not holding my breath that things are suddenly gonna get all unity-like because Rep. Scalise was shot in the hip. Hopefully, he and all the rest recover safely. But I’m terribly sorry I just can’t take empty meaningless platitudes like this seriously. Wish he felt the same about poor people. Or sick people. Or this. Rep Chuck Fleischmann, who was on scene, to CNN: Ã¢ÂÂAfter today I wonder whether or not I will ever feel safe going to a baseball field.Ã¢ÂÂ To which I say... That's how a harrased or raped woman, a black man wrongly assaulted by a cop, unfairly denied a job, an apartment or loan feels too. https://t.co/WDwLjTYtrs Sure I’m a skeptic, but I’m not a cynic. I’m not saying there’s absolutely no hope. If the GOP can take responsibility and apologize for their own participation in this escalating rhetoric—the way that Kathy Griffin apologized within hours—I just might believe them. Maybe. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it had came up when Trump was saying ""KNOCK THE CRAP OUT OF THEM!"" to his rally crowds. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Trump was saying ""I'll pay for your lawyers fees"" to beat protesters. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Trump said 3-5 million illegal votes were cast against him. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if they didn't lie about ""Voter Fraud"" while gerrymandering and suppressing the Democratic and minority vote. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Trump said Judge Curiel was too racist a Mexican to make a fair decision. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Trump said Gold Star Father Khazir Khan was allied with ISIS. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Trump said Mexicans were rapists, killers and criminals. And some, a few, were “good people.” I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it they had ever said the same thing to #AltRight bigoted so-called “free speech champion” trolls like Milo or Richard Spencer. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it they ever recognized a terrorist when he's a white guy and his victims are liberal, black or Muslim. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if, when Russia waged a CyberWar against America, they wouldn’t stick their heads in the sand or else #BlameObama for something he once said to Medvedev. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric  if they didn't call the findings of all 17 intelligence agencies and the investigation of 18 different mysterious contacts with Russians a ""witch hunt."" I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if people like Jason Miller weren’t calling Senator Kamala Harris ""hysterical"" for asking Jeff Sessions tough questions. I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if it came up when Eric Trump was saying his father’s critics were ""not even people."" I might believe the GOP was sincere about harsh rhetoric if so many of them hadn’t said Barack Obama was an illegal alien with a falsified birth certificate, an illegitimate president, a secret Muslim, an Arab,  the anti-Christ, a communist, a socialist, a liar, a criminal, a drug dealer, a welfare thug-in-chief, a food-stamp President, was incompetent, was the founder of ISIS, a fraud, a radical black liberation theology Kenyan Mau Mau revolutionist anti-colonial who simply wasn’t smart enough to get into Harvard or become editor of the Harvard Law Review without affirmative action, who needed Bill Ayers to ghost-write his own best-selling book about his own life and father because he really hated America and all it stood for and—when they were feeling bold—was really just another lazy nigger. But none of that has happened. Not yet. We haven’t heard an apology for any of it either. I’m not expecting we will. As a result I have no intention of backing off the Republicans or Trump with what I have to say about them or their policies one iota. I will not be giving them an inch. The state of my dangerously factual liberal rhetoric will remain strong, and it will remain loud. And to be honest, I lied, I’m not sorry about it at all. Not even slightly.

286,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/15/1672201/-Republicans-Just-Lost-Their-Gun-Argument,"This is probably my last post as we have decided the internet / TV is a luxury we can’t afford right now so figured I would go out with a bang and probably offend a lot of people but I’m tired of being PC.  The last 8 years we saw an explosion in right wing militias and how many times have you got into an argument with a gun nut and had him tell you that owning a gun is his right to protect him from the government. We saw protesters show up at President Obama events with guns and often saw signs that read “we came unarmed this time”.  They’ve become so delusional they think that the 2nd amendment was written so they can take up arms against a government they feel is out of control when in reality it was created so states could run their own militias. Donald Trump himself said that if Hillary won that maybe the only way to stop her would be the 2nd amendment and we saw several republican politicians talk about using their 2nd amendment rights to take back Washington. Yesterday all that talk came to life when a nut job picked up his rifle and used those right they threatened to for 8 years. After the shots were fired republicans ran to the cameras almost as fast as they ran from the wounded and started blaming democrats (and of course racist Steve King is the 1st to blame Obama). They ignored all the violence promoted by the man they put in the white house and all his division, they ignored that violence has exploded since Donald Trump announced he is running for office. More Americans have died in domestic terrorist acts in the time that Donald Trump has ran and been president than died in every year after 9/11 combined. Republicans called Obama a dictator for signing executive orders when Donald Trump has signed more in his first 6 months than some have signed in 8 years yet they were shocked when someone decided to take up arms at what he thought was a government that no longer represented the people but the rich and why would he think that since all they have done these last 6 months is 1. Voted to take healthcare from 24,000,000 Americans so the top 10% can get billions in tax cuts 2. Voted to gut Dodd Frank so there are no more protections for people against banks and Wall Street 3. Voted to allow financial managers to do what they wanted, under Obama a law was passed that they must do what’s in the best interest of the person investing with them but now they can do what’s in their own best interest even if you lose everything. 4. Pushing the largest corporate and tax cut for the wealthy in American history that will be paid for on the backs of the working and middle class.  For 6 months everything republicans have been doing have been to make the rich richer at the expense of the middle class and poor. In their eyes the family that owns Wal Mart have a rougher life than the employees they hire who need Medicaid and food stamps just to feed and insure their kids even after working 30+ hours a week. I consider myself pro life (not pro fetus) so every living person is a gift so I do not condone shooting or violence against anyone no matter how vile they are. I don’t own any guns because I don’t live life in fear, to me if you can’t leave the house feeling safe without a gun that says a lot about you and republicans rely on that irrational fear and even win elections on it. That said you can not claim that you love guns because they protect you from government and vote to make it easier for mentally ill people to own guns and fight against suspected terrorists buying guns (both things republicans have done) and be shocked when guns are used. This guy was a nut job, he was the liberal version of the Bundy family with only difference being he pulled the trigger. You can’t claim the Bundy family are heroes for standing up to the government than attack this guy for doing the same thing. Finally the coverage kind of made me sick, it was at least the 150th shooting this year but the 1st to get 24 hour coverage because it was a politician. 2 soldiers die in Afghanistan it gets a mention, 4 children all under 16 were the victims of a mass shooting and it doesn’t even get a crawl across the bottom of the screen. The UPS shooter got 10 minutes just because it was the 2nd shooting of the day otherwise it wouldn’t have got any mention.  I feel for the Scalise family just like I do for all those who are victims of senseless gun violence. It’s simple don’t shoot anyone, respect life as much as you do a fetus but don’t threaten to use your 2nd amendment rights and then act shocked and upset when someone does.",2017-06-15 10:16:00,Republicans Just Lost Their Gun Argument,,115,http://www.dailykos.com
287,"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/20/1672826/-Black-Kos,-Tuesdays-Chile","The list of our murdered dead is too damn long. Commentary by Black Kos Editor Denise Oliver Velez I feel like I should just make a template with “insert name of black man/woman/child”  — select one: murdered, shot, killed, run-down, lynched, dragged behind a truck, beaten, bludgeoned… by a (pick one): cop, police officer, terrorist, white supremacist, racist...you know the drill already. The follow-up on the perp will read in almost every case—no arrest, no trial, trial with acquittal, time served. Keely Macias wrote for Daily Kos — Who Was Charleena Lyles? She Was Shot & Killed After Calling 911 I sat here thinking of other similar cases — Déjà vu. In one of them the cop perp, Sgt, Hugh Barry, is going on trial. He is (of course) being staunchly defended by the Sergeants Benevolent Association. In case you forgot — or never knew, Barry killed Deborah Danner.  She was 66 and living with mental illness. NYPD shot dead 66-year-old #DeborahDanner in her apt last night, allegedly ""armed"" w/a bat: https://t.co/Ahmmz3ahoy pic.twitter.com/01QDNZXFLG  And then there was 38 year old Alfred Olongo. His sister called the police to get him help. They helped him into a casket. The cop who executed him wasn’t charged. This piece by Mike Davis (which you should read) — A Week in the Death of Alfred Olongo speaks of that call by his sister and the fucked-up cop that shot him: She had phoned the police three times because she was worried about his safety. It took them an hour to show up. One minute after they pull up, Alfred Olongo is bleeding to death on the pavement. The startling efficiency of his execution, however, will not break current records. Two years ago, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead within a few seconds of the arrival of Cleveland cop Timothy Loehmann. A few months before, a 15-second choke-hold had killed street-vendor Eric Garner in Staten Island. More interesting to me than the video is the revelation that the shooter was Officer Richard Gonsalves, who’s notorious for texting photos of his dick to a female fellow officer last year and inviting her to a three-way session with his wife. The officer sued the department and Gonsalves lost his sergeant’s stripes, but, according to her deposition in a new lawsuit, he has continued to harass her. Why this sexting criminal was kept on the force, and why the city aggressively defended its decision to demote rather than fire him, are decisions that no one in City Hall at the moment is eager to explain. I remember back to 1984 to 67 year old grandmother Eleanor Bumpers Eleanor Bumpurs was snuffed out of this world for being late on her rent. She owed the city about $400 dollars back rent, which she claimed she was withholding until the city came in and did some necessary plumbing and heating repairs. Social Services called in the police, and what unfolded next was obscene, extremely brutal, but not all that uncommon. A half-dozen special duty New York City cops arrived at the front door of her small apartment, armed with mace, tear gas, shields, nets, clubs and side arms, but finally decided that nothing less than a 12-gauge pump shotgun fired at close range would do the trick. The first blast from the shotgun took Bumpurs’ hand off. The final blast blew the back of her head off. The cops claimed they had no choice. They were facing mortal danger, claiming Eleanor Bumpurs, mother of seven and grandmother, was wielding a butcher knife. They claimed the shoot was clean. The local corporate press took it from there. Many press accounts, informed by the police of course, characterized Bumpurs as being “emotionally disturbed” and “deranged.” Officer Stephen Sullivan who blew her away was acquitted. NYC wound up paying the family $200,000. I decided not to write this as a standalone diary — and to make it a commentary in Black Kos, since I am in no mood to read comments that cop splain’ or white splain’ or drift into “All Lives Matter“ mode. I’m grateful for the porch. You will understand when I close in agreement with Valerie Castile, Philando’s mom.  “Fuck the Police.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Valerie Castile, the mother of Philando Castile, addressed media and onlookers on Friday evening (June 16) immediately after an overwhelmingly White jury found Jeronimo Yanez, the former police officer who fatally shot her son, not guilty of manslaughter and less serious charges: My son loved this city and this city killed my son and the murderer gets away? Are you kidding me right now? We're not evolving as a civilization. We are devolving. ...We're going right back down to 1969! Damn! What is it gonna take? I'm mad as hell right now; yes I am. My first born, one son, died here in the state of Minnesota! Under the circumstances, just because [Jiminez] was a police officer, that makes it OK? Oh, now they got free reign! He's found innocent on all counts. He shot into a car with no regard for human life, and that's OK?   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Seventeen years ago I made a song, ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent."" I flipped the Latin phrase that is considered the bedrock principle of our criminal justice system, ei incumbit probatio qui dicit (the burden of proof is on the one who declares, not on one who denies). If you're from neighborhoods like the Brooklyn one I grew up in, if you're unable to afford a private attorney, then you can be disappeared into our jail system simply because you can't afford bail. Millions of people are separated from their families for months at a time — not because they are convicted of committing a crime, but because they are accused of committing a crime. Scholars like Ruthie Gilmore, filmmakers like Ava Duvernay, and formerly incarcerated people like Glenn Martin have all done work to expose the many injustices of the industry of our prison system. Gilmore's pioneering book, The Golden Gulag, Duvernay's documentary 13th and Martin's campaign to close Rikers focus on the socioeconomic, constitutional and racially driven practices and polices that make the U.S. the most incarcerated nation in the world. But when I helped produce this year's docuseries, Time: The Kalief Browder Story, I became obsessed with the injustice of the profitable bail bond industry. Kalief's family was too poor to post bond when he was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sentenced to a kind of purgatory before he ever went to trial. The three years he spent in solitary confinement on Rikers ultimately created irreversible damage that lead to his death at 22. Sandra Bland was also forced to post bail after her minor traffic infraction in Prairie View, Texas, led to a false charge of assaulting a public servant (the officer who arrested her was later charged with perjury regarding the arrest). She was placed in a local jail in a pre-incarcerated state. Again, she was never convicted of a crime. On any given day over 400,000 people, convicted of no crime, are held in jail because they cannot afford to buy their freedom. When black and brown people are over-policed and arrested and accused of crimes at higher rates than others, and then forced to pay for their freedom before they ever see trial, big bail companies prosper. This pre-incarceration conundrum is devastating to families. One in 9 black children has an incarcerated parent. Families are forced to take on more debt, often in predatory lending schemes created by bail bond insurers. Or their loved ones linger in jails, sometimes for months—a consequence of nationwide backlogs. Every year $9 billion dollars are wasted incarcerating people who've not been convicted of a crime, and insurance companies, who have taken over our bail system, go to the bank.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Carmichael Show, an NBC sitcom that routinely tackles difficult subjects and social issues, was supposed to air an episode on the evening of Wednesday, June 14, that deals with the aftermath of a mass shooting. But earlier that day, very real mass shootings occurred in Alexandria, Virginia, and San Francisco. NBC ended up pulling the episode, titled “Shoot-Up-Able,” in the wake of those shootings and airing a completely unrelated one instead — a move that Carmichael Show creator and star Jerrod Carmichael says he understands but vehemently disagrees with. On this week’s new episode of Netflix’s Chelsea talk show — which was taped the day of the shootings, after NBC made the call to pull the episode — Carmichael brought up the decision himself to express his disappointment that it wouldn’t air at the exact time when he feels it could have been the most helpful. ""I thought that [the] episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way, to really lend itself to conversation,"" Carmichael said. ""A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that's not the news, people will say, 'Too soon.' But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately, these things happen constantly, and it's a thing that breaks all of our hearts."" “Shoot-Up-Able” doesn’t depict a mass shooting, but instead focuses on the complicated feelings that Carmichael’s character grapples with after having survived one. “When something like this happens, we realize that we all suffer from fear of going out, fear of enjoying your life,” Carmichael continued. “We all suffer from the pain of knowing that families have lost loved ones. And that’s what the episode is about.”   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ When armed men entered Ramata’s village her husband suffered a heart attack and died. Her 17-year-old daughter was kidnapped, her three-month-old daughter strapped to her back. When she first fled to Mémé she slept under trees for two months with her six children. She now lives in a camp for internally displaced women and children. All the women here have lost the men in their lives – husbands, fathers, brothers, sons – to the conflict. They built their own makeshift homes from sticks and thatch. There is a water pump but no sanitation. Ramata holds her half-eaten lunch of ground red maize, white rice and crushed mango leaves. It is the only meal she and her children will eat today. The food was gathered by going house to house in the village to beg. “Leaving my village was very difficult. We used to own cattle and sheep, but we had to leave all of those things behind. We had no choice, we had to leave. Even the roofs of the houses have now been stolen.” People have fled violence in their village, often in the middle of night, leaving with nothing, sometimes not even their shoes. Those who arrive in Mémé are forced to rely on the kindness of new neighbours to provide clothes and food. Most families arrive with nothing, and even a battered spoon is a gift to be treasured. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ With most U.N. member nations, including the United States, refusing to contribute toward a $400 million trust fund to eliminate an imported cholera epidemic from Haiti, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has cobbled together another way to get the money. Guterres wants member countries to voluntarily turn over $40.5 million that will be left over when the U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti ends in October. Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed touted the unusual proposal during a public hearing on cholera at U.N. headquarters in New York on Wednesday. It comes as UNICEF and the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization face a $15 million funding shortage for this year. That shortfall, she said, threatens to reverse the progress the U.N. has made in controlling the cholera outbreak in Haiti, which was caused by U.N. peacekeepers. “PAHO/WHO no longer has resources available for the medical and health aspects of the intensified cholera response as a result of the withdrawal of donor funding,” according to the Secretary-General’s latest report on incidences of suspected cholera and the U.N.’s new approach to the disease in Haiti. Without the money, “it is very likely that the outbreak will intensify and potentially spread to other parts of the country, causing further suffering among the population and a significant setback in the elimination plans,” the report said. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ by Justice Putnam Black Kos Poetry Editor  Literary Theory shows us it was Aristotle who developed the divisions between the three broad branches of Poetry; Lyric, Dramatic and Epic. Lyric Poetry was typically sung, accompanied by a lyre in a metered cadence, now often Trochaic in English, while alternating Pyrrhic, Dactylic and Spondaic meters for the refrains. The performances enraptured audiences to such an extent, whole histories were penned by scribes tasked with chronicling the productions. Lyric Poetry then, is a first person account of emotional events that may or may not be factual representations of actual events. In fact, it was Heraclitus who posited all reality is based on a lie, which may explain why Lyric Poetry is often accompanied by a lyre.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ",2017-06-20 08:00:00,"Black Kos, Tuesday's Chile",,115,http://www.dailykos.com

If he’s a white guy, we’re going to have to ignore this. What a waste.” All of the bloggers interviewed for this article agreed that is would be disastrous for all Americans to realize that they are much more likely to be killed by a white Christian male in a mass shooting than by a Muslim in any form of violence. All of them feared it could lead to sensible gun safety laws and support for subsidized mental health care.  In the words Erick E. Erickson, who frequently embarrasses CNN by appearing on it, “Liberals talk about a right to mental health care, but that’s not in the Constitution. The right to keep and bear arms is. If we’re going to serve the mentally ill in this country, we need to ensure their Second Amendment rights are honored, and it isn’t constructive to focus on the daily incidence of mass shootings.”",2017-06-05 08:00:00,Nation's Conservatives Mourn Latest Orlando Shooting,,115,http://www.dailykos.com
289,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/06/14/1671875/-Conservatives-Invade-Pulse-Memorial,"A year had gone by since the worst night of my life. It should have been a happy day, but the events that unfolded 6 doors up from me have made June 12th a very hard day. On that day, my birthday, 49 innocent lives lost. Unfortunately, extremists showed up at the Pulse memorial services on my street at least 3 times to disrupt the services on June 12, 2017. It was around 3:00,  June 11th when club-goers began parking across from where I live — West Esther Street in Orlando. I happened to look out and made eye contact with the two gentlemen parking a black sports car. I got an uneasy feeling when i saw the two gentlemen — call it intuition or divine intervention. When I slammed my door and got cold chills, I told my roommate that I felt something bad was going to happen. Little did I know that one of those men would be a victim of the Pulse massacre. At a little after 2:00 am, June 12th, I woke up after dozing off after hearing some pops. Were they fireworks? Nonetheless, i was jarred awake. I thought I was just dreaming. Soon after, I get up to get something to drink and was alerted by my roommate that “there must be a bad accident on Kaley Street. Look at all the cop cars. “  I looked out and could only see a lot of police cars...then pop, pop, pop, again. I turned on my TV to see local news and saw the Pulse logo on CNN. My heart dropped when i realized they were reporting shootings at the club and there was an active shooter. Around 5:00 am, June 12th, I was in shock and laying in my bed when i was literally knocked out of bed when the police had to blow open the wall in the bathroom to save the remaining victims. Minutes later, it was all over and a historical crime was put to its end. 49 people killed, numerous injured, and 1 assassin killed by law enforcement agencies. The week before, my former neighbor, Howard went to Pulse. He is heterosexual and liked the general atmosphere. It was like a local bar to me. He and other friends said “I should go out and have my birthday down there.” I explained that “this was a younger crowd and that i preferred to be at home.” That decision and the decision to forego my routine of going out that time of morning to get lottery tickets saved my life. What really upset me more is the fact that the shooter I recognized. He, his wife, and his child were at Dunkin Donuts over the past few weeks. I thought he was creepy by his demeanor. How was I supposed to know this was the lowlife would execute the largest mass shooting in US history, literally on my street? Fast forwarding to a few days ago, the Pulse remembrance happened. It was a celebration of life of the lives lost and support for all the victims. I went to this celebration because I am a collateral victim of this crime. I have not asked, nor looked for anything from the public nor from any funds for the direct victims. Even though my mental and physical health are not the same, I would not and could not even consider asking for anything out of respect for all those directly affected. I was very emotional about this event. I had been crying and still am crying today over the memories and my inability to do anything to stop the violence less than 100 feet away. When I attended the event, conservatives with hate messages showed up while we were observing the victims during the 11:00 am service and tried to disrupt the service and one was arrested and the rest left. Later in the day, two short bald guys came with signs condemning the victims “to repent” and Bible verses including about sodomy.” However they failed to understand it was a terrorist attack and that there were males, females, mother, fathers, gay, straight, brothers, sisters, democrats, Independents, and Republicans that were victims. Thankfully, some other attendees and I kept blocking the two chromosome missing morons signs from offending everyone. It did not end there. Later on a black lady came down with here Washington, DC umbrella and Bible verse written on her sign and started her hollering and condemning gay people after a peaceful first encounter with her. She was finally shunned away after she was informed that according to the Bible, she was not the one to make judgement. I finally got fed up with her after parents and heterosexual couples and other clergy informed her of her ignorance. I explained to her that she is “just as bad as the KKK and might as well go burn crosses with them. I also said, maybe she needs to review Trump’s agenda and that she is conducting an agenda of hate.” She finally left with face dropping after she realized that her actions were just as bad as a racist organization. After all was said and done, I have memories of good people from the Church of Christ and the Salvation Army showing true love and acceptance by giving water and snacks to those in need. I also saw religious leaders from Orlando that bound together and supported the victims, the gay community, and the overall community. It’s just a shame that the president has put out such a great example of love and acceptance by calling people losers because they don’t agree with his agenda. The entire theme of the memorial is that hate conquers love. Maybe Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and Donald Trump need to remember that — simply because their agenda is of hate and disdain of the poor, the elderly, the gay community, and the disabled. l ",2017-06-14 00:00:00,Conservatives Invade Pulse Memorial,,115,http://www.dailykos.com

Misinformation in 2016: A Timeline of Fake News (Photos)






Hopefully we'll look back at 2016 as that weird year when fake news stories oddly garnered influence over the voting population of the country. On the other side of the spectrum, there's also a chance we may look back one day in an effort to decode the origins of a propaganda tactic that's continued to be manipulated by powerful and/or misinformed ne'er do wells. Either way, there's no doubt we can learn from the false stories that started it all.

",2017-06-27 16:27:57,White House Press Secretary Chewed Out by Reporter: &#8216;You&#8217;re Inflaming Everybody&#8217; (Video),,18704,http://www.thewrap.com
292,https://www.thedailybeast.com/megyn-kelly-exposed-by-alex-jones-in-leaked-audio-recordings,"SEARCH The Infowars provocateur published audio recordings in which the host assures him she won’t do a ‘gotcha’ story and promises to show him clips ahead of time. Royalist Correspondent Alex Jones, the conspiracy-theorizing host of the Infowars website whose controversial interview with NBC’s Megyn Kelly is set to air Sunday night, has fallen back to the argument of every disgruntled interviewee: “They took me out of context.” Except in this case, Jones may cause serious trouble for Kelly, who he apparently took the precaution of covertly taping in pre-interview calls and, he claims, the interview itself, which he is now publicizing on Infowars and his YouTube channel. And in those clandestine clips, the former Fox News host appears to promise to go easy on him in the interview. In one 30-minute video Jones published that included extensive audio of a pre-interview call with Kelly, the new NBC hire appeared to promise the interview would be a softball personality piece. “My goal is for your listeners and the left—you know, who will be watching some on NBC—to say, ‘Wow, that’s really interesting,” the voice that appears to be Kelly says. “It’s not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.” The thrust of Jones’ overall argument seems to be that he did not definitively claim the Sandy Hook shooting was a fraud, but instead says he merely “wargamed” a number of scenarios, one of which was that “actors” were used to mock up a massacre. In the past, Jones has repeatedly claimed that the elementary-school mass shooting was a “hoax,” along with his wacky beliefs that the U.S. government is behind the 9/11 terror attacks, is spreading chemicals to turn people gay, and that Hillary Clinton is a space alien from another planet. As distasteful and cynical as many may feel Jones’ argument to be, there is no doubt that the recording of a pre-interview call with Kelly, an edited version of which Jones published Friday on his YouTube channel, will heap further trouble and pressure on the NBC host. In the recording of the call, Jones does state, of the Sandy Hook killings, “In hindsight I think it probably did happen,” and at another point he says, “I have had debates where I showed both sides. I believe people died there.” Jones then cuts in footage of the promo released by NBC News in which Kelly probes him about his claims that the massacre was fake, and he replies by talking about the casualties of America’s foreign wars, and Kelly tells him he is “dodging” the question. Jones on Thursday night promised to release a full unedited series of recordings of the NBC  interview, which he says ran from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., saying he secretly recorded the controversial sit-down because he “knew it was all crap,” and that he would be misrepresented. “I’ve never done this in 22 years. I’ve never recorded another journalist, but I knew it was a fraud, that it was a lie,” Jones said in a teaser video, recalling how Kelly approached him about the interview. “God, she was like, ‘I want to get steaks with you, I’m obsessed with you, oh my God,’ wiggling around in her seat. It was all crap,” he alleged. “I knew it was all a lie. I said, ‘Sandy Hook happened,’ and she wouldn’t even put it in the promo pieces. So we’re going to release, oh yeah, we’re going to release the pre-interview. And then when they put their fraud out on Sunday—which I’ve asked them not to air because they’re misrepresenting who I am and saying I’m as bad as Saddam Hussein, or Jeffrey Dahmer, or Charles Manson—we’ve got the whole interview here… We’ve got it all… It’s all going to come out.” “In the past NBC could manipulate and lie, they were the gods,” Jones says. “Megyn Kelly waltzed in here and told me she was going to do a softball interview with Alex Jones… she did the opposite of what she said. We were recording the whole time. These tyrants haven’t figured it out yet, that information warfare is a two-way street.” Early Friday, an NBC News spokesperson told The Daily Beast: “Despite Alex Jones’ efforts to distract from and ultimately prevent the airing of our report, we remain committed to giving viewers context and insight into a controversial and polarizing figure, how he relates to the president of the United States and influences others, and to getting this serious story right. Tune in Sunday.” While it is common practice for journalists to engage in a bit of sweet talk to land a big interview, some of the gushing audio Jones has recorded will be humiliating for Kelly. At one stage she says: “The reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case and I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it. And for some reason they treated you and your family as fair game, and they never would have done that [to a] mainstream-media figure. “I saw a different side of you and you became very fascinating to me. Your comments during the trial just reminded me you are just like anybody and I thought that would be an interesting story to tell.” It is Jones who brings up the issue of Sandy Hook, and Kelly replies, “I can ask you about that.” Kelly later says: “It really will be about who is that guy. I’ll ask you about some of the controversy and I‘ll ask you and you can respond… If there’s one thing about me, I do what I say I am gonna do. I don’t double-cross.” At another point she says, “I’m not looking to portray you as some kind of boogeyman. The craziest thing of all would be if some people who have this insane version of you in their heads came away saying, ‘You know what? I see the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and is more complex than we have been led to believe.’” Probably the most awkward clip for Kelly will be when she tells Jones: “I will personally promise to look at any clips we want to use of you, and have a producer run by you, whether we are taking it in context, what you are saying.” Jones at another point claims that some of his work is “satire.” In another section Kelly says: “I’ll give you the chance to respond, I really just want to talk about you. You. Take the measure of the man. This is your chance to tell people who you are.” Kelly also promises Jones: “If I ask you about any controversy, you’ll have the chance to address it fully. We won’t cut you in a way that is going to take out the heart of your explanation or the real substance of it.”",2017-06-16 00:00:00,Megyn Kelly Exposed by Alex Jones in Leaked Audio Recordings,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
293,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/14/huffpo-writer-for-violent-resistance-to-work-itd-need-to-be-organized/,"REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi A Huffington Post writer appeared to criticize the baseball shooter for poor planning Wednesday, saying “violent resistance” has to be more organized to “work.” “For violent resistance to work it’d need to be organized,” writer Jesse Benn tweeted. “Individual acts can be understandable, but likely counterproductive/ineffective.” His tweet appears to be a comment on the attempted mass shooting at a GOP baseball practice early Wednesday morning. Five people, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, were wounded when James Hodgkinson opened fire on the field. All of them are expected to survive, in part because Scalise’s security detail was on the scene and quickly neutralized the shooter. Benn identifies himself as a “member of the intolerant left” on his Twitter profile, and links to his author page on the Huffington Post, where he is published as recently as December, 2016. One user called the tweet an incitement of violence and tagged the FBI in a reply to Benn. Apparently unfazed, Benn replied: “I keep saying this – you have to take the time to call in to the secret service/FBI et al.” Federalist co-founder Sean Davis also weighed in. “HuffPo writer’s main beef w/ today’s attempted mass murder of Republicans is that it was poorly organized,” he tweeted.

294,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/8UG333R5UGU/,"Democrats have settled on a grisly theme in their attacks on the Republicans’ new legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare: death. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted on Thursday: “I’ve read the Republican ‘health care’ bill. This is blood money. They’re paying for tax cuts with American lives.” I’ve read the Republican “health care” bill. This is blood money. They’re paying for tax cuts with American lives. pic.twitter.com/298DLguNiM — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2017 And former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted Friday: “Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they’re the death party.” Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill, they’re the death party. https://t.co/jCStfOaBjy — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 23, 2017 Her 2016 rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), tweeted a similar message — then deleted it. That alarmist rhetoric is spreading throughout the party, from the top down, as if last week’s shooting attack against Republicans, in which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) was critically injured, never happened. Democrats seem not to care that telling Americans that Republicans are trying to kill them might prompt others to act violently in what they may perceive to be their own self-defense. It is not the first time Democrats have accused Republicans of wanting to kill Americans. During the debate over Obamacare in 2009-10, Democrats told the public that if Republicans succeeded in blocking the bill, they would be responsible for mass death across the country. Then-Rep. Alan Grayson stood on the floor of the House and said: “If you get sick America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.” And left-wing pundit Ezra Klein attacked Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-VT) for opposing the “public option” — i.e. government-run health care for all — by accusing him of being “willing to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people” (original link). But that rhetoric was largely confined to the political fringe. Today, the party’s leaders are accusing Republicans of wanting to kill Americans. Perhaps Democrats believe that by referring to mass death, they are answering Republicans tit-for-tat, after former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin attacked Obamacare’s “death panels” in 2009. But as with the effort by the so-called “Resistance” to repeat what it thinks the Tea Party did to win in 2010, the Democrats have failed — perhaps deliberately — to understand what it is they are imitating. “Death panels” referred to a real aspect of Obamacare: namely, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), which has sweeping powers to determine reimbursements under Medicare, and whose rulings could only be overruled by a two-thirds majority of Congress. There was a justified fear that health care would be rationed — i.e. withheld — from the elderly by the IPAB as a way to cut costs. (Health care is rationed under any policy, but the free market ensures it is rationed by individuals themselves.) In this case, there is no link whatsoever between the Republican bill and the potential death of patients. Democrats argue that death is relevant because the Congressional Budget Office and other analysts have estimated that more people will go without health insurance under the Republican plan. But even uninsured people can obtain life-saving care in an emergency. If not having insurance is equivalent to death, then Obamacare “killed” the millions of American whose insurance policies it canceled. It is entirely legitimate to criticize the Republican legislation for potentially increasing the number of uninsured people. But telling Americans that Republicans will allow them to die — or that they want them to die in order to give the rich more money — is a reckless and inflammatory exaggeration. The Sanders supporter who shot Scalise and four other people was enraged, among other things, by Republicans’ health care policies. Many Americans will recognize Democrats’ alarmism for what it is — the same failed tactic that President Barack Obama used when he trotted out a “parade of horribles” to argue against the budget sequester (which he had proposed!) in 2013. Obama’s scaremongering backfired, and Democrats’ new accusations likely will as well. But to tell Americans, just days after a politically-motivated mass shooting, that Republicans want them dead is worse than divisive. It is dangerous. Joel B.

THE PRESIDENT is at the White House today, where he’ll meet with the president of Panama and then with a number of tech leaders. (Scroll down a bit if you’d like to see who from the administration and business is expected to attend.) TERROR IN LONDON -- THE SUN -- “LONDON MOSQUE TERROR: Finsbury Park Mosque terrorist screaming ‘I’m going to kill all Muslims’ drives van into worshippers killing one and injuring ten,” by Ben Leo, Gemma Mullin, Neal Baker and Lauren Fruen: “ONE person has been killed and ten injured in a suspected terrorist attack after a hired van ploughed into Muslim worshippers leaving a mosque after late-night Ramadan prayers. The attacker – a 48-year-old white man – ran down pedestrians before being pinned down by hero bystanders and arrested by police. “Scotland Yard has confirmed one man was pronounced dead at the scene and officers are in the process of informing his next of kin. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the Senior National Coordinator for Counter Terrorism, this morning said: ‘This is being treated as a terrorist attack. ‘The attack unfolded whilst a man was receiving first aid from the public at the scene, sadly, he has died. ‘Any causative link between his death and the attack will form part of our investigation. It is too early to state if his death was as a result of the attack.’ The attacker struck outside the Muslim Welfare House, close to Finsbury Park mosque, in north London as the area was busy with worshippers who had been attending Ramadan night prayers.” http://bit.ly/2sJEoPt **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh WE ARE STILL AT WAR -- “As U.S. Adds Troops in Afghanistan, Trump’s Strategy Remains Undefined,” by NYT’s Mark Landler and Michael Gordon: “When President Trump made his first major decision on the war in Afghanistan, he did not announce it in a nationally televised address from the White House or a speech at West Point. “Instead, the Pentagon issued a news release late one afternoon last week confirming that the president had given the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, the authority to send several thousand additional troops to a war that, in its 16th year, engages about 8,800 American troops. Mr. Trump, who writes avidly on Twitter about war and peace in other parts of the world, said nothing about the announcement. But its effect was unmistakable: He had outsourced the decision on how to proceed militarily in Afghanistan to the Pentagon, a startling break with how former President Barack Obama and many of his predecessors handled the anguished task of sending Americans into foreign conflicts. “The White House played down the Pentagon’s vaguely worded statement, which referred only to setting ‘troop levels’ as a stopgap measure -- a tacit admission of the administration’s internal conflicts over what to do about the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.” http://nyti.ms/2sriOvO -- WAPO: “Afghan war faces flurry of setbacks as new U.S. military policy nears,” by Pamela Constable and Sayed Salahuddin in Islamabad: “[C]omplicating the picture are questions about how to deal with neighboring Pakistan and balance separate fights against Afghan and foreign-based insurgents. In the latest attack Sunday morning, Taliban fighters stormed a police base in southeastern Paktia province after detonating a suicide car bomb outside. At least five members of security forces and several civilians were killed, officials said. The attack came one day after an Afghan army commando shot and wounded seven U.S. troops inside an army base in northern Balkh province.” http://wapo.st/2rGZlu9 SYRIA -- “U.S. aircraft shoots down a Syrian government jet over northern Syria, Pentagon says,” by WaPo’s Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Kareem Fahim: http://wapo.st/2sOe4Do -- “Israel Gives Secret Aid to Syrian Rebels,” by WSJ’s Rory Jones, Noam Raydan and Suha Ma’ayeh: “Israel has been regularly supplying Syrian rebels near its border with cash as well as food, fuel and medical supplies for years, a secret engagement in the enemy country’s civil war aimed at carving out a buffer zone populated by friendly forces. The Israeli army is in regular communication with rebel groups and its assistance includes undisclosed payments to commanders that help pay salaries of fighters and buy ammunition and weapons, according to interviews with about half a dozen Syrian fighters. Israel has established a military unit that oversees the support in Syria—a country that it has been in a state of war with for decades—and set aside a specific budget for the aid.” http://on.wsj.com/2rH5ZQQ INSIDE THE WEST WING: PLAYING FAVORITES -- “Trump demands face time with favored Cabinet heads,” by Tara Palmeri and Andrew Restuccia: “Every president has regular contact with key Cabinet members, but Trump, who remains deeply mistrustful of career agency officials, has turned the White House into a hangout for his chosen department heads. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has met with the president at least 34 times since he was confirmed in February, according to a POLITICO analysis of Trump’s interactions since taking office. ... “Senior aides say Trump demands facetime with his appointees in part because he doesn’t trust bureaucrats who do the day-to-day work of the federal government. The president shuns them as tools of what he often refers to as the ‘deep state,’ and blames them for the frequent, unflattering news stories coming from his White House, according to two White House aides. But for Trump’s Cabinet members, proximity is a plus. Being physically present at the White House ensures that they have a say in policymaking — and serves as an indication of status with the president.” http://politi.co/2sh7lR2 A message from Amazon: Watch what happened when Amazon raised their starting wage to $15/hr in 2018. LEGAL SHUFFLE -- “Kushner Is Said to Be Reconsidering His Legal Team,” by NYT’s Ben Protess Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Sharon LaFraniere: “Representatives of Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, have quietly contacted high-powered criminal lawyers about potentially representing him in the wide-ranging investigation into Russia’s influence on the 2016 election, according to three people briefed on the matter. “Some of Mr. Kushner’s allies have raised questions about the link between his current lawyer, Jamie S. Gorelick, and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, according to one of the people who spoke on condition of anonymity. Before the Justice Department named him to the special counsel post, Mr. Mueller was a law partner with Ms. Gorelick at the Washington firm of WilmerHale. ... “‘After the appointment of our former partner Robert Mueller as special counsel, we advised Mr. Kushner to obtain the independent advice of a lawyer with appropriate experience as to whether he should continue with us as his counsel,’ the statement from Ms. Gorelick said. … “Among the lawyers contacted, one person said, was Abbe D. Lowell, a prominent trial lawyer whose previous clients include Jack Abramoff, the powerful Republican lobbyist, in a corruption scandal that shook Washington in 2005. Mr. Lowell is currently defending Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, against federal corruption charges. Mr. Lowell declined to comment.” http://nyti.ms/2ruJPNX KUSHNER’S NEXT BIG TASK -- “Trump aides Kushner and Greenblatt to visit Israel, Palestinians this week,” by Reuters’ Steve Holland: “U.S. President Donald Trump is sending two top aides to Jerusalem and Ramallah this week to discuss potential next steps in his bid to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a White House official said on Sunday. Going on the trip will be White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, who is Trump’s son-in-law and husband of his daughter Ivanka Trump, and Jason Greenblatt, a top national security aide. Greenblatt will arrive in the region on Monday and Kushner on Wednesday. “The talks follow Trump’s discussions last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Behind-the-scenes conversations have been taking place since the Trump trip, the White House official said. … Kushner and Greenblatt will have meetings in Jerusalem and Ramallah to hear directly from the Israeli and Palestinian leadership ‘about their priorities and potential next steps,’ the official said.” http://reut.rs/2tiT30O DEM’S GEORGIA CATCH 22 -- “Democrats sweat the details in Georgia special election,” by Gabe Debenedetti in Sandy Springs, Georgia: “Democrats are closer than they ever could have imagined to winning a House seat in the Republican suburbs of Atlanta, and dealing a resounding blow to Donald Trump. But they’re also gripped by anxiety about what happens if they fall short Tuesday. A loss in Georgia’s special election here could leave the party demoralized, with little to show for all the furious organizing, fundraising and spending in a handful of congressional special elections in the early months of the Trump administration. As a result, Democrats are now straining to throw everything they have at Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District to push Jon Ossoff over the top against Republican Karen Handel, aiming to prove they can win the suburban districts that may pave the way to a House majority in 2018.” http://politi.co/2srqj5S THE NEW DEM TALKING POINTS -- “Democrats use Trump ‘mean’ comment to tar GOP,” by Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim: “Democrats are seeking to capitalize on President Donald Trump calling the Republican health care bill ‘mean’ ahead of the Senate's vote to repeal Obamacare, seeing it as a pivotal moment in an issue that could drive the 2018 midterm elections. The comments from Trump, made privately to senators last week, were largely overshadowed by a mass shooting at a Congressional baseball practice and new developments in the special counsel’s investigation into Trump and his associates. “But a senior Democratic aide said the party plans to revive the ‘mean’ comment part of floor speeches, press conferences and social media, and consultants said they craved the image of Trump celebrating in the Rose Garden with House members over a ‘mean’ bill that hurt poor Americans. ‘We will be weaving mean into the broader attack in a prominent way,’ the aide said.” http://politi.co/2sGAnKv -- It’s important to note: There are just nine legislative days left before Congress breaks for the July 4 recess. Senate Republicans have still not released an Obamacare repeal bill for public review. It is crunch time for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to find a path forward for a health care bill that can pass before the break. ALSO, WE HEAR that House Republicans aren’t going to necessarily take up whatever the Senate passes. They do plan a vote on something, but it’s not yet clear what the House will be able to stomach.

296,http://www.breitbart.com/author/brigitte-gabriel/,"Our past leaders, going all the way up to the office of the President, have failed to check China’s brutish rise. If our present situation on the southern border isn’t a national emergency, nothing is. Here are some cold hard facts that demand the wall be built by any means necessary, and no, the President does not need Congressional approval to do so. September 11th, 2001 brought indescribable terror and heartache to our nation. But in the aftermath, a tsunami of unity and patriotism washed over our shores. That wave has long since retreated and in its place, anti-American hatred has spread like wildfire. Your right to free speech has been endangered by an unexpected source, Congressional Republicans. America is a divided nation. Countless political issues fragment our nation, while race, gender, and religious identification enhance division even further. “Do you know you are going to die tonight?” Equally infuriating to a radical Islamist killing innocent children at a pop concert in Manchester, is the very likely possibility that it will not be the last time. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s recent visit to the White House was of paramount importance to combatting radical Islamic terrorism. Before President Trump delivered his Joint Address to Congress, uncertainty loomed over whether he would water down his penchant for speaking the truth about our radical Islamic adversaries. President Trump’s executive order regarding seven terror-infested countries could not be more critical to ensuring the safety of all Americans. Those who oppose this executive order do so at their own peril and that of their fellow citizens. Brexit, driven by pro-Western Brits, have taken could be the very spark needed to turn the tide on an Islamic invasion of the west. We as Americans must support and unite with our kindred blood across the pond now more than ever. As our beloved country remains reeling from the deadliest mass shooting in its entire history, Attorney General Loretta Lynch remains alarmingly clueless about the nature of the threat we face. Since 9/11, we have had 28,135 terrorist attacks committed by Islamic jihadists that have occurred around the world. We know what the problem is, we’re just afraid to say it. You could feel the excitement in the air to finally have a moderate Muslim leader, a woman to boot, wrapped in an American flag appearing on Fox News with Megan Kelly talking about her love for this country and what a loyal citizen she is. Dear Helen Thomas: With a great deal of disappointment I watched your interview, replayed over and over on television, in which you said that Jews should “go back home to Poland and Germany.” I find it both appalling and unsettling Imagine the American response in 1950 if the Japanese government sought to erect a shrine to its World War II Emperor in Pearl Harbor, right next to the sunken wreckage of the USS Arizona.

                    Nsikan Akpan Editor’s note: This study was retracted on Jan. 7, 2019. The team cited a software bug and a discrepancy in their modeling as the reasons for the retraction. The main results of the paper are still valid: The more you’re overwhelmed, the more likely you are to share low-quality information, even if higher-quality information enters your feed. But the retraction means that limited attention by itself is not enough to explain the viral spread of misinformation. Echo chambers, confirmation bias and ignorance. When explaining why fake news spreads on social media, we can be quick to blame the personal qualities of other people. But don’t be so hasty to point the finger at others for the popularity of false information on Facebook and Twitter. New research shows that everyone is prone to sharing less-than-truthful news when dealing with a never-ending stream of updates. The scientists found that when the news cycle is packed to the brim, people will struggle to discriminate between fact-based stories and fake news on social media. This consequence is inherently built into how social media platforms work, according to the study published Monday in Nature Human Behavior, and may also explain popularity bias in modern journalism. “It’s not so much that individuals lose their ability distinguish low-quality information from high-quality information,” said Filippo Menczer, the project’s leader and director of Indiana University’s Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research. “The system as a whole is incapable of making that discrimination.” Menczer’s team has spent the last seven years looking into the internet’s surge of fake news, namely by picking apart why things go viral in the first place. His team has investigated everything from the rise of political Twitter bots to why friends love echo chambers. Their newest study began with one of their earliest findings: Some things become viral on the internet even when you remove the notion of quality. The originality of a meme, the beauty of picture or the truthfulness of a statement did not fully dictate its popularity. Other researchers made similar observations, for instance, if you find out your friends like a song, you’ll be more likely to like it, too. So, sometimes in a social world, people occasionally follow the masses. Menczer’s latest exercise explored the opposite scenario. They built a mathematical model to describe a social media landscape where quality not only exists in every post, but is valued. “We make the assumption that people would prefer to share things that are truthful or accurate over things that are fake or false or misleading,” Menczer said. Their model predicted that people can discriminate truthful from false information, but only when the volume of information flowing through a social media feed is low. Their prediction was subsequently backed by data that showed how often people shared verified news versus fake news on Facebook. In other words, normal people become too distracted by a large deluge of information to take the time to fact check or find the most accurate stories. When you see 10 stories in your Facebook feed, you can still tell when five are crap and five are good. But when you’re flooded with posts, such as after a mass shooting or political hearing, and both your feed and your brain can only hold so many stories at one time, “there are a hundred more stories you’re not seeing that are much better than those five that you thought were good,” Menczer said, according to their model. So, irrespective of echo chambers and confirmation bias, people are not sharing the most verified stories in part because they never even read them. This quality is problematic for social media right now because of an enormous amount of content is generated by people who are trying to manipulate the platforms, especially through bots that automatically “like” or “share” stories. Everyone, including journalists, celebrities and politicians, are vulnerable to being misinformed through these bots or click farms, Menczer said, because they create false trends in popularity, and by association, the news cycle. “If you think that something is going viral on Twitter or on Facebook, you’re going to pay attention to it,” Menczer said. “Bots are retweeting links from or mentioning influential people to induce them to pay attention.” The solution, Menczer said, would be limiting how much misinformation lands on a social media platform in the first place. This particular problem with information overload outlined by this study cannot be solved by more fact checking by individuals. “Platforms need to figure out how to detect these abuse efforts,” Menczer said. “If there is less junk around, then people would be able to focus on actual information shared by actual people.” Left:

Kelly shared a preview clip of the interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday. In the clip, Jones defends against being called “the most paranoid man in the world,” calls the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. an “inside job,” and attempts to deflect criticism for his assertion that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.

300,http://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccaheilweil1/2017/06/25/how-internet-conspiracy-theories-go-viral-and-get-people-to-believe-them-too/,"Last year, at an Orlando nightclub Pulse, as police and the media attempted to process what would turn out to be country's deadliest mass-shooting, networks of people were already developing their own alternative narratives. ""Orlando shooting was a hoax,"" proclaimed one tweet. Another tweet echoed that sentiment. ""More Orlando shooting Hoax - proof - same actors in Sandy hook & Boston Marathon Fake bombing - gun take away agenda."" Before the ink was dry on morning editions, many had already constructed their own version of the Orlando shooting that bore little resemblance to reality. Conspiracy theories are nothing new to the human imagination, of course, but the speed and ubiquity of Twitter and other social media platforms provide fertile ground for alternative narratives - especially for violent events. In the fever swamps of conspiracy networks, the shooting Sandy Hook Elementary never happened, the nightclub shooting in Orlando was part of an orchestrated plan to take away guns, or a CIA plot, and  the Boston Marathon Bombing was a “Zionist conspiracy."" Twitter is a platform where conspiracists can promote their alternative narratives to the headlines of mainstream media, gaining recognition and exposure. University of Washington professor Kate Starbird is studying how conspiracy theories propagate online. Her latest work focuses on Twitter, and the emergence of conspiracy theories after mass shooting events. What she found on the social media site is an ""alternative media ecosystem” - a complex network of bots, individuals and domains that birth, orchestrate and promote conspiracy theories that undermine online readers' trust in information. While conspiracy theories have emerged from human imagination for centuries, Twitter is now a home for alternative narratives of crises. Starbird, who presented her findings at the Collective Intelligence Conference this June, wanted to understand the perfect storms that popularize absurd conspiracy theories online. The conference was aimed at fostering discussion between researchers hoping to promote the public good. Because commonly-held standards for understanding news is declining, making it increasingly more difficult to determine the credibility of information, the internet has become particularly vulnerable to the spread of disinformation. Conspiracy theories are born from growing suspicion that institutions like the government and the mainstream media cannot be trusted, producing “claims that the events didn’t happen in the way that you think,"" Starbird said. Starbird suspects that Twitter users far away from actual tragic incidents are more likely to fall for false narratives. ""It may be difficult to say that the shooting down the street didn’t happen. It might be easier to say the shooting at Sandy Hook didn’t happen."" As conspiracy theory networks grow, they have also begun to influence elected officials. Take the example of “Pizzagate,” a debunked story which erroneously linked members of the Democratic Party and various restaurants with a child-sex ring. This story originated on a white supremacist’s Twitter account, spread on social media and was supported by far-right InfoWars host Alex Jones. It was cited by a man as the reason he fired shots into the Comet restaurant in North Carolina. Even after the shooting, Michael Flynn Jr., the son of Michael T. Flynn (both then members of President Trump’s transition team) continued to lend credence to the “Pizzagate” myth on Twitter. Giving such a conspiracy theory credence “shows these ideas are echoing in positions of power, which is frightening,” Starbird said. Conspiracy theories impact politics in other ways. Exposure to such theories can reduce political engagement, making Starbird's research increasingly more important for navigating the online world, because nefarious actors can promote these stories in order to leverage a narrative to their advantage. The front door of Comet Ping Pong pizza shop, in Washington, Monday, Dec. 5, 2016. (AP Photo/Jose... [+] Luis Magana) Interestingly, Twitter conspiracy theorists are increasingly uncategorizable using a traditional Left-Right political binary. Instead, they tend to fall into an ""anti-globalist"" sentiment that crosses a number of political lines. Anti-globalist content is often anti-corporation, anti-European Union and anti-U.S. government. But that’s not all: ""Disturbingly, much of the anti-globalist content in these alternative media domains was also anti-Semitic — echoing long-lived conspiracy theories about powerful Jewish people controlling world events,"" Starbird said. Ultimately, her research categorizes the political leanings of conspiracy networks into six general categories, which included ""U.S. Alt Right,"" ""U.S. Alt Left,"" ""International Anti-Globalist,"" ""White Nationalist and/or Anti-Semitic,"" ""Russian Propaganda"" and ""Muslim Defense,"" which the study categorized as ""primarily challeng[ing] mainstream narratives of terrorist attacks by Muslims."" Within the ""International Anti-Globalist"" category, ""all [of the domains] contained content that was supportive of recent Russian actions in Syria and defensive of Russia’s supposed actions to impact the U.S. election,"" the report said. ""These pro-Russian themes were also widespread within the U.S. Alt-Right domains, but they were most salient on the International Anti-Globalist sites."" Those reading and propagating conspiracy theories online  had high ""domain diversity,"" meaning that they rely on a number of different websites, from mainstream media to fringe sources, to build the case for their alternative narratives, creating what Starbird calls ""false triangulation."" “People are going to different sites thinking that they’re getting different information, and the same information is actually being presented on different sites,” Starbird said. While online news consumers might believe that they are finding multiple sources to support their views, the reality is that they're often actually reading different outlets, mediums and even authors reporting the same information, often using direct excerpts from each other. ""[M]any of these sites aggregate news, so the same articles (and authors) appear across multiple domains,” explained Starbird. “For example, in our data, there are 147 tweets linking to the article about the Orlando shooting on the VeteransToday.com domain. 100 other tweets link to the same article—same text, same author— hosted on different domains. In other cases, articles hosted on one domain synthesizes content from external sources, often excerpting long passages. So someone can be citing an article originally posted by ActivistPost synthesizing content from RT through a tweet linking to BeforeItsNews."" Bots are another key tool in the alternative media universe. Both TheRealStrategy and InfoWars benefit from a host of Twitter accounts likely managed by computer programs, rather than people. These Twitter accounts tended to use photos stolen from others online, and maintains similar profile descriptions, all serving the same ""botnet."" These botnets were found to have tweeted at coordinated times. Their sheer numbers ultimately bring real accounts into networks promoting conspiratorial content. Conspiracy networks encourage alternative theories in other ways, too. Targeting a conspiracy theory to people who've already fallen for others maximizes the likelihood it'll be believed. Thus, nefarious actors disseminating conspiracy theories to obfuscate the public’s understanding of the truth can easily take advantage of spheres of Twitter activity that already promote conspiratorial thinking. “People who experience one conspiracy theory are more likely to believe another one,” Starbird said. These stories, while divergent in plot, often rely on the same broader themes. According to one study, those who believe conspiracy theories are so likely to believe others that they'll even believe multiple theories that directly contradict each other. Unifying these often-incoherent beliefs, however, is an underlying distrust of mainstream institutions, such as governments and traditional media outlets. Popular domains in the alternative media ecosystem also co-opt the language of fighting ""fake news,"" and even critical thinking, hoping to keep their readers skeptical of the mainstream media. ""The conversation around 'fake news' often ends with statements about teaching people to become better consumers of information — to be skeptical as they educate themselves through encounters with online media. Alternative news sites have appropriated these arguments and are using them to support the propagation of alternative narratives and other conspiracy theories,"" Starbird explained in a Medium post. So what can be done to combat conspiracy theories so that people can reliably inform themselves? Starbird is as stumped as you likely are. “I don’t have solutions right now. I think it’s an all-hands-on-deck kind-of-problem,"" she said. ""It’s a lot easier to disrupt the system and cause mayhem.” For Starbird, the key thing is for media researchers to catch up to the problem, as they are already running behind. ""[T]his work suggests that Alex Jones is indeed a prophet. Seriously, as I read through dozens of these alternative media websites and dug DEEP into their content, I realized that there is an indeed an information war being waged,"" Starbird wrote. ""Three years ago, our lab decided these conspiracy theories were too marginal and salacious to be the focus of our research. Almost that it was beneath our dignity to pay attention to and promote this kind of content. What a terrible mistake that was. It seems to me that we weren’t the only ones who made it. It is (past) time we attend to this (as researchers and designers of the systems that conduct this content). I hope it is not too late."" I’m a contributor to Forbes.com.

        Jim Dalrymple II Last updated on June 13, 2017, at 1:34 p.m. ET Posted on June 12, 2017, at 11:15 p.m. ET An upcoming NBC News interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has generated a massive backlash online, including from the families of the 26 people killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, sending one of the network's advertisers fleeing. Megyn Kelly's interview with Jones — the sometimes-shirtless impresario of right-wing media outlet Infowars — is scheduled to air this weekend on the former Fox News host's new program, Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly. In a teaser for the interview, Kelly asks Jones about being ""the most paranoid man in America."" The clip later shows Jones saying the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack was an ""inside job,"" and that ""30 years ago they began creating animal-human hybrids."" Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies… https://t.co/wkSCc3iYPP Jones is a well known purveyor of conspiracy theories whose national profile, along with that of his Infowars brand, has exploded over the last year as Donald Trump channeled far-right angst on his road to the White House. But Kelly's interview with Jones has generated significant pushback, particularly from the families of victims killed in the Sandy Hook massacre who say the interview will only serve to elevate his voice. Twenty children and six adults were killed in 2012 when 20-year-old Adam Lanza opened fire inside a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school. Jones has repeatedly referred to the shooting as a ""hoax,"" and said it was ""synthetic, completely fake, with actors."" The victims' families have consequently expressed outrage that Kelly is interviewing Jones on her show. On Sunday, Nelba Márquez-Greene tweeted a picture of her daughter, who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, directing it at Kelly. Márquez-Greene then went on to describe the harassment her family has received since the shooting. She asked Kelly to ""shine a light on the parents, siblings and their journeys."" Here you go @megynkelly - her name is Ana Grace Márquez-Greene. Say her name- stare at this &amp; tell me it's worth it… https://t.co/8Oufyc7r7L Cristina Hassinger, daughter of the principal who died at Sandy Hook, also criticized the decision to interview Jones, tweeting ""shame on you @megynkelly"" and sharing screenshots of tweets in which people harassed her about the shooting. This is what happens when you put the spotlight on conspiracy theorists, @megynkelly. Harassment of victims. Riveti… https://t.co/iZgDW7EEgv Sandy Phillips, whose daughter died in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting along with 11 others also criticized Kelly. ""Shining a light works on cockroaches"" says @Nelba_MG regarding interview by @megynkelly with real cockroach Alex Jones. I stand with Nelba! Sandy Hook Promise, an anti-gun violence organization led by several victims’ families, also said in a statement that it could not support the decision to give a “voice or platform to Alex Jones.” As a result, the organization said Kelly would no longer host its annual gala, which is scheduled for Wednesday. Here is my statement regarding Sunday night’s interview: ""It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions?"" Kelly's statement reads. ""President Trump, by praising and citing him, appearing on his show, and giving him White House press credentials, has helped elevate Jones, to the alarm of many."" She went on to say the interview is meant ""to shine a light"" on Jones and to ""discuss the considerable falsehoods he has promoted with near impunity."" While several family members of mass shooting victims noted the harassment they have received since the death of their loved ones, observers pointed out that last week a Florida woman who believed the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax was sentenced to prison for making death threats against a parent. As part of the woman's sentence, a judge ordered she not access a list of conspiracy theory websites, including Jones' Infowars. By Monday afternoon, the controversy over Kelly's interview with Jones had spread, with scores of people tweeting the hashtags #ShameonNBC and #BoycottMegynKelly. A number of high profile figures including Chelsea Clinton and Ana Navarro joined in the criticism. This. Please read this: https://t.co/ev9zm0lYeL This is so painful for #SandyHook loved ones. I can't control what @NBC or others do, but I control what I do. I wi… https://t.co/LjrKehEmBL In the face of the backlash, at least one advertiser reportedly pulled their commercials from NBC News. According to the Wall Street Journal, JP Morgan asked that its commercials be removed from Kelly's show until after the interview has aired. JP Morgan's chief marketing officer also tweeted that she was ""repulsed"" by the prospect of Kelly's interview with Jones. As an advertiser, I'm repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and A… https://t.co/wwuUPe1kzA A spokesman for JP Morgan declined to comment to BuzzFeed News on the matter. Somewhat ironically, Jones himself also said he was unhappy with the prospect of being the subject of Kelly's program. In a video posted Monday, he claimed ""Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came down here,"" assuring Jones the interview wouldn't be about Sandy Hook and other conspiracy theories Jones has pushed. And in a tweet, he called on Kelly not to air the interview ""for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook."" I'm calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook - https://t.co/TfLEPHEYrd NBC News did not respond to a BuzzFeed News request for comment. Kelly, however, has defended the decision to interview Jones. On Twitter, she noted that President Trump has praised Jones and his White House has provided press credentials for Infowars. POTUS's been on &amp; praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; ou… https://t.co/XcgM6rqtJj ""Your reputation is amazing.

302,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2017/06/12/anniversary-pulse-jihadi-attack-media-replaces-radical-ideology-generic-hate/#disqus_thread,"On Monday, thousands are remembering the lives lost during the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, the Pulse nightclub massacre, a jihadist attack by an Islamic State sympathizer targeting the Orlando club’s “Latin Night.” Omar Mateen opened fire on innocent patrons of the club, killing 49 people and injuring scores of others. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State during the shooting before police shot him dead. The media has made little to no mention of the fact that a jihadist, influenced by a radical Islamic ideology, was behind this crime. Instead, most of the stories in the press have painted the incident as a generic form of “hate.” An article in the New Yorker about the graveyard caretaker who looks after the plots of the victims of the massacre does not mention Mateen. USA Today similarly makes no mention of Mateen’s radical motivations or his allegiance to a group hellbent on spreading an Islamic caliphate throughout the world. CNN ran an article highlighting five people who were either related to the victims of the Pulse massacre or survived the atrocity. CNN also failed to address the radical Islamic ideology behind the attacks. While they did mention the word “terror,” they chose quotes to highlight the views of those who believe in stricter gun laws, and one that blamed the incident squarely on “hate.” The one person CNN quoted who believes in gun ownership as a form of protection as a result of what she survived said she does not believe in God. “It’s hard to say that I am here because of God because, I’m sorry, I don’t believe that God would take those people the way that they were taken,” Jeannette McCoy told CNN. “There’s nothing proud about being a survivor. Not for me.” The Washington Post also failed to make any mention of Mateen’s radical influence. As the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, “Despite the Post‘s piece clocking in at over a thousand words, the words ‘terrorism,’ ‘terror,’ ‘ISIS,’ ‘Islam,’ ‘Muslim,’ and ‘al-Baghdadi’ never appeared once. The sole reference to ‘Islamic State’ occurs in a photo caption, and never in the body of the piece.” Breitbart News previously reported that Mateen said, “I pledge allegiance to [Islamic State leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may God protect him, on behalf of the Islamic State,” during a 911 call about his assault. In that same piece, Breitbart News detailed how the media worked to “portray Mr. Mateen as a scorned, mentally ill, repressed homosexual,” but the reports on the incident “reveal one crucial point: Omar Mateen ranted at the police about America’s fight against the Islamic State, mentioning the war and air strikes at least 20 times in total.” Several other news outlets also failed to mention the keywords that the Washington Free Beacon mentioned; their sole reference to Mateen pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. They include a Toronto, Canada-based news site, CP24 and the Associated Press. However, last year, the AP ran a headine with a quote from Mateen’s imam who said the Pulse massacre “Has Nothing To Do With ISIS” and instead blamed it on mental illness. On Monday, the City of Orlando participated in what they have called “Orlando United Day – A Day of Love and Kindness” to honor the lives lost one year ago today. In addition to a series of events taking place in the city and throughout other cities across North America, an event at Pulse nightclub called “Reflections and Remembrance” began at 11 a.m. At 7 p.m., a memorial event called “Orlando Love: Remembering Our Angels” will take place at Lake Eola Park. The park is located at  512 East Washington Street. Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News. Follow her on Facebook and Twitter.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office said the situation is now ""contained and stable."" The industrial area is in a suburban area, northeast of downtown Orlando. The FBI is assisting the sheriff’s office as officers gather in a parking lot near several warehouses.

Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said the shooter was 45-year-old John Robert Neumann Jr., an Army veteran. Neumann was fired in April and had been previously accused of assaulting a co-worker. The attacker was not believed to be a member of any type of subversive or terrorist organization, Demings said. Neumann carried out the massacre with a semi-automatic weapon, the sheriff said at a press briefing. Demings said police are still identifying victims. Neumann lived alone and had no family in the area, the sheriff said. The mass killings come one week before the one-year mark of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 2016 killed 49 people and left dozens more injured. Neumann was not charged when he was accused of battering the co-worker in June 2014, and his previous criminal record was otherwise minor — marijuana possession and driving under the influence, the sheriff said. The co-worker he allegedly beat up three years ago was not among the victims Monday, the sheriff added. Shelley Adams said her sister, Sheila McIntyre, called her from the company's bathroom during the shooting and kept repeating, ""My boss is dead. My boss is dead."" State and federal law enforcement officers converged on the industrial park in Orlando shortly after 8 a.m. after a woman ran from the awning business, Fiamma Inc., saying the gunman had told her to leave. She used the phone of a tile business across the street to call 911, said Yamaris Gomez, the tile store's owner. ""All she kept saying was he was holding a gun and told her to get out,"" Gomez said. The sheriff said officers were dispatched within 45 seconds and arrived two minutes later. The FBI also responded, said Ron Hopper, who runs the FBI's Orlando office. Special Agent Danny Banks of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said that while five people were killed, ""seven others' lives were saved due to the quick actions of the officers who arrived on the scene today."" Banks said authorities had no reports of any specific threats the gunman made to people at the company or anyone else. He said the attack shows why people need to alert authorities if they learn of anything that could lead to violence. ""If people see something that seems abnormal, they need to say something,"" Orlando Mayor Teresa Jacobs added. Fiamma Inc. calls itself one of the largest manufacturers of awnings for camper vans, motor coaches and sport utility vehicles. Gov. Rick Scott said he had been briefed by law enforcement and that he and his wife, Ann, were ""praying for the families who lost loved ones today."" © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

305,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting/ups-worker-kills-three-colleagues-in-san-francisco-turns-gun-on-himself-idUSKBN1952G3,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Emmett Berg 4 Min Read SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A UPS driver opened fire with a handgun inside a United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N delivery center in San Francisco on Wednesday, killing three co-workers before fatally shooting himself as police closed in, authorities and company officials said. Two people wounded by gunfire were taken to a hospital. Five other people suffered less serious injuries in a frantic exit from the building, San Francisco police said. The gunshot victims, like the killer, all were UPS drivers, and the attack unfolded as the workers gathered for their daily morning meeting before starting their delivery rounds, said Steve Gaut, head of investor relations at UPS. Authorities did not immediately identify the suspect or the victims. Assistant San Francisco Police Chief Toney Chaplin said the gunman shot himself in the head as he was confronted by officers swarming the building. The police never fired a shot. Authorities offered no possible motive for the violence and Chaplin said at a news conference it was not an act of terrorism. Police said they recovered two firearms, including the murder weapon, which they described as an assault pistol. The UPS facility, a package-sorting and delivery hub that serves the greater San Francisco area and employs about 350 workers in the city’s Potrero Hill area, was placed under a security lockdown for six hours. “We are always saddened by the loss of life to gun violence,” San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said on Twitter. “Any shooting is one shooting too many.” The UPS shooting erupted hours after an unrelated mass shooting at a baseball practice session in the Virginia suburbs of the nation’s capital left a congressman and several others wounded before the assailant was killed by police. Former congresswoman and gun-safety advocate Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt in Arizona that claimed six lives, issued a statement lamenting the shootings in Virginia and California, calling them “a stark indication of the scope of gun violence epidemic we face as Americans.” UPS is providing trauma and grief counseling to employees at the San Francisco center. Video footage from the scene showed a massive police presence near the facility, with workers being escorted outside and embracing one another on the sidewalk. One worker was found by police hiding inside the sprawling building after the shooting, unaware that the violence was over. “It was a frightful scene,” Chaplin said. The San Francisco bloodshed came three years after a UPS employee shot and killed two of his supervisors before turning the gun on himself at a UPS distribution center in Birmingham, Alabama. That gunman had recently been fired from the facility. The deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history occurred in June 2016 when a gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State militant group killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Gun laws in the United States rank among the most permissive of any developed country, with the right to “keep and bear arms” enshrined in the Constitution’s Second Amendment. Efforts to tighten national gun control measures failed after mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and the nightclub shooting in Orlando.

306,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/muslims-absolutely-group-victimized-global-terrorism-researchers/story?id=48131273,"Monday's terrorist attack targeting Muslims in London is just one of many. Witnesses describe horror at scene of London mosque attack — -- This week's terrorist attack targeting people leaving a London mosque after Ramadan prayers is part of a wider phenomenon, in which Muslims are the most affected by terrorism around the world, researchers told ABC News. While attacks by Muslims against non-Muslims in Europe have dominated headlines recently, researchers from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a research and education center at the University of Maryland, believe that Muslims are in fact the most likely victims of terrorism worldwide. START Executive Director William Braniff and his team studied the causes and human consequences of terrorism, compiling details about attacks like the one that took place in London on Monday. What they found is that — although they did not always have information about the religious beliefs of the victims — Muslims were the most affected overall. ""In the Middle East, Muslims are the most likely victims of both terrorism and counterterrorism efforts,"" Braniff told ABC News. His point of view may come as a surprise to Westerners who think about terrorism only as high-profile attacks carried out in the U.S. and Europe, such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year. But when he and his team looked at terrorism more comprehensively, including regions like the Middle East and Africa, it became clear that Muslims are most frequently targeted, he said. On May 30, for example, ISIS killed 31 people in Iraq in dual bombings. One attack used a car bomb, and the other targeted a popular ice cream shop in central Baghdad, according to The Associated Press. But those bombings drew significantly less attention from Western media than the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that took place May 22. In the Manchester attack, Salman Ramadan Abedi killed more than 20 people and left dozens of others injured, according to authorities. But Braniff stressed that Muslims face threats from terrorism outside the Middle East as well. He said that START researchers found an increase over the past several years in terrorism-related violence against Muslims in the 35 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organization that includes the U.S. and much of Europe. ""Here, we've seen an increase in attacks perpetrated by Islamic extremists but also terrorist attacks targeted against Muslims,"" he said. Erin Miller, the program manager of START's Global Terrorism Database, which tracks attacks going back to 1970, agreed that attacks against Muslims are on the rise and offered some insight into why they don't always garner the same media attention. ""There are many attacks against Muslims in the West, but they are frequently less lethal,"" she told ABC News. Miller cited a report by a German media group that said there were 3,533 attacks on refugees and refugee hostels in Germany in 2016. Those attacks injured 560 people, including 43 children, according to the report, but did not result in any fatalities. Monday's attack in London, outside the Finsbury Park Mosque, injured at least 10 people, and one person died, but it is unclear if his death was a direct result of the attack. Miller said that it is frequently difficult to determine the difference between what is referred to as a hate crime in the U.S. and terrorism directed against Muslims, although that distinction isn't the most important one to make when determining what groups are most often targeted by violence. ""The distinction between whether something is terrorism or a hate crime is often not very useful in this discussion,"" she said. ""It's an artificial distinction."" The FBI defines a terrorist act as ""a violent act or an act dangerous to human life, in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any state, to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives."" The bureau defines a hate crime as ""a traditional offense like murder, arson or vandalism, with an added element of bias."" Muslims are threatened by both terrorism and hate crimes in the West, according to Miller. President Trump has frequently been criticized by human rights groups for not speaking out against the white supremacist contingent of his base more vociferously and for failing to respond promptly to violence that affects Muslims, rather than violence that is perpetrated by them. ""It's like pulling teeth to get President Trump to respond to terror attacks on Muslims,"" Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement. Hooper criticized Trump's response to the mosque attack in London and to the killing of 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen in Virginia. She was attacked near the mosque she attended, in what appears to be a road-rage-related episode, according to police. ""His silence or his delay really sends a negative message to the American Muslim community that their lives and their safety are not as important as the lives and safety of other citizens,"" Hooper added. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the president's response to Monday's terrorist attack in London or attacks on Muslims in general. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in an off-camera press briefing on Monday that the administration's ""thoughts and prayers"" were with the victims of the mosque attack in London and that Trump was receiving updates about it. The president's Twitter account, which he frequently uses to denounce terrorist attacks perpetrated by Muslims, has been silent on the matter. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-06-21 04:48:39,"Muslims 'absolutely' the group most victimized by global terrorism, researchers say","religion and churches,islam,terrorism,crime and criminals,airlines and airplanes,world trade center (nyc),office buildings and commercial properties,hijacking",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Saul Leob/AFP/Getty Lawmakers, Hill staffers and police officers at the U.S. Capitol were in shock Wednesday in the aftermath of the early-morning shooting at congressional Republicans’ baseball practice. The attack left Steve Scalise, the number-three House Republican, and four others wounded and recovering in local hospitals. Many of the Congress members who had to hit the dirt to avoid being caught in the crossfire, kept their baseball jerseys and cleats on as they hopped from one cable interview to another at the Capitol, recounting how they survived, avoiding the bullets that hit the dirt around them. “This is a horrible aberration, and it makes us fear for our security,” says a visibly shaken Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, who has cuts and scrapes on his arms and knees from hitting the dugout floor to avoid the bullets. While he talks to reporters, he’s still in a dirt-covered jersey emblazoned with the word “Republican.” The morning’s tragedy is just beginning to dawn on him. “Just a horrible … experience. And actually, now thinking [about] the magnitude of the shots that were fired and the carnage that was there, I’m still in a state of shock.” Related

						'Silence of the Lambs': The Complete Buffalo Bill Story Fleischmann represents Chattanooga, Tennessee, which witnessed a targeted mass shooting in 2015 when Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez drove to two separate Marine centers and opened fire, killing four. In the aftermath of that shooting, just as in the aftermath of Wednesday’s attack, Democrats called for stricter gun-control measures, but Fleischmann and most others in the GOP have resisted. “It’s about the person. We have people in this country, sadly, who have just a horrific value system – somebody like this, today, who would do that, people who engage in terrorism. They will unfortunately find their weapon of choice,” Fleischmann tells Rolling Stone. “What we need to do is focus on keeping Americans safe. But I am, and will always be, a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. Put it this way: If we had had more weapons there, we’d be able to subdue the shooter more quickly. Thank God that the Capitol Police were there and were armed, because otherwise we’d have had a situation where there’d be a lot more damage.” After the shooting, House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled Wednesday’s scheduled votes, and the chaplain led a prayer for the victims on the House floor. Party leaders also canceled other proceedings, like a hearing in a House Natural Resources subcommittee on a piece of legislation that would ease restrictions on buying silencers for guns. Currently, getting a silencer requires purchasers to submit to being fingerprinted and produce a photograph that’s kept on file, and the waiting period can last as long as nine months. The bill being proposed by Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan would do away with those restrictions. The congressional baseball game – a century-long tradition to benefit charity – and the team practices are sacred to many lawmakers who say it brings the two parties together like nothing else in Washington. “It’s one of the things that makes you feel more normal – the camaraderie that we have in the mornings,” Republican Rep. Pat Meehan, who wasn’t at practice Wednesday morning, says to a group of reporters before being overwhelmed with emotion and tearing up. “The camaraderie that we have in the mornings when we are there is such a change from the pressures that we all feel on a regular basis, and is kind of a return to the fun things. You know, Scalise is the Whip, but when we’re out there we kind of treat each other like we’re in high school again.”   Duncan left the baseball practice just minutes before the gunman pulled out his rifle. “I’m shaken up,” Duncan tells reporters. A man whom Duncan later identified as the shooter had come up to the Congressman in the baseball field parking lot and asked if the players were Democrats or Republicans. “My colleagues were targeted today by somebody that wanted to kill them.” Duncan is avoiding questions on his bill for now, but he says he expects the legislation to become more politicized in the wake of the shooting. “It always turns into that,” he says. Other Republicans are avoiding specifics too. Rep. Rodney Davis, who represents the shooter’s home state of Illinois, was up to bat when the shooting began. “I heard a loud noise and thought it was a construction site dropping a large piece of metal, and then the next thing I heard was, ‘Run – he’s got a gun!” he says, still in his cleats and uniform. Davis gets heated mad when I ask whether there could have been greater carnage if the shooter had employed a silencer during his rampage. “Come on, I’m not going to deal with policy issues right now,” Davis says. “We can discuss policy and policy differences all we want, but the bottom line, America saw a tragedy today that could have been much worse without the heroic behavior of the Capitol Police. And for your first question to be about policy, that’s crap.” But some Democrats are eager to start the policy discussion. In the last Congress, they held a sit-in on the House floor after 49 members and allies of the LGBT community were gunned down at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub – a shooting that occurred a year ago this week. But after Democrats lost the White House in November, the issue has largely fallen off the radar. Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney, an outspoken gun-control advocate, says this is largely due to her party playing defense against President Trump’s agenda. “We’ve been pretty busy in trying to save health care and trying to save the consumers, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other things,” Maloney tells Rolling Stone. “We have resisted, insisted and persisted every single day. And it has been a fight every single day. This is a different kind of fight. And it may reorganize the focus”  on gun-control efforts.  But getting the GOP to rethink gun measures historically has been tough. Maloney says Democrats are going to keep the issue in play and that they are working on grassroots efforts to make gun control a key part of the 2018 election. Still, she’s hopeful Wednesday’s tragedy will lead to some softening of hearts and minds on the other side of the aisle. “I keep thinking – when Sandy Hook happened, I thought that would change the conversation. When our colleague Gabby Giffords was shot, I thought that would. I would think that this would change the conversation too,” Maloney says. “Democrats for gun safety were not opposed to people having guns that are licensed, and are for hunters and reasonable people. But we need background checks.” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe echoed that sentiment in remarks Wednesday afternoon. “Let me say this: I think we need to do more to protect all of our citizens. I have long advocated – and this is not what today is about – but there are too many guns on the street,” he said. In This Article:

309,http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/muslims-in-georgia-sixth-worry-about-baiting-by-republicans,"Ads criticizing Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff over terrorism have some Muslims in Georgia’s 6th District concerned they are being used as a rallying point for Republicans. The National Republican Congressional Committee recently released an ad that says the Islamic State terrorist group is “infiltrating America and using Syrians to do it” and criticizes Democrats for allowing refugees into the United States. The ad then blasts Ossoff for supporting the Iran deal, before flashing an image of the perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting attack, who were neither Iranian, Syrian nor refugees. Similarly, a pro-Donald Trump group called America First Policies released an ad last week that showed images of recent terrorist attacks in Europe and the U.S. and criticized Ossoff for embellishing national security credentials as a congressional staffer. Ossoff faces former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, a Republican, in the June 20 special election runoff to replace former GOP Rep. Tom Price, now the Health and Human Services secretary. Most polls have shown a close race, with Ossoff holding a slight lead. This isn’t the first time Republicans have hit Democrats for being weak on terrorism. Perhaps the most infamous incident also happened in Georgia in 2002 when Republican Saxby Chambliss ran an ad during his successful Senate campaign against Democratic incumbent Max Cleland, a war hero, that featured images of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Cleland lost his legs and his right forearm serving in the Vietnam War. Last year, Trump made refugees a major issue in the presidential campaign, calling for a total ban on Muslims entering the United States after the San Bernardino attack. And the issue of refugees and terror featured in many congressional races across the country. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to House GOP leadership, put out an ad criticizing Ossoff for working with Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based state-funded network, which featured an image of bin Laden. “I think it’s insulting to Muslim communities and it’s another stock partisan attack that they bring out every year,” Ossoff spokeswoman Sacha Haworth said. Ruwa Romman, communications director for the Georgia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, was disturbed by the ad by the NRCC, the House GOP campaign arm. “A GOP committee doing it seems a little more direct and more disingenuous,” Romman said. “I am seeing people saying Ossoff is sympathetic to terrorists.” Asked about the ad, Handel’s campaign referred to the NRCC. Maddie Anderson, an NRCC spokeswoman, said the ad was relevant to show a contrast between the two candidates. “The NRCC’s primary goal in this race is to show Georgians who will best keep them safe,” she said. “This is especially relevant when one person in the race lied about their national security credentials.” Republicans have accused Ossoff of exaggerating the nature of his security credentials when he worked as a congressional staffer for Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson. Romman also expressed disappointment that Handel has not reached out to the district’s Muslim community while Ossoff has visited a mosque in Roswell. But Handel spokeswoman Kate Constantini said in an email that Handel was “proud that her message of getting things done is resonating with citizens all over the 6th district including with voters in the Muslim community.” Aisha Yaqoob, executive director of the Georgia Muslim Voter Project, said she was surprised how the larger, national topics were becoming localized. “I see that they are playing to the Trump base,” she said. But she added that such tactics would alienate some voters. “I don’t think people appreciate getting ads with terrorists in their mailbox,” Yaqoob said. Romman said it’s possible that this kind of rhetoric could have dangerous consequences and her organization released a report showing a 44 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2015, when the presidential campaign began. “Anti-Muslim bigotry happens and spikes during election seasons, because of things like this,” Romman said.",2017-06-12 05:01:42,Muslims in Georgia 6th Worry About Baiting by GOP,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,terrorism,political advertising",19854,http://www.rollcall.com

The “Rally For Peace” was held in Washington, DC, by Trump supporters and conservatives aiming to protest political violence and the media voices that incite it. The recent shooting at a congressional baseball practice in which five were wounded and Republican politician Steve Scalise was hospitalized was a topic of discussion at the event, as well as the riots caused by radical leftist antifa groups at conservative events across the country, including former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos’s event at Berkeley in February. The event was organized by conservative political activist Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich, independent author and InfoWars radio host. Cernovich challenged activists on the left to a public debate, offering up $1 million to charity in exchange for a live broadcasted debate between Cernovich and Sam Harris and Alex Jones and Keith Olbermann. Cernovich claimed that despite this offer, the leftist commentators refused to respond to the debate request: Cernovich speech https://t.co/J3XZTq21LI — Anna Khait (@Annakhait) June 25, 2017 Other “New Right” pro-Trump figures spoke at the rally, including Virginia politician Corey Stewart, who can be seen addressing the crowd in the video below: https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879015930977804288 While Gateway Pundit reporter Lucian Wintrich and Big League Politics contributor Cassandra Fairbanks listed a number of fake hate crimes committed over the past year in an attempt to paint Trump supporters and conservatives as racists. https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879021878999998464 The rally was not interrupted by antifa anarchists or far-left protesters, but a rival alt-right protest formed nearby. Conservative groups such as the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers were on hand to provide security as they do at many other events. https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879029291996131328 Former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone was set to speak at the event but reportedly could not appear due to security concerns. InfoWars host Alex Jones was unable to attend the event as he was spending the day with his family but did send a note of apology to Mike Cernovich which was read aloud by Jack Posobiec at the event.

The gunman, the late James Hodgkinson, is the second high-profile case of a left-wing partisan attacking an SPLC target; in August 2012, Floyd Lee Corkins attempted to “kill as many as possible” at the DC office of the Family Research Council, using the SPLC website’s “Hate Map” to pick the site for a mass shooting. The SPLC’s representative behaved like a campaign tracker Sunday, tweeting quotes from speakers and attendees as proof of right-wing bigotry. In one of three tweets covering the rally, the SPLC @hatewatch account incorrectly identified one attendee as a “speaker” and singled him out for saying left-wing activist billionaire George Soros should be put in a “gas chamber.” At the ""Rally Against Political Violence"" in DC, this speaker just said ""It's time to put George Soros in a gas chamber!"" pic.twitter.com/fusoudjdlK — Hatewatch (@Hatewatch) June 25, 2017 Reached for comment, Posobiec attacked “fake news” SPLC for its factual error and touted the event as a success: I did not hear his comments which were not made at my rally, and I disavow any and all hate speech from both the left and the right. He is not a speaker he was not on my speaking bill and did not speak at the rally. SPLC is fake news. I got a crowd of Trump supporters to sing “Give Peace a Chance” by John Lennon, and that’s a testament to our commitment to peace and our stand against violence and violent rhetoric. SPLC has refused to retract its attacks on Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) which accuse him of being a white supremacist, even after Hodgkinson shot Scalise in the hip during a practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event and put the House Majority Whip in critical condition. Other left-wing figures have mocked and attacked Scalise and Republicans in the aftermath of the shooting, and establishment reporters as a whole have moved on from the shocking assault — in contrast to the weeks spent forcing Republicans to answer for the 2011 shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (R-AZ) — whose attacker had no political motivation. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

312,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/27/north-carolina-wannabe-terrorist-sentenced-to-life-in-prison/,"REUTERS/Stringer. A North Carolina man was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday, being found guilty of attempting to initiate terror attacks in North Carolina and Virginia and start an ISIS branch in the U.S., according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Justin Nojan Sullivan, 21, was preparing to engage in mass shootings on behalf of ISIS before his arrest by the FBI June 19, 2015. Sullivan admitted that he was inspired to slaughter innocent people by infamous and now-dead ISIS-recruiter Junaid Hussain, the DOJ statement said. “Sullivan was actively planning the mass killing of innocent people with an attack designed to inflict maximum casualties and maximum pain in the name of ISIS, a sworn enemy of our nation,” U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rose said. “Sullivan’s allegiance to ISIS did not stop there. He also planned to film and send a video of his deadly attack to now-deceased Junaid Hussain, a prominent ISIS member based in Syria, and further expressed his wish to create a new branch of the so-called Islamic State in the United States.” Court documents say Sullivan was radicalized as early as 2014, seeking out videos of ISIS attacks and beheadings on the internet. Hussain later began corresponding with and attempting to recruit an undercover FBI employee to join him in a mass shooting. Sullivan told the undercover agent that he planned to buy an AR-15 rifle at a gun show, along with hollow-point ammunition. He then asked the agent to help him manufacture a homemade silencer for the weapon, which he would use to kill as many as 1,000 people at a concert near his home. The silencer was delivered to Sullivan’s home June 19, 2015 and was subsequently opened by his mother. Sullivan offered to pay the undercover agent to kill his parents in order to prevent them from interfering with his terror plot, but he was arrested instead.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Noor Sulman faces charges of aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice A year after gunman Omar Mateen opened fire in Orlando's Pulse nightclub, his widow, Noor Salman, is currently awaiting trail, accused of helping her husband carry out the massacre on June 12, 2016. Salman pleaded not guilty in April to federal charges including aiding and abetting, the Orlando Sentinel reported. In May, an appeals court ordered her to stay in jail until her trial starts next year. FBI agents arrested Salman last January in her California home where she had been living with her son. The trial is scheduled to begin in March 2018, with jury summonses to be sent out in September. She could face life in prison if convicted. PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING: 49 VICTIMS REMEMBERED ONE YEAR LATER Salman knew about her husband's plan before the attack and how he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State terror group, prosecutors said. She shopped with her husband the night before the attack when he bought five containers of ammunition, a source close to the investigation told Fox News. She also failed four lie detector tests, according to the source. More than 60 families of victims and survivors have joined a lawsuit against Salman and Mateen's former employer, G4s security firm, on the same claims as the federal case, according to the Orlando Sentinel. They allege both parties ignored warning signs that could have prevented the massacre from happening. AFTER PULSE ATTACK, GAY LATINO COMMUNITY SEEKS STRENGTH The lawsuit is seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for the families' victims, including medical and funeral expenses, loss of support, along with other possible payments. Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens of others just before 2 a.m., around closing time at the gay nightclub. He was killed in a shootout with police after a three-hour standoff. The city of Orlando remembered the victims in the shooting on Monday, marking one year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The day was named ""Orlando United Day"" -- a day of love and kindness. Fox News' Mike Arroyo, Malia Zimmerman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

INVESTIGATES TRUMP FOR POSSIBLE OBSTRUCTION, 
reports The Washington Post: “The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. “The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump’s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said.” And Trump tweets it's all ""phony,""

the Senate Judiciary Committee is launching a wide-ranging probe of James Comey’s firing as FBI director, as well as any attempts to influence FBI investigations under the Obama administration,

reports POLITICO’s Elana Schor: “The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a bipartisan package of new Russia sanctions that also lets Congress block President Donald Trump from easing or ending penalties against Moscow, the year's most significant GOP-imposed restriction on the White House. “The 97-2 vote on the Russia sanctions plan capped a week of talks that demonstrated cross-aisle collaboration that's become increasingly rare as Trump and the GOP push to repeal Obamacare without any Democratic votes. Senators merged the sanctions package with a bipartisan Iran sanctions bill that's on track for passage as soon as this week, complicating the politics of any future veto threat from the Trump administration.” Meanwhile, the Pentagon is deconflicting with the Russian military ahead of planned large-scale exercises in Eastern Europe this summer,

via The Washington Post: “Airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition have caused a ‘staggering’ loss of civilian life in recent months around the Islamic State’s Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, a United Nations investigative body said Wednesday. “A U.S.-backed ground force entered the city with the help of coalition air raids last week, three years after the area became a hub from which Islamic State leaders planned expansion throughout the region and attacks around the world. “Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said Wednesday that coalition airstrikes have deepened the suffering in the city held by extremist fighters.” ISIS militants are posing as civilians and shooting anyone who tries to escape Raqqa amid the intensifying airstrikes,
adds Reuters. Additionally, they’re attacking U.S. forces with drones, sometimes disrupting their ability to call in airstrikes,
writes The Washington Post. Meanwhile, urban warfare in the Middle East is taking a civilian toll, the International Committee of the Red Cross says,

reports The Washington Post: “Dozens of Islamic State militants wearing suicide vests penetrated Iraqi police lines in Mosul on Wednesday, officers said, setting fire to houses to obscure the area from U.S.-led airstrikes in a large-scale counterattack that sent terrified residents fleeing.” — U.S. TROOPS ARE IN A BESIEGED PHILIPPINE CITY, 
reports the NYT: “American troops are on the ground in the embattled southern Philippine city of Marawi, where the Philippine military is battling Islamic State-linked militants for control, a Philippine military spokesman said on Wednesday. “The spokesman, Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla, said that the American forces were not engaged in combat, but his statement was the first official confirmation of the American military presence in Marawi.” INDUSTRY INTEL — BOEING REORGANIZES DEFENSE UNIT,

new study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Hiring Our Heroes program, with unemployment among spouses around 16 percent. Among its findings: frequent moves and the remote location of many bases contribute to higher unemployment, and spouses with higher levels of education face the most difficulty finding work. Unemployment and underemployment among spouses can affect military recruitment and retention, the survey shows, as lack of employment opportunities influences service members' decisions to stay or leave the military. — LAWMAKERS PRESS TRUMP ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA: Eleven House members have written Trump, urging him to incorporate human rights promotion into the administration's approach to North Korea.

By all rights, this should be the climate change/Kathy Griffin/Scott Pelley/covfefe edition. Those are just the big stories that broke in the last 48 hours. The news cycle is just as insane as the news media covering it. Trump has ditched the Paris climate non-treaty (never approved by the Senate). Nearly talentless comedian Kathy Griffin has dropped from the D List so far that she’s nearly caught me in F+ celebrity land and even lefty CNN dropped her. (After Squatty Potty!) CBS cut anti-Trump anchor Scott Pelley from its evening news and sent him into 60 Minutes exile. And the media went nuts over another Trump tweet -- obsessing over a typo. And on a day of a huge victory for Trump by exiting the Paris Climate Accords, thrilling conservatives (even ones who opposed him), Alternet pretends Trump support is weakening. “Could Donald Trump's Base Finally Be Turning on the President?” it asked. Nope. But it shows how out of touch the alt-lefty media has become. Welcome to Resist America -- aptly name since many on the left are indeed resisting America. They want to pout, prance, march, scream, whine, and harass because they can’t come to terms with Trump’s victory. They’ve taken their guidance from Hillary who has blamed everyone but elves and dwarves for her loss. (Hillary: Return of the Queen is due out in paperback from Gondor Books one of these days. The elves and dwarves will finally get theirs.) On the “news” media side, the Resistance (cue the Hogan’s Heroes theme music) continues to separate itself from anything resembling journalism. Let’s take a look at Fusion. In the midst of a story about the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris non-treaty, the Fusion fanatics lost their way. Here’s an exact quote: “Either way, unfurl those protest banners again, because it could be yet another week of anger and resentment toward the country’s most bumbling, misguided presidency ever.” Ah, journalism, or whatever it is that Fusion does. Perhaps they should try professional bowling. At least they are politically motivated, that should make them self aware. Or not. In an article headlined, “Snakes and Money Are the Real Threats to Journalism,” Fusion showed its own disconnect from reality. The piece was all about the worst dangers to the news industry. “It’s not mean words that threaten journalism in America. It’s money,” wrote Hamilton Nolan. (Hamilton’s a nice neutral reporter who, “donated to Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.” Then he “donated to Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign.” He underlined what he meant -- “rich owners” are the danger. “We are entering an era in which, more than ever before, journalism is dependent on hoping that rich people are good and not bad.” This is the point where self awareness should kick in for Fusion staff, since they work for lefty billionaire Haim Saban, who ranks at #660 on Forbes World Billionaires List with a mere $3 billion in personal wealth. Hamilton could have quit while he was behind, but he kept on going, bemoaning media money like he didn’t grasp the danger of his own, openly biased outlet. “Any rich guy with ulterior motives can buy a newspaper, and any political hack can sit in the editor’s chair and call himself an editor.” Ahem… He closed by warning, “It’s not the body slams we need to worry about. It’s the fucking snakes.” In the post-Gawker, Fusion world, dirty words give you earthy, street cred or make you look like a moron. Your mileage may vary. It’s not just losers from Fusion F-bombing their way through the climate debate. It’s people like former Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton. He tweeted  “Go fuck yourself, you lying piece of shit,” at White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, after Priebus was pleased at Trump pulling from the climate pact. (Wheaton has gone from secondary actor on one show to tertiary on Big Bang Theory, btw.) Loudmouth filmmaker Michael Moore called it the equivalent of “USA to Earth: FUCK YOU.” Which takes us back to Haim’s Hacky Host, and first an amazing video:  The Craziest Video You Will See All Day (I Hope): I do a lot of mocking of Fusion, Jezebel, Deadspin, etc. -- the Haim Saban wacky web world. And deservedly so. Haim runs Univision, which is available to 99 percent of Hispanic households. So he has enormous influence. And yet he runs websites that look like they are published in a mental asylum. (But less intelligent.) Here’s just a 3:44 video and yet it’s chock full of propaganda. Imagine what Haim and his employees can do with a whole network. The video, which screams: “WHY ARE WE SO OBSESSED WITH BLAMING ALL MUSLIMS FOR TERROR ACTS?” is on Fusion TV. It asks, “how we’ve managed to turn Islam into a 1.6-billion member criminal enterprise.” Naturally, it goes on to blame conservatives. Specifically, actual quote: “a steady stream of far-right politicians spoonfeeding the world a tale about how Islam is out to destroy us.” The B-roll shows VP Pence, former Gov. Sarah Palin, etc. Notice, no blame befalls the Muslim terror groups of (Taking a long breath here): Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestine Liberation Front, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, al-Qa’ida and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Those are Islamic terror groups off the official State Department list. All of those groups were put on the list during Democrat President Bill Clinton. Lots more have been added since, including ISIL (We call it ISIS) and Boko Haram. Now take a look at a Wiki list of May terror attacks. Notice something? I’m no Wiki fan but the list is pretty instructive about numbers of radical Islamic attacks. Now, back to our stupid video. Upset that Hillary Clinton linked the Pulse Nightclub shooting to radical Islam (Hint: She was right), our moderator asks: “When was the last time a leader of the whites went on an apology tour after a mass shooting in the U.S.” I know it’s hard for Fusion staff to grasp this, but being white is not an ideology, Islam is. Our color is not optional, unless we are named Rachel Dolezal. Our beliefs -- such as killing non-believers or the eight countries that execute gays (all Muslim). Those are optional.  Yes, The Alt-Left Is This Crazy: Forget the pro-Muslim propaganda for a moment. Let’s talk pro-abortion propaganda -- The Handmaid’s Tale. This is a ridiculous attempt to depict a fictional theocracy called Gilead. In the post-apocalyptic world, women who can breed are forced to do so with powerful men who rape them and keep them as slaves. If you’re the nutters at Bustle, that sounds a lot like present day America. I’m not kidding. Here’s the headline: “7 Times 'The Handmaid's Tale' Got Almost Too Close To 2017.” No, it’s not talking about Saudi Arabia, it’s making comparisons to Trump’s America and mentions Trump four times. Here’s the beginning, actual quote one: “The Hollywood Reporter hailed it as ‘unintentionally relevant,’ USA Today a ‘wake-up call for women,’ and Rolling Stone a ‘chilling Trump-era series.’"" Actual quote two: “Five months later it is, of course, still fiction, but as the series continues to unfold, its real-life resonance has only intensified.” I could actual quote this entire story. It only gets more stupid. The seven times include: “It Mirrors The War On Reproductive Rights” and, the real laugher, “It Speaks To Conservative Women” (“whose ideals often hinder the freedoms of other women.” Yeah, like the 30 million women the left has butchered since Roe v. Wade.) Bustle goes on to give a laundry list of lefty causes from climate change to LGBTQ rights. It oddly refers to “non-consensual sex” and how the protagonist was “forced to have intercourse with her commander.” It seems Bustle might hate conservatives but it’s unwilling to call out rapists? THe article is instructive as a peak into alt-left attitudes -- sort of the psycho psyche. They have convinced themselves this is “what could happen should religious extremism and misogyny revert our liberal democracy into a patriarchal regime” and strangely think we’re almost there. This must explain the loons wearing vagina costumes. Time To Break The Staff Of Life: Bread has been ubiquitous in some form throughout modern human history. Rye, wheat, white, flat, pita, and more. Bread has been called the “staff of life” and figures prominently in everything from the Bible to prison. Because it’s essential. Until recently. Fad diets have gone to war with bread and the gluten-free movement has caught on, in part because of some legit allergies, and part because of hipsters -- and they ruin everything. (Extra column points if you’ve ever heard of Meade Skelton. I had not till this.) Now the alt-left is at war with the tasty, flaky substance we all enjoy. Alternet alerted me to this food fiasco in a story headlined, “We Know for Sure That Bread Is Unhealthy—for the Environment, at Least.” Forget gluten, the left wants to target eco-gluttons. Actual quote one: “But it turns out there’s another reason to steer clear of bread: it’s having a massive impact on the environment.” As part of the ongoing, alt-lefty, nanny-statism, (actual quote two) “Scientists in the United Kingdom have worked out the greenhouse gas emissions produced by making a standard loaf of bread, pinpointing the emissions hotspots in the process.” So the question is, why I am loafing around here? The answer is simple. The left wants to seriously play with what we eat. It doesn’t matter whether it’s pushing vegetarian or vegan eating styles, cutting out salt or sugar or getting us to eat our own poop. We need to take every anti-food jihad seriously. As for me, I will defend my tasty bread products when they pry them from my cold, sticky fingers.  The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

By DARREN SAMUELSOHN 06/14/2017 11:28 AM EDT Updated 06/14/2017 05:34 PM EDT President Donald Trump’s first domestic mega-moment has arrived, and his measured reaction to Wednesday’s shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, is being praised by all sides as they gauge his temperament in a time of crisis. Trump touched on all the key notes in the immediate hours after the shooting at a congressional GOP baseball practice that sent five people to the hospital, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. His first remarks: A statement saying he and Vice President Mike Pence were “deeply saddened by this tragedy” and a tweet calling Scalise a “true friend and patriot.” Then, just before noon, the president embraced the role of sympathizer in chief, delivering a four minute-plus speech in the White House Diplomatic Room revealing that Scalise and two Capitol Police officers were in stable condition and confirming that the alleged gunman had died following the incident. In other large-scale moments since arriving on the international stage, Trump sparked controversy by referring to hot-button policy points, attacking his critics and getting ahead of confirmed law enforcement reports. All that was gone in his nationally televised remarks. “We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,” Trump said near the end of his remarks. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” the president added.

Earlier this month, Trump sparked an international uproar when he touted his controversial travel ban following a terrorist attack in London and mischaracterized its mayor’s attempt to reassure the public in the aftermath. During the heat of the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton criticized Trump after the Republican declared a bomb had detonated in New York before the local authorities had made that announcement. Trump also drew criticism in June 2016 when he issued a seven-paragraph statement in response to the mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, criticizing President Barack Obama for not saying the words “radical Islam” after the shooting and urging him to “step down” because of the omission. A White House official said that while prepping for his remarks Wednesday, Trump was cognizant of the importance of his demeanor. “He wanted to hit the right tone. Moments like this give the president an opportunity to rise above politics and strike a certain chord that captures the sentiment of the nation, that’s unifying and that’s what he wanted to do.” Trump’s softer and more tactful approach earned him praise from an unlikely source: Democrats. “It looks like Trump and his team took this shooting seriously and acted accordingly. His statement was measured and respectful and hit all the right notes when he issued a call for unity,” said Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic spokesman who worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Added a former senior Obama White House aide: “I think he sufficiently played the part.” Republicans also applauded Trump for his immediate response. “I think he set the right tone and message,” said former George W. Bush White House spokesman Scott McClellan. “This is a time to set aside politics and for all of us to come together in support of those who were injured in this tragic shooting. The president has an important role at times like this to be the comforter in chief for the nation.” “Temperate, compassionate, and thoughtful — the president’s remarks met the test of the moment,” said Michael Steel, who served as a spokesman for former House Speaker John Boehner. Beyond the initial White House statement and tweet on Wednesday morning, Trump stayed out of the spotlight as local and federal law enforcement officials pieced together the shooting in Alexandria, Virginia. Law enforcement sources named the suspected shooter about four hours after the incident as James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois. Those reports identified him as a supporter of Bernie Sanders, and his apparent social media accounts included anti-Trump posts. Sanders, in a statement, said he was “sickened by this despicable act” and condemned the shooting by “someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign.” The White House canceled a speech Trump was to give at the Labor Department later Wednesday afternoon. According to the White House, Trump spoke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Scalise’s wife and chief of staff, and the Capitol Police chief. Pence spoke with Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Texas GOP Rep. Joe Barton, Arizona GOP Sen. Jeff Flake and a staff member who coaches the Republicans’ baseball team. While the president’s televised response Wednesday drew praise, amid the initial presidential silence several Trump surrogates started making charged public statements and even ascribing a motive to the shooting. The president’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., issued a one-word post on Twitter — “This” — in sharing a tweet by conservative commentator Harlan Hill, who wrote: “Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President.” The tweet was an apparent reference to a current Central Park production of “Julius Caesar” — who in the play is made to look like the president. Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway shared a post by a local South Carolina television reporter quoting South Carolina GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan, who said the shooter asked, “Is this a team of Republicans or Democrats practicing?” By KYLE CHENEY “#breakingnews.” Conway wrote. New York GOP Rep. Chris Collins placed blame on Democrats, saying in an interview with WBEN radio they need to “tone down” their rhetoric. “I can only hope that Democrats tone down the rhetoric,” Collins said. “The finger-pointing, the angst, the anger directed at Donald Trump and his supporters … some people react to those things.” Collins referenced a “die-in” protest that happened at his office several weeks ago regarding Obamacare. “Let’s hope we can disagree on a more polite, conversational basis and not do things like they did at my office a couple weeks ago. It’s gone too far,” Collins said. Several former Democratic White House aides in the hours after the shooting said they hoped Trump would avoid politics in responding to the first major domestic shooting incident of his administration. “The tone and the words coming out of the White House matter the most,” said the same former senior Obama White House official who later praised the president’s in-person remarks. “There may be a lot of breathless speculation in the press and an instinct to react strongly, but the sweet spot is typically one of respect, vigilance and considered thoughtfulness.” “In these moments, the public looks to the president to bring some rationality to what we all have difficulty rationalizing,” added a former Clinton White House aide. “It’s a time to be the healer in chief, not the tweeter in chief.” Tara Palmeri and Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.

320,https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/nra-guns-2012/320461/,"In the wake of the Newtown school shooting — and a year full of gun violence — it's worth remembering that the NRA's favorite laws are passing. The National Rifle Association has been able to maintain its reputation as a respectable organization by portraying itself as a defender of the right to own weapons as a crime deterrent — a means to a less violent society. That's the genius behind its little slogan ""guns don't kill people, people kill people."" But in the wake of the Newtown school shooting — and a year full of gun violence — it's worth remembering that the NRA has been unmistakably advocating for a more violent society, one in which there are more and more scenarios in which there are no consequences for killing people. And the NRA's favorite laws are passing. The NRA is winning. February 26: Trayvon Martin is shot to death, and his shooter is initially not arrested as he's covered by Florida's Stand Your Ground law. July 20: 12 people are killed in the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting, and 58 are injured. September 22: In Kalispell, Montana, Brice Harper shoots and kills Dan Fredenberg, who entered Harper's garage unarmed and had not started a violent confrontation. Harper was having an affair with Fredenberg's wife. October 9: Flathead County prosecutor Ed Corrigan refuses to indict Harper because Harper is protected by Montana's expanded castle doctrine law. The law allows you to kill people just to keep them from entering your house. The state has the burden to prove your use of force wasn't justified. October 20: Saturday Night Live accurately portrays the essence of President Obama and Mitt Romney's response to a debate question about whether they would do something to control gun violence. ""Nothing."" ""I would also do nothing."" December 11: The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals strikes down Illinois's ban on carrying concealed weapons in Moore v. Madigan. Illinois was the last state with such a ban. December 13: ""Concealed weapons could be allowed in 'gun-free zones' under bill headed to Michigan Gov. Snyder,"" Michigan Live reports. While the NRA wins court fights, laws allowing more guns in more public places continue to spread, often for reasons that defy logic. For example, take the reasoning offered by Alabama state Sen. Roger Bedford, a Democrat, when explaining to Bloomberg earlier this week why he introduced a bill that would allow people to keep their guns in their cars in the workplace parking lot. ""This provides safety and protection for workers who oftentimes travel 20 to 50 miles to their jobs,"" Bedford said. What does this mean? If there's a workplace shooting, people need to be able to have their guns in the parking lot to turn the place into a true shootout? Or does he just mean that maybe people need to be able to shoot to kill while driving down the highway on the way to work? The fear of the NRA is so engrained in American politics that the group doesn't actually have to be successful in punishing gun control advocates anymore. The Sunlight Foundation reports that the NRA's political arm earned just a 0.83 percent return on investment in its election spending. Of the $10,942,533 the NRA spent in the 2012 election, less than 1 percent of the races ended in the NRA's desired result. So, for example, only 6 candidates it opposed actually lost. (The NRA disputes this analysis, arguing that money spent backing a sure winner should not be considered a smarter investment than money spent on a close race. It's still powerful on the local level — Bloomberg explains it helped defeat Tennessee Republican state House caucus leader Debra Maggart, who opposed a guns-in-the-parking-lot law.) And here's more proof the NRA has won culturally: any time someone writes that maybe we shouldn't let normal people buy war machines, there is an obligatory disclaimer by the writer either noting a lifelong love of guns or admitting to be a yankee liberal sissy. Mother Jones's Adam Weinstein on Friday: ""As a 3rd-gen. gun collector, I say you can have 'em. Now. And go after every tinfoil hat Bircher NRA peckerwood w/a long-gun, too. Now."" Slate's Bazelon in October: ""Call me a wimp who’s afraid of guns..."" Here's mine: The most rabidly pro-gun control people I've ever met were infantrymen who served in Iraq. The gun people know they are winning. Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation, wrote in the South Carolina newspaper The Times and Democrat this week: Despite the fact that anti-gunners may want to play down the significance of these rulings, the fact is we end 2012 with firearms civil rights in the strongest position they have enjoyed in generations. We intend to improve on that in the year ahead. I hope he fails miserably. But it's not looking good for the not-even-that-silent rational majority. Correction: We have clarified the type of weapons that was reportedly used in the Newtown shooting. CNN reports they include a .223 Bushmaster assault rifle. CBS reports two other weapons were a Glock 9mm pistol and a Sig-Sauer pistol.

321,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/uproxx/features/~3/ciZYlTvtyUQ/,"I started writing this piece last week about an attack in Orlando that killed five just before the one-year anniversary of another Orlando mass shooting. As if that already wasn’t a damning enough comment on the frequency of mass killings in America, before I could even finish, other active shooter situations knocked it out of the news cycle, including at least three on the president’s birthday — the attack on Congressman Scalise in Virginia, a mass shooting at a UPS facility that killed three in San Francisco, and a shooting near Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn (there was another lockdown at Travis Air Force Base that turned out to be a false alarm). The news cycle barely has room for all of them. Just as an experiment, type in a Google News search for “London attack,” and then compare the results to what you get for “Orlando attack.” If it seems like there’s a lot more coverage of the van attack on London Bridge that killed seven last Saturday than the attack at the Fiamma factory in Orlando in which a disgruntled employee killed five former co-workers and then himself last Monday, you’re not imagining things. In fact, just look at our president’s Twitter feed. In the days since the London attack, he’s tweeted a report of the attack, a message of support to London, blamed the London attack on political correctness, attacked London’s mayor over his response, (twice), pointed out that the London attacker didn’t use guns, and restated his travel ban (at least five times), without once mentioning the Orlando shooting. Interesting, because this time last year, he was all over the other Orlando mass shooting, tweeting at least four times about the infamous Pulse Nightclub attack that killed 49 exactly 51 weeks before the Fiamma factory incident. The disconnect is easy to explain. While the Paris attack was a “terrorist” attack and the Fiamma factory just your run-of-the-mill disgruntled non-Muslim mass murderer, Pulse Nightclub straddled both lines, and thus rated a mention. The president gets very excited every time a killer shouts “Allahu Akhbar.” It should come as no surprise, but the threat of “random” terror vastly outweighs that of “Islamic” terror. In 2014, for every one American killed by terrorists at home or abroad, 1,049 were killed by gun violence. Sure, as the NRA folks will certainly rush to point out, that number includes suicides and accidents (what, those don’t count?). But if that stat’s not “random” enough for you, you’re still twice as likely to get shot by a toddler than a terrorist. Should we have a travel ban on babies? (Come to think of it, maybe that’s not a bad idea…) But I’m falling into the same old trap, trying to decide which flavor of murderer is the scariest. It’s like when movie studios get us arguing over which actor would make the best Spider-Man while they reboot it for the 17th time. These days, whenever there’s a mass shooting, we wait breathlessly for a motive and then whichever side “wins” (Islamic terrorist being a big win for the right, right-wing hate crime being a big win for Democrats) gets to spike the football on Twitter (that the Virginia shooter was apparently a Bernie Sanders supporter is rare win for both sides). I state the obvious here, but this is no way to live. Trump doesn’t mention random gun violence because he knows a certain subset of Americans automatically equate it with gun control. It’s hard to talk about, because even the qualifier — “gun” violence — is enough of a trigger word (har) that some people who just like guns and want to keep shooting them will immediately shut down. That’s why Trump was so thrilled that the London attacker killed people without guns. Finally, a killing even the NRA can be outraged about! Surely, the facts would suggest that gun owners’ fears are mostly irrational. Obama spent eight years in office, a few of them with a Democratic majority in both houses, without ever passing much in the way of substantive gun control — this despite the impetus of Sandy Hook, Fort Hood, Pulse, etc. And yet to this day, millions of Americans are still convinced that jack-booted thugs are going to break down our doors and steal our AR-15s any day now. But feelings don’t operate on facts. “Gun Control,” like terrorism, has become an existential threat. And while I’ll never understand the complete unwillingness to compromise (expanded background checks? not letting the mentally ill or people on terror watch lists or people with a history of domestic abuse buy guns?), if I try hard I can understand the general hostility towards gun control as an idea. For one thing, it’s a little disingenuous. For me and most of the people I know, both liberal and conservative, the ideal state would be “no gun control for me and a near total gun ban for everyone else.” We all simultaneously yearn for fewer guns around and have a vague sense that we probably need one. A lot of liberals became doomsday preppers overnight after Trump got elected. There’s also the principle of not wanting to have your personal liberty curtailed because of the worst among us. Which is to say, let’s not pretend that shooting guns isn’t fun, or that the idea of someone who’s never done anything wrong having to change their enjoyable hobby for people who have isn’t somewhat disappointing. You don’t necessarily deserve to be demonized for thinking that. Am I bending over backwards to find common ground here? Perhaps, but lobbyist groups’ MO is to try to convince us that there’s no common ground when there’s actually plenty. In this post-Roger Ailes social universe where everyone who doesn’t agree with you politically is a dangerous psychopath and a threat to your very existence, it behooves us to try to find those small patches of territory where an overwhelming majority of us just might agree. Because otherwise we’re never going to get anything done, and inaction is killing us. Admittedly, it hasn’t gone well so far. In the wake of past shootings, NRA mouthpiece Wayne LaPierre, when he wasn’t spouting bullshit about good guys with guns and more guns being the solution to all our gun problems, occasionally offered some not terrible ideas (regardless of whether he actually believed them). After Sandy Hook, he said the issue wasn’t guns but mental health (a common refrain), and suggested “an active national database for the mentally ill.” It was mental health again after the Navy Yard shooting, with LaPierre suggesting “They need to be committed is what they need to be, and if they’re committed, they’re not at the Navy Yard.” Over and over he’s said publicly that “We have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed.” Whatever your gun thoughts, it doesn’t seem like a huge stretch to agree that a person who commits mass murder (often suicidally) might have some mental health issues. Why not call LaPierre on his bluff? It’s an idea so logical that the Obama Administration tried to do just that, authorizing a new rule for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System that would’ve required the Social Security Administration to provide the names of those on disability for mental health issues (people who had been unable to manage their personal affairs) to prevent them from purchasing firearms. Basically, if the government deemed you mentally suspect enough to give you money, you wouldn’t get to buy guns. It would’ve affected an estimated 75,000 people, and accomplish almost exactly what LaPierre said he wanted following the Navy Yard shooting. “I’ve been into this whole (background) check business for 20-some years; I’ve said the system is broken for 20 years and nobody listens,” he said. “It’s broken in terms of our military bases…. On the gun check, the NRA supported the gun check because we thought the mental records would be in the (national instant check) system, we thought criminals would be in the system. And we thought they would be prosecuted.” Naturally, the rule was repealed before it could even go into effect, with help from the NRA (but also the ACLU). In February the Senate voted 57-43 to repeal it, with the Republicans joined by Democrats Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and independent Angus King of Maine. Painted as a victory for freedom by its backers, Senator Grassley and Mitch McConnell naturally had lots to say about the flaws of the rule and the “vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard” which might keep — gasp! — some people getting disability from buying guns. And nothing to say about how they might improve it. Okay, so that one’s a no-go. Uh… what about keeping people on the terror watch list from buying guns? Republicans hate terrorists! Even Donald Trump seemed to support that one: I will be meeting with the NRA, who has endorsed me, about not allowing people on the terrorist watch list, or the no fly list, to buy guns. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2016  Or at least, he said he was meeting with the NRA to discuss the possibility of it. It’s interesting that he’s not even embarrassed about having to clear a potential policy with an industry lobbying group. In fact he broadcasts it, because just the possibility that Trump might push back against a plainly self-interested billion dollar lobby was meant to express how much of a maverick he is compared to most of our politicians. Closing this so-called “terror gap” is an idea supported by 84% of Democrats and 75% of Republicans, according to a Gallup Poll from June of last year. And yet it died in congress about a year ago, halted by competing amendments. Since the election of Donald Trump and a commanding majority for Republicans in congress, it’s no longer enough of a legislative priority to even rate. Which is a shame, because arguing against it again forced Republicans into disingenuous agreements with the ACLU, over concerns about due process and the constitutionality of how people are put on the terror watch and no-fly lists in the first place. It seems the only time you can get both sides to agree is in a do-nothing coalition over gun control. It’s hard not to get discouraged at this point in the story, when it seems we’re not even allowed to talk about gun control. It seems increasingly like a non-starter, and seems likely to remain so even after a Republican congressman was himself the victim of a spree shooter. Republicans are actually calling for looser gun laws following the Scalise shooting, not tighter ones. So we’re not allowed to talk about gun control. We can’t keep guns from the mentally ill, domestic abusers, or potential terrorists. What about mental health itself? Might we talk about deinstitutionalization, which began in the sixties? (Roughly during the same time and place where a third of all the world’s mass shootings have taken place, but maybe we don’t mention that part to the NRA). San Francisco is a good case study here, as it’s a city widely perceived to have some of the strictest gun laws in the country. Details are still sketchy about the UPS worker who killed three co-workers and then himself at a UPS facility (using a 1911 style handgun and a Tec-9), but police sources have told local news that the man had “a history of mental health issues.” It’s an especially relevant factor in San Francisco, home to one of the worst homelessness problems in the country, where signs of mental illness are all around. According to a 2015 study, 55% of those homeless were experiencing mental or psychiatric issues. While it’s harder to put numbers on the percentage of violent acts committed by those with mental illness, a study from the 80s found that 10% of all homicides were committed by those with mental illness. Whether your solution is a lower, nationally uniform standard for involuntary commitment, or simply better-funded services, the problem is clear. During JFK’s presidency, he tried to improve the standard of care at frequently horrifying, One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest-style mental facilities. Only his plan was never fully funded. Reagan gutted the mental health budget even further, both as governor of California and as president. In the aftermath of the 2008 recession, states cut at least $4.35 billion in mental health spending, the biggest cut since deinstitutionalization began. In 2010, there were 14 beds for 100,000 people, the same ratio as in 1850. There are currently three times as many mentally ill people in jails and prisons than there is space for them in hospitals. At a time when Congress is trying to take away healthcare access to 23 million people, it’s an open question whether they’d be any more successful in improving mental health services as they were in enacting meaningful gun control. It’d be nice if one of them actually getting shot inspired them to move more quickly, but this isn’t the first time. Gabby Giffords’ shooter, Jared Loughner, was an undiagnosed schizophrenic who had a history of disruptions during which police or security were called, and it seems he basically had to kill six people before he was put in a mental health facility. And yet if you search “Jared Loughner,” most of the articles about him are about whether he was a Democrat or Republican. You’d think that would’ve been a great time to address the mental health problem everyone said there was, but it wasn’t. Which wasn’t even a particular surprise. After all, one of the chief mental health care funding slashers, Ronald Reagan, was nearly assassinated himself by an untreated schizophrenic named John Hinckley two months into his presidency and it apparently did nothing to alter his policies. If anything is clear after all of this, it’s that America can either have widely available guns or poor mental health funding. Trying to have both is killing us.",2017-06-16 12:30:00,"If We Can’t Have Gun Control In America, Can We At Least Have Adequate Mental Health Services?","medicine and health,murders and attempted murders",68816,http://www.uproxx.com/#spider

323,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/mucxst1pjew/2016-was-the-deadliest-year-ever-for-lgbt-americans,"SEARCH Setting aside the 49 victims of the Pulse massacre, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs still tracked a 17 percent increase in anti-LGBT homicides from 2015 to 2016. 2016 was the deadliest year on record for the LGBT community, according to a new report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. And even setting aside the 49 victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre last June, the NCAVP still tracked a 17 percent increase in anti-LGBT homicides from 2015 to 2016. “The enormous tragedy at Pulse Nightclub, in concert with the daily violence and discrimination that pervades our lives as LGBTQ people, and an incendiary political climate, have created a perfect storm of fear and trauma for our communities this year,” said Melissa Brown at the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project in a press release accompanying the report, released Monday on the one-year anniversary of the Orlando mass shooting. Between the largely Latino victims of the Pulse shooting and the transgender women of color who were murdered last year, the NCAVP report shows that LGBT people of color continue to bear the brunt of homophobic and transphobic violence in the United States. “We must work to dismantle the biases, such as transphobia, biphobia, homophobia and racism, which undergird all of this violence,” Brown added. Including the victims of the Pulse shooting, the NCAVP counted 77 anti-LGBT homicides in 2016. But because the sexual and gender identities of many of the Pulse victims could not be confirmed, the anti-violence organization also tallied 28 individual anti-LGBT homicides throughout the year, up from 24 in 2015. This latter group of victims were largely transgender, 64 percent black, and over half were younger than 35. “In general, I can say that in the past five to seven years, homicide rates have been high or up and appear to be staying up,” Sue Yacka, communications director for the New York City Anti-Violence Project, told The Daily Beast when asked how this homicide data compared to previous years. “There are many reasons for this, including a likely actual increase, better reporting by media, and better data collection by organizations like ours.” The stories of the victims, included in brief at the end of the report, are heartbreaking: Maurice Jones, a 44-year-old black cisgender man living in Queens, was “strangled to death” last September and “left in a burning car.” Thirty-two-year old transgender woman Brandi Bledsoe was fatally shot in her Cleveland, Ohio, driveway last October. Erykah Tijerina, a Latina transgender woman, was fatally stabbed in her El Paso apartment in August. Many of these victims were misgendered by local media after their deaths, making it difficult for advocates to track the violent killings of transgender and gender non-conforming people. The NCAVP also tracked over 1,000 reported incidents of non-fatal anti-LGBT hate violence—such as sexual violence, physical violence, stalking, bullying, and verbal harassment—through partner organizations nationwide. Most of this violence, the report notes, came from “someone who was known to [the survivor]” including “landlords, neighbors, employers, and family members.” Over 40 percent of this group of survivors identified as gay and over 40 percent were cisgender. Anti-LGBT violence shows no signs of stopping in 2017. In the first 60 days of the new year, as The Daily Beast previously reported, there were already seven reported killings of transgender women, placing the year on track to be the most violent on record for the U.S. transgender community. Now in June, the Human Rights Campaign has tracked at least 12 reported killings of transgender people this year. But even as this reported physical violence escalates, LGBT people remain in a precarious political position both federally, and at the state level. LGBT anti-violence advocates see these two trends as linked. “Recent executive orders as well as ongoing efforts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation and roll back protections at the city, state, and federal level make LGBTQ people vulnerable to identity-based discrimination as we go about our daily lives,” said Beverly Tillery at the New York City Anti-Violence Project. The NCAVP report paints a clear increase in anti-LGBT bills over the last three years: 125 introduced in 32 state legislatures in 2015, 156 introduced in 32 states in 2016, and 100 in 29 states in 2017 so far. Most memorably in 2016, North Carolina passed the anti-transgender “bathroom bill” HB2—a move the Texas state legislature may imitate during a special session this summer. Rather than continuing the Obama administration’s moves to protect transgender Americans, the Trump administration has withdrawn legal defenses of transgender rights, rescinded federal guidance protecting transgender students’ restroom rights, and effectively sent transgender teenager Gavin Grimm’s potentially precedent-setting case back down to the 4th Circuit from the Supreme Court. All the while, only 16 states and D.C. have hate crime legislation that specifically protects people based on sexual orientation and gender identity, according to data from the Human Rights Campaign. For those reasons, Tillery believes that the best way to mitigate anti-LGBT violence going forward might be to stop the LGBT laws in state legislatures nationwide. “These attacks on our communities send the message that discrimination and violence against LGBTQ people is acceptable,” she said. “Every one of us must call out and resist religious exemption and anti-LGBTQ public accommodation bills for the hateful legislation that they are, and advocate for increased protections for LGBTQ communities on the state and federal level.”",2017-06-12 00:00:00,2016 Was the Deadliest Year Ever for LGBT Americans,"discrimination,murders and attempted murders",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
324,http://theweek.com/articles/705655/please-dont-politicize-awful-congressional-shooting,"BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images The shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) — who as majority whip is the third ranking Republican in the House — is a crime, a tragedy, and may very well have been a politically motivated act. But it is also an opportunity for the media, citizenry, and governing class to do something that goes against the normalized practices of modern discourse: Be prudent, calm, and decent in a time of high anxiety. Details are sketchy and will continue to unfold, but the attempted massacre at a practice of the Republican congressional baseball team in Alexandria, Virginia, has left at least five people wounded, including Scalise. Everyone survived except the shooter. In a phone interview with MSNBC, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he heard ""50 or 60 shots"" over the course of several minutes, and that the shooter's weapon ""sounded like an AR-15 to most of us."" Paul also noted that the only reason there was a Capitol Hill Police detail at the baseball field was because a member of congressional leadership was present. Without Scalise in attendance, Paul says, there would have been no law enforcement security presence on the scene, drastically increasing the likelihood of greater casualties. ""It would have been a massacre,"" the senator said. Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) told Fox News that as he was leaving the practice early, a man approached him ""asking whether there was Republicans or Democrats out there."" Minutes later, the shooting began. Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) said the gunman was there to ""kill as many Republican members as possible."" And when the shooter was identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old Illinois man who supported Bernie Sanders and has been highly critical of President Trump on social media, internet-dwelling partisans had more than enough tinder to spark an inferno of hot takes. AR-15s have been described as mass shooters' ""weapon of choice"" by numerous high-profile media outlets, and should it become known that the Alexandria shooter indeed tried to mow down elected Republican representatives of the federal government at an early morning baseball practice with such a weapon, the story could easily become a gun control and/or Second Amendment story, with the shooters and victims mere pawns in a predetermined political morality play. Was the man who DeSantis spoke to indeed the shooter? We don't know yet, but either way, the narrative has been laid that this person possessed a rational political motivation beyond whatever psychoses led him to set out to commit mass murder. Unfortunately, politics so often becomes an exercise in tribalism rather than policy and governance, and because the victims of this crime are Republicans (and police officers), some in the GOP tribe will set out to lay blame on cultural forces of ""the left"" for fostering an atmosphere of such hostility that political violence is the only logical outcome. (The president's son did just that in a tweet this morning.) This instinct should be rejected, just as it should have been — but wasn't — in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Az.) grievously wounded and six others dead. Before anything about the shooter was known, commentators and partisans were blaming everything from the Tea Party to conservative talk radio to a little-seen Sarah Palin political action committee ad for the massacre. To this day, the Tucson shooting is probably best remembered as symptomatic evidence of American political toxicity, even though the shooter — Jared Loughner — turned out to be a long-troubled and severely mentally ill young man with almost indiscernible politics and an obsession with lucid dreaming and conspiracy theories. It's still early, but there should be no doubt that Wednesday's sick crime will be exploited by partisans on the right to prove their own preconceived narrative that widespread hostility from ""cultural elites"" to President Donald Trump fostered an environment that led a man to attempt to assassinate a number of members of the president's political party. For all its usefulness as a newsgathering tool, in troubled moments such as today Twitter becomes a place for craven jerks to feed the maw of partisan outrage: Kathy Griffin, Snoop Dogg, & MSM glorified the assassination of our President.Now GOP Congressman Steve Scalise has been shot as a result. In the spirit of living by my own advice, I don't know why the shooter did what he did, though I find it highly unlikely that the ham-fisted attempt at satire by Kathy Griffin or a Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar that almost no one has seen motivated a man to commit such a despicable atrocity. That said, I do know what motivates someone to blare such baseless speculation mere minutes after the shooting stops: When you are only capable of seeing humanity in your own tribe, you can only see inhumanity in another tribe. This was true after the Tucson shooting, when right-thinking liberals needed to believe the anti-tax rhetoric of the Tea Party caused a bloody rampage, but it doesn't need to be true today. Take a deep breath, think of the victims and their families, and resist the opportunity to score cheap points in the game of social media memes. Just for today, at least.

University of Massachusetts provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list The attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a man named James Alex Fields Jr. used his Dodge Challenger as a weapon against a crowd of protesters, underscores the growing violence of America’s far-right wing. According to reports, Fields was a active member of an online far-right community. Like many other far-right activists, he believes that he represents a wider ideological community, even though he acted alone. My 15 years experience of studying violent extremism in Western societies has taught me that dealing effectively with far-right violence requires treating its manifestations as domestic terrorism. In the wake of the Charlottesville attack, the Department of Justice announced it would launch a federal investigation: “…that kind of violence, committed for seeming political ends, is the very definition of domestic terrorism.” This acknowledgment may signal that a growing domestic menace may finally get the attention it deserves. While attacks by outsider Jihadist groups will probably continue, domestic terrorism still deserves more attention than it’s getting. Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare. Most terrorist groups lack the resources, expertise and manpower to defeat state actors. Instead, they promote their agenda through violence that shapes perceptions of political and social issues. Fields’ attack, if it was motivated by racist sentiments, should be treated as an act of domestic terrorism. Here I define domestic terrorism as the use of violence in a political and social context that aims to send a message to a broader target audience. Like lynching, cross-burning and vandalizing religious sites, incidents of this kind deliberately aim to terrorize people of color and non-Christians. I consider domestic terrorism a more significant threat than the foreign-masterminded variety, in part because the number of domestic terror attacks on U.S. soil is greater. For example, my report published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point identified hundreds of domestic terror incidents taking place between 2008 and 2012. Another report, published in 2014 by New America Foundation on domestic incidents of extremist violence, shows that excluding the Orlando nightclub massacre, between 2002-2016, far-right affiliated perpetrators conducted 18 attacks that killed 48 people in the United States. Meanwhile, terrorists motivated by al-Qaida’s or the Islamic State’s ideology killed 45 people in nine attacks. The Orlando mass shooting, given its mix of apparent motives, is difficult to categorize. In briefings with law enforcement and policymakers, I have sometimes encountered a tendency to see U.S. right-wing extremists as a monolith. But traditional Ku Klux Klan chapters operate differently than skinhead groups, as do anti-government “patriot” and militia groups and anti-abortion extremists. Christian Identity groups, which believe Anglo-Saxons and other people of Northern European descent are a chosen people, are distinct too. Certainly, there is some overlap. But these groups also differ significantly in terms of their recruitment styles, ideologies and whether and how they use violence. Across the board, undermining the threat they pose requires a more sophisticated approach than investigating their criminal acts as suspected hate crimes. In an ongoing study I’m conducting at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with several students, we have determined that, as it seems to be also in the case of Fields, many attacks inspired by racist or xenophobic sentiments are spontaneous. That is, no one plans them in advance or targets the victim ahead of time. Instead, chance encounters that enrage the perpetrators trigger these incidents. Sporadic attacks with high numbers of casualties that are plotted in advance, such as Dylann Roof’s murder of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina church, are always big news. More typical incidents of far-right violence tend to draw less attention. The fatal stabbing of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Rick Best aboard a train in Portland, Oregon on May 26 seems to be no exception. The alleged killer of these two white men, Jeremy Joseph Christian, attacked them with a knife after they stood up to him for haranguing two young women who appeared to be Muslim, police said. A third injured passenger, Micahel  Fletcher, has survived. Much of the media coverage is focused on Christian’s violent and racist background. Given the spontaneous nature of so much far-right violence, U.S. counterterrorism policies should, in my view, target the dissemination of white supremacist ideology, rather than just identifying planned attacks and monitoring established white supremacy groups. The number of violent attacks on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology has spiked since the beginning of this century, rising from a yearly average of 70 attacks in the 1990s to a yearly average of more than 300 since 2001.  These incidents have grown even more common since President Donald Trump’s election. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that researches U.S. extremism, reported 900 bias-related incidents against minorities in the first 10 days after Trump’s election – compared to several dozen in a normal week – and found that many of the harassers invoked the then-president-elect’s name. Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that tracks anti-Semitism,  recorded an 86 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the first three months of 2017. Beyond the terror that victimized communities are experiencing, I would argue that this trend reflects a deeper social change in American society. The iceberg model of political extremism, initially developed by Ehud Shprinzak, an Israeli political scientist, can illuminate these dynamics. Murders and other violent attacks perpetrated by U.S. far-right extremists compose the visible tip of an iceberg. The rest of this iceberg is under water and out of sight. It includes hundreds of attacks every year that damage property and intimidate communities, such as the attempted burning in May of an African-American family’s garage in Schodack, New York. The garage was also defaced with racist graffiti. Data my team collected at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point show that the significant growth in far-right violence in recent years is happening at the base of the iceberg. While the main reasons for that are still not clear, it is important to remember that changes in societal norms are usually reflected in behavioral changes. Hence, it is more than reasonable to suspect that extremist individuals engage in such activities because they sense that their views are enjoying growing social legitimacy and acceptance, which is emboldening them to act on their bigotry. Despite an uptick in far-right violence and the Trump administration’s plan unveiled earlier this year to increase the Department of Homeland Security budget by 6.7 percent to US$44.1 billion in 2018, the White House also proposed to cut spending for programs that fight non-Muslim domestic terrorism. The federal government has also frozen $10 million in grants aimed at countering domestic violent extremism. This approach is bound to weaken the authorities’ power to monitor far-right groups, undercutting public safety. How many more innocent people like Heather Heyer, who was killed in Fields’ attack – and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Rick Best in Seattle – have to die before the U.S. government starts taking the threat posed by violent white supremacists more seriously?

326,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-city-pride-goes-political,"SEARCH After years of increasing mainstream acceptance of LGBT+ peoples, the election of President Donald Trump appears to have galvanized political action. Senior Photo Editor White House Reporter Two years to the day after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage across the nation, and roughly 48 years after the Stonewall Uprising gave birth to the modern movement for LGBT+ equality, more than one million people lined the streets of Manhattan to take part in New York’s Pride Parade. Tensions were visible between some factions of the marchers—some criticized Pride’s commercialization, others the presence of police among the parade’s marchers—with the election of President Donald Trump appearing to have galvanized the more political wing of LGBT+ community members. Although the proximity of first daughter Ivanka Trump to the Oval Office had been viewed with cautious optimism by some LGBT+ Americans, others see her complicity in the Trump administration’s actions regarding trans students in public schools as undercutting her personal views on LGBT+ rights. Some marchers chanted “Oh-lay, oh-lay oh-lay oh-lay / Fuck Trump… Fuck Trump,” while others focused on upcoming heath care legislation to be voted on in the Senate: “Hey Hey, Ho Ho / Trump’s new heath care got to go.” Members of the organization Gays Against Guns mourned members of LGBT+ communities who have been killed by firearms, particularly in hate crimes or the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, one year ago.",2017-06-25 20:47:14,New York City Pride Goes Political,"homosexuality,firearms,murders and attempted murders",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
327,http://ew.com/theater/2017/06/17/julius-caesar-trump-protesters-new-york/,"'Stop the normalization of political violence against the right,' one protester shouted. Friday night’s Shakespeare in the Park performance of a Trump-inspired take on Julius Caesar was halted when a protester stormed the stage at New York’s Delacorte Theater in Central Park, while another shouted from the audience. “Stop the normalization of political violence against the right. This is unacceptable,” 24-year-old Laura Loomer yelled as she took the stage during the show’s assassination scene. An announcer came over the intercom to pause the production and direct security to escort her off stage. “Shame! Shame on all of you,” she said as the audience booed her and guards led her out of the space. Jack Posobiec, the other protester, posted his own video of the incident to his Twitter page. “You are all Nazis,” he began shouting. “You are inciting terrorists.” Posobiec also referenced this week’s mass-shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, which left five people injured, including the House Majority Whip. “The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands,” Posobiec claimed. A rep for the NYPD confirmed to EW that Loomer was taken into custody at 9:45 p.m. ET and charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. After her release, she tweeted, “I’m out of jail, but I’m not apologetic.” The Public Theater, which put on the production, released a statement on the incident over Twitter: “Earlier this evening, a pair of paid protesters briefly disrupted our performance of JULIUS CAESAR, as anticipated. While we are champions of the first amendment, this interruption, unfortunately, was part of a paid strategy driven by social media. Thank you to our staff and security who worked to peacefully remove them from the theater so we could continue with our evening of Free Shakespeare in the Park.” The production’s director, Oskar Eustis, also released a statement. “We stopped the show for less than a minute and our stage manager handled it beautifully,” he said, in part, via The Daily Beast. “The staff removed the protesters peacefully, and the show resumed with the line ‘Liberty! Freedom!’ The audience rose to their feet to thank the actors, and we joyfully continued. Free speech for all, but let’s not stop the show.” Julius Caesar has been the subject of controversy among conservatives, given the resemblance of Gregg Henry’s Caesar to President Donald Trump. In the Shakespearian tragedy, Caesar is assassinated by members of the Roman Senate. So, here, it’s the Trump-like version that meets the same fate. (The character is, throughout, only referred to as Julius Caesar.) In the wake of the uproar, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines pulled sponsorship support from The Public Theater. “Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste,” a statement from Delta read. Eustis took the stage before an earlier showing this month to clarify, “Neither Shakespeare nor The Public Theater could possibly advocate violence as a solution to political problems — and certainly not assassinations. This play, on the contrary, warns about what happens when you try to preserve democracy by nondemocratic means, and again, spoiler alert, it doesn’t end up too good.” Following the small outburst by Loomer and Posobiec, numerous people criticized the protest via social media and mocked the outrage directed at Shakespeare’s centuries-old production. Loomer and Posobiec did receive support from numerous conservatives online, however, including controversial InfoWars host Alex Jones.",2017-06-17 09:16:39,"Trump-inspired Julius Caesar disrupted by protesters in New York

Marriage became legal. Caitlyn Jenner and others pushed open doors for transgender people. Oregon elected an openly bisexual governor — the nation’s first. Even the Boy Scouts dropped its ban on gay leaders. But with the election of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, and the appointment of several cabinet members whose agendas are perceived by some as anti-gay, many realized that those gains could be easily lost. “I’ll tell you one thing,” said Cathy Marino-Thomas, a former co-president of Marriage Equality USA, “it shook up those marriage advocates who thought they could go home.” So she, like many others, began pushing to turn the nation’s pride parades into old-fashioned protest marches in response to the potential unraveling of decades of political and social progress. The makeovers have brought tense confrontations between organizers who have spent months planning celebrations and those who think the political situation is so dire that the parades need to be recast. In the middle, and feeling left out, are the people who just want to show up and party, and the politically conservative who concede that although gay pride marches have always been somewhat political in nature, they have never been deliberately partisan. But bare-knuckle battles are nothing new when it comes to pride celebrations. “Many if not most of the L.G.B.T.Q. community know that queer street activism is as old and as predictable as the rainbow,” said Bob Witeck, a communications strategist and onetime congressional press secretary who works with the gay community and businesses like Marriott that market to it. “We create drama as much as confront it,” Mr. Witeck said. “But the questions raised about the purpose and meaning of pride itself are important ones.” Conflict has been baked into gay pride marches from the beginning. Even at the first march in Manhattan in 1970, organizers fought over whether it should be called a gay pride march or a gay power march. They even debated whether people who joined in the 51-block march from Greenwich Village to Central Park should be required to follow a dress code. That first march and rally (“a gay-in” in the parlance of the era) were staged on the first anniversary of the days of uprisings that followed a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Internal conflicts have become a hallmark of gay pride marches ever since. Organizers have grappled with criticism over the lack of attention to women, bisexuals, racial minorities and, more recently, transgender people. They have weathered fights over how to respond to the AIDS crisis and the fight for marriage equality, and weighed whether accepting lucrative corporate sponsorships was selling out. Last year, grief and heightened concerns about security in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., washed over many gay pride parades. But never have more parades been canceled or seen their focus shifted so dramatically. Citing the success of the Women’s March on Washington as inspiration, anti-Trump protesters gathered in more than 100 towns and cities on June 11, including in communities that traditionally hold pride parades later in the year or have never held them before. In Los Angeles, this year’s parade was abandoned in favor of a protest march that both criticized Mr. Trump and championed the importance of diversity. Tens of thousands of people marched, though not everyone was happy with the change. On social media and in interviews, critics said the event was less joyous and felt exclusionary. It was the second year in a row that Los Angeles organizers had grappled with pressure to change the parade. Last year, protesters staged a boycott of the parade, saying the event had lost focus and was in danger of becoming little more than a music festival for the young that some called a “gay Coachella.” In Washington, organizers decided to split the difference and hold the traditional Capital Pride Parade on Saturday, June 10, and the Equality March for Unity and Pride the next day. Protesters from a group that called itself No Justice No Pride disrupted Saturday’s parade, saying that the event had become too aligned with the police and corporate sponsors who had ties to Mr. Trump and projects like the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The march was less contentious, said Joe Mitchoff, a father of two who traveled from Portland, Ore., with a group of friends and attended both the protest march and the parade. “There was a celebration, and then a call to action,” he said, and both mattered. “I pay taxes, I have children,” he said. “To think my family is considered less than anyone else’s is absolutely unacceptable.” Robert Gonzalez, 47, and his husband, Craig Garmendia, 35, skipped the parade in favor of the march. Pride, they said, has become too commercialized. “This is more about letting people know we still haven’t made that more-perfect union,” said Mr. Garmendia, a Food and Drug Administration scientist who wore a rainbow bow tie for the march. Meghan Brown, 34, traveled from Virginia to attend the parade on Saturday and planned to attend the march the next day. She said she wished the two events had been merged, if only to make it more practical for people commuting into the city. “There’s not really a distinction,” she said of the events. On June 25 in both New York and San Francisco, organizers will blend the traditional parades with more-pointed political protests at events expected to draw record crowds. Heritage of Pride, the committee that organizes New York’s march, has agreed to reconfigure the order of the more than 300 contingents that march along Fifth Avenue, allowing groups pledging opposition to the Trump administration and the Republican leadership to have prominent positions near the front of the march. It was not an easy compromise. Early organizing meetings were heated, with groups like Gays Against Guns, Rise and Resist, and Act Up pressing the committee to include protest groups or face having tens of thousand of demonstrators show up anyway and possibly lead to disruption and arrests. “The idea that it’s a parade is against our history,” said Ms. Marino-Thomas, who is now a member of Gays Against Guns and was adamant that what organizers are calling resistance groups be included. “It began as a march. It was not meant to be this big corporate-sponsored parade.” Making room for so many protesters at the New York march was not a simple task for the city’s Pride celebration, which costs more than $1 million to stage and requires months of careful coordination with the city, the police and hundreds of groups and sponsors. Some of those sponsors contacted the organizing committee looking for guidance, said James Fallarino, a spokesman for NYC Pride. “It was more of a concern about how they could strike the right tone, not that they didn’t want to see resistance,” he said. “They wanted to make sure it was O.K. for them to be celebratory as well.” Sue Doster, who has been a pride organizer in New York and New Jersey for more than 20 years, initially worried about the logistics involved in adding a wave of anti-Trump protesters to the mix, but said the two sides were not really that far apart. Even the act of attending a gay pride parade or dancing in the street with a lover can be a form of protest when L.G.B.T.Q. people still don’t have full equality. “Pride in general was born out of protest,” Ms. Doster said. “I think they’re closer than they are portrayed. They are two sides of the same coin.” Advertisement",2017-06-19 05:00:29,Pride 2017: Gay Pride&#x2019;s Choice: March in Protest or Dance Worries Away,"politics and government,homosexuality",1,http://nytimes.com
329,http://www.salon.com/2017/06/15/megyn-kelly-nbcs-first-lady-of-normalizing/,"In March 1997 veteran journalist Peter Arnett journeyed for CNN deep into eastern Afghanistan to interview a man relatively unknown to most Americans. The subject’s name was Osama bin Laden. Arnett and his crew were not allowed to use their own cameras. The reporter had to submit questions to bin Laden in advance and was not allowed to ask any follow-ups. In archival video of the interview, bin Laden's calm, measured explanation as to why he had declared war on the United States sounded just shy of understandable. CNN even illustrated his observations about the West's double standard in regard to terrorism (“If [children] throw stones against the Israeli occupation, it says they are terrorists,” bin Laden pointed out) with footage of small, skinny boys running from uniformed men wielding automatic weapons. [salon_video id=""14782144""] But CNN countered bin Laden with interviews from United States intelligence officials, explaining his ties to terrorist attacks on American interests that claimed innocent lives. These too were accompanied by devastating imagery, this time of American people being pulled from smoking ruins, their faces contorted with fear and agony. In doing this interview, bin Laden sought to sell himself to the Western world as a man of purpose, determination and intelligence. The al-Qaida founder was well aware that CNN, ABC and every other major outlet who sought him were granting a broad, powerful platform to espouse his views. In the interview segment, he said as much to Arnett when the journalist asks about his future plans. “You'll see them and hear about them in the media, God willing,” bin Laden answered. Four and a half years later on Sept. 11, 2001, bin Laden made good on that statement. Journalism’s purpose is to shed a light. Megyn Kelly is absolutely correct in making that observation. But knowing she does so in defense of her interview of Infowars host Alex Jones that, as of this article’s publication, is still set to air on her NBC newsmagazine “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly” is troubling. It's too easy to dismiss Jones as a kook: All signs point to his being one, not to mention a hateful person. How else can you characterize the claim that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax? NBC's announced plans to feature Jones on her Sunday news program resulted in a massive outcry led by some family members of the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. A number of these individuals say they have been harassed on social media by followers of Jones' program Infowars. JPMorgan Chase pulled its advertising, and Sandy Hook Promise, a group that advocates the prevention of gun-related deaths, canceled Kelly's planned appearance at its upcoming gala event. Their anger is warranted. It's wrong, however, to posit that Kelly or any other journalist should shy away from interviewing influential madmen, despots or agents of disinformation. Jones disseminates messages ranging from the ludicrous to the dangerous. Among his various claims to fame is his peddling of the theory that 9/11 was “an inside job.” But this is not the reason I bring up Arnett’s exchange with bin Laden 20 years ago. Rather, it offers proof that seeking out these exchanges can serve a purpose beyond a ratings grab. Arnett’s interview, as well as one conducted afterward by ABC News’ John Miller, explained why viewers needed to know the name of a man speaking to them from a cave in Afghanistan — a person with the power to reach across the ocean and tear asunder their sense of safety. And both Arnett and Miller knew how to handle a hostile interview subject, even one who sought to box them in with stipulations and rough conditions. The issues and conditions facing Kelly right now are wildly different from those Arnett and Miller dealt with. But the main question now is one those men didn't face, which is whether Kelly can handle Jones, a foaming-at-the-mouth conspiracy theorist who has President Donald Trump’s ear. Anyone who watched Kelly’s cozy one-on-one with Trump (following his long media feud with her) or her more recent conversation with President Vladmir Putin  two Sundays ago is correct to suspect that she’s not up to that task. Here's another important question: Is there truly value in ""shedding light"" on a man like Jones, a figure who attempts to soften his malignant influence by calling himself a performance artist? Or is Kelly simply doing her part to make Jones another part of the new version of normal? Let’s consider that tête-à-tête with Putin. What value did viewers glean from it? Over and over again Kelly pressed him on intelligence assertions that Russia hacked the 2016 presidential election and alleged connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign — questions the former KGB lieutenant colonel was ready to respond to with smooth denials, deflecting and redirection. Kelly managed to slide in one question that alluded to his suppression of journalism and free speech with no follow-up. Regarding Russia’s involvement with Syria or his view of Russia’s relationship to NATO or the European Union, Kelly asked . . . nothing. At a time when, according to data released in April by the Pew Research Center, some 31 percent of the Americans surveyed said they see Russia as presenting the greatest danger to the U.S., these would have been useful questions to ask. Putin would have obfuscated the facts in those instances, too — that’s what he does — but it would have been a different sort of denial, and that can be just as informative. But then anyone who has watched Kelly’s orchestrated displays of force in her former role at Fox News would have known this. The typical broadcast news consumer probably became familiar with Kelly from her humbling of Fox News contributor Karl Rove on the night the 2012 election results came in — or during the August 2015 Republican primary debate she moderated. That's when she confronted Trump on his history of misogyny, citing the fact that he had referred to women as “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” Not surprisingly these moments earned her the attention and something approximating respect from liberal voices in the media. As I have previously written, Kelly is a master of sculpting her image to fit her career goals. Her smackdowns of patronizing sexists such as Fox News host Lou Dobbs and conservative radio host Mike Gallagher were well-aimed haymakers on soft targets, a matter of a personality adored by her audience triumphantly stomping on a couple of blowhards who underestimated her willingness to go on the attack as well as her popularity. And one day she may prove herself to be a formidable interviewer. Somewhere deep down, she has the tools, although they could be a little rusty. Prior to entering the news business, Kelly spent a decade as a corporate litigator, a profession built on research, extensive knowledge of subject matter and a willingness to argue specific viewpoints. All of these are qualities hard-hitting reporting requires. It’s also important to remember that as part of her rise at Fox News, however, Kelly styled herself as a provocateur who enabled flimsy headline grabbers and guests whose views were, to put it kindly, factually challenged. People like these require a sharp sense of skepticism, not a resting defense. Two examples of this are her coverage of a conspiracy alleging widespread voter intimidation by a little-known group called the New Black Panther Party. Most people have never heard of it; if you have, it may be because you viewed one of Kelly’s 45 segments that aired in 2013 about an account of intimidation that has since been discredited. (This was merely one of many cases where Kelly engaged in race-baiting to rile up her audience.) As the host of “The Kelly File,” Kelly also made the president of the Family Research Council, Tony Perkins, a frequent guest, rarely countering his baseless anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. For that matter, Kelly also took part in pushing Fox News’ hysteria surrounding Benghazi. Again unless you watched Kelly with any regularity on Fox News before she set her sights on moving to a place where she could practice “real” journalism, these aspects of her interviewing style may come as surprising. Everyone evolves with experience, of course, and one may presume that Kelly will take more care with what she says about victims of police brutality or immigrants now that she’s at NBC News than she did at her previous place of employment. (Maybe.) Moreover, it is possible to use a broadcast platform to tear down dangerous people unfit for broad consumption. But if Kelly and her producers couldn’t call on any credible intelligence officials or dissidents to counter Putin’s propaganda, then we cannot count on Kelly lending much in the way of enlightening context to our consideration of Jones. Even “Full Frontal” host Samantha Bee was able to get Russian-American journalist Masha Gessen and dissident Vladimir Kara-Murza to go on the record, and he has been poisoned twice! The Infowars host himself purportedly wants NBC to pull the interview. From the little that I know about him, I suspect his furor to be ersatz in nature, part of a ploy to get more viewers to tune in. Outrage is a wonderful ratings magnet, and NBC and Kelly may be counting on that to gain exposure for a show that's struggled to attract viewers. In the end, this may illuminate more about the host of ""Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly"" and her new employers than telling us anything we don't already know about its controversial guest.

330,https://www.salon.com/2017/06/16/megyn-kelly-and-alex-jones-two-peas-in-a-pod_partner/,"This article originally appeared on AlterNet.  Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones actually have a fair amount in common. Both have spent the last couple of years denigrating Black Lives Matter, Kelly on her old Fox News show and Jones in a seemingly infinite number of Infowars segments. Both have done their fair share to push fevered conspiracy theories involving the New Black Panthers, a group with a fraction of the KKK’s membership or the alt-right’s influence, but a better fit boogeymen-wise for an audience of white racists. Both Kelly and Jones have leaned into the ridiculous idea that Christmas — a rhetorical stand-in for White America™ — is being destroyed in a war waged by godless multiculturalists. And though their styles may differ dramatically, both have made careers out of shamelessly hyping the fears, stoking the paranoia and bolstering the bigotry of the right. In the flap over Kelly’s upcoming interview with Jones, one fact critics keep missing, or willfully ignoring, is that Kelly and Jones are two sides of the same coin. Sure, Jones arguably says more outlandish things from a position that used to be the far lunatic fringe. But Kelly spent more than a decade doing her own version of the right-wing’s dirty work from within the establishment at Fox News. The difference between Kelly and Jones, at the end of the day, amounts to nothing more than aesthetics. Together, their steady output of garbage has helped expand and thicken our current toxic atmosphere, which is now engulfing and threatening to choke us. For evidence, just revisit Kelly’s body of work. Remember that she once characterized remarks emphasizing the need for a racially diverse judiciary by then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor as an example of “reverse racism.” She accused Michelle Obama of perpetuating a “culture of victimization” for publicly relaying a personal experience with racism, and falsely suggestedPresident Obama was going to force communities deemed ""too white [and] too privileged"" to integrate ""whether [they] want it or not."" In one 2015 segment, Kelly wondered aloud if finishing high school and getting a job is “valued in the black communities,” and in another, she derided a 15-year-old black teenage girl tackled by a white cop twice her size as “no saint.” Kelly spent 45 segmentsrelentlessly promoting an absurd conspiracy theory linking the Obama administration and the New Black Panther Party in an anti-white voter suppression effort, suggesting a twin obsession with delegitimizing the first black president and turning a marginal group into a brand-new scary black thing. Also, never forget her insistence that both Santa Claus and Jesus are white, admonishing naysayers that “just because it makes you feel uncomfortable doesn’t mean it has to change.” Kelly’s resume is basically a catalog of her contributions to a culture of white racial resentment, fear of the other, counterfactual thinking, and right-wing paranoia that inevitably gives rise to a character like Jones. To take stock of the cultural impact of Kelly — and Fox News, for that matter — is to recognize the symbiotic relationship she has with Jones and his followers. Alex Jones couldn’t possibly have become a household name without the work Kelly — along with other right-wing mouthpieces like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity — put in for more than a decade at her old job. If Jones doesn’t open their interview with a handshake and a hearty thank-you, Kelly should be pissed. We’re supposed to buy that Jones and Kelly are not alike, though, which hinges on the idea that Megyn Kelly has changed. The effort to rebrand and reform her image started quietly, gaining momentum ahead of the announcement of her NBC deal. It’s absolutely true that Kelly should never have had to endure years of workplace sexual harassment from Roger Ailes, and neither did she deserve the misogynist bullying from Donald Trump and his supporters that followed her questioning Trump on his long history of . . . misogynist bullying. But the mainstream assumption that those experiences transformed Kelly into a feminist hero, despite all evidence to the contrary, was misguided. It was also fortuitous, and did a tremendous amount to shift Kelly’s image toward the center. So did a few of Kelly’s deliberate moves, such as joining a league of vocal Democratic celebrities including Kerry Washington, Emma Watson, Lena Dunham and Eva Longoria on “Lean in Together,” a feminist-lite campaign led by Sheryl Sandberg. Kelly also published a memoir in 2016, ""Settle For More"", that was promoted in press materials that took pains to note she is “respected by . . . Republicans and Democrats” and has “fans across the political divide.” Atlantic contributor Caitlin Flanagin cites an NPR interview in which Kelly state she's interested in the “relative lack of power of certain minority groups and the fear they’re feeling in the wake of Donald Trump’s election.” It’s an interesting area of attraction for Kelly, given that it runs counter to nearly everything she’s ever done. The subtext of Kelly’s interview with Jones is more of the same. The idea is to put Kelly in a seat of judgment over someone whose ideas are so abhorrent and despicable, so clearly wacked-out, that her background is virtually erased by osmosis. In a statement aimed at taking the heat off after outrage erupted around the interview, Kelly stated that her “goal in sitting down with [Jones] was to shine a light — as journalists are supposed to do — on this influential figure.” Except that the best way to illuminate how horrific and irresponsible Jones’ cult of personality is would be to interview those he’s harmed the most—the parents of children who were murdered in the Sandy Hook mass shooting, who have been pleading with Kelly for weeks to drop this whole thing. Infowars reached 4.5 million people between May 16 to June 14 according to Quantcast, while Jones' radio show attracted millions more. Jones’ audience extends far enough that he’s come to the attention of yogurt behemoth Chobani, which sued Jones and won a retraction. A few months prior, Jones bowed to public pressure and apologized for promoting a bizarre conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton ran a child sex ring out of a Washington, D.C., pizzeria, a notion that attracted a nutjob with an AR-15 rifle. Jones claims mass shootings at Sandy Hook, the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Brussels and Boston were “false flag” operations. He says 9/11 was an inside job and believes antidepressants in the oceans are making shrimp suicidal and chemicals in the water are making “the friggin’ frogs gay.” Jones may well be in need of something — a mental health intervention, anger management classes or a new best friend. But what he does not need is access to a wider audience, especially since the president is one of his biggest fans. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump called into Jones’ radio show and praised the host as “amazing,” promising “I will not let you down.” Now Infowars has White House press credentials and the president’s ear. “Have you seen how the president sounds just like me?” Jones said on a recent episode. “Have you seen how Stephen Bannon sounds just like me? Have you seen how the whole paradigm’s globally shifting and you can’t hold it back?” This is who Kelly is helping. As one Sandy Hook parent noted, it is especially cruel that Kelly’s interview with Jones will run on Father's Day. But the clear priority here is ratings, since Kelly’s viewership is already down 42 percent since her show’s debut. It’s the same old Kelly, despite all the efforts to convince us otherwise. “I have no mea culpa to offer,"" Kelly—who Newsweek described as ""soulless, heartless, shameless, avaricious"" — recently told the Daily News when asked if she felt any contrition for all the damaging crap she’s spewed. ""I had the number one show in all of cable news in the demo (advertiser-friendly viewers 25-to-54 years old).” None of that matters to the Sandy Hook families, who fear Jones’ interview will set off a retraumatizing set of events. “We have been harassed repeatedly by people who we call hoaxers that think this hasn’t happened,” Cristina Hassinger, the daughter of Dawn Hochsprung, the school principal, told the New York Times. “When there is going to be such a widely available interview with attention given to one of the hoaxer ringleaders, it is going to unleash the trolls on us tenfold all over again.” Kali Holloway is the senior director of Make It Right, a project of the Independent Media Institute. She co-curated the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s MetLiveArts 2017 summer performance and film series, “Theater of the Resist.” She previously worked on the HBO documentary Southern Rites, PBS documentary The New Public and Emmy-nominated film Brooklyn Castle, and Outreach Consultant on the award-winning documentary The New Black.

'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the New York Times Editorial Board assigning blame to Gabrielle Giffords' shooting in 2011 to Sarah Palin So much for unity. Just when a debate erupts over the role of media and mendacity in the shooting of a Republican congressman, the New York Times revives a discredited theory about the six-year-old shooting of a Democratic congresswoman. This was so egregious and embarrassing that the Times editorial page was compelled yesterday to run a correction. And worse than that, it was utterly tone-deaf in the wake of the shooting of Steve Scalise and four others, with the Republican whip still in critical condition. The editorial seemed to say, the hell with that, what about right-wing hatred? The argument involving the near-fatal shooting of Gabby Giffords wasn’t true at the time, and appears even more ludicrous in retrospect. To resurrect it now undercuts any effort at breaking the cycle of guilt by association. The editorial suggests that it’s fine to blame conservative rhetoric, but not liberal rhetoric, for senseless violence. Here’s what the Times said: “Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin’s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. “Conservatives and right-wing media were quick on Wednesday to demand forceful condemnation of hate speech and crimes by anti-Trump liberals. They’re right. Though there’s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack, liberals should of course hold themselves to the same standard of decency that they ask of the right.” Palin’s use of the crosshairs may have been unfortunate, but to link it to the mass shooting was, and is, nonsensical. As I wrote on the day of the Giffords shooting, well before I worked at Fox: “This isn't about a nearly year-old Sarah Palin map; it's about a lone nutjob who doesn't value human life.” The Times has now published this correction: “An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established.” In Tuesday’s shooting in Virginia, James Hodgkinson was an anti-Trump zealot who despised Republicans and volunteered for Bernie Sanders—not that that makes him a stand-in for every liberal who doesn’t like the president. But Loughner was a delusional guy with incoherent political views. He had been obsessed with Giffords for years, and there’s no evidence he even saw the Palin committee’s map. National Review’s David French noted that the Times’s own reporting from six years ago invalidates the editorial: “As he alienated himself from his small clutch of friends, grew contemptuous of women in positions of power and became increasingly oblivious to basic social mores, Mr. Loughner seemed to develop a dreamy alternate world, where the sky was sometimes orange, the grass sometimes blue and the Internet’s informational chaos provided refuge.” Palin tweeted yesterday that she is talking to lawyers and “exploring options.” This erroneous attack was beneath the New York Times.

          / CBS/AP WASHINGTON -- In the nation's capital, and dozens of other cities across the U.S., supporters of LGBT rights mobilized for marches and rallies Sunday, celebrating their gains but angered over threats to those advances. The centerpiece event, the Equality March in Washington, was endorsed by virtually every major national advocacy group working on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Leaders of those groups have been embittered by several actions of President Donald Trump's administration -- including the rollback of federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. The activists also complain that Mr. Trump, although he campaigned as a potential ally of gays and lesbians, has stocked his administration with many foes of LGBT-rights advances, including Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Roughly 100 marches and rallies were planned across the U.S., from Portland, Maine, and Boston to Anchorage, Alaska, and Honolulu. Activists in Casper, Wyoming, planned that city's first-ever pride parade. More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out in Los Angeles where the annual Pride Parade was renamed the ResistMarch. Participants gathered in Hollywood on Sunday morning and were expected to travel to West Hollywood, CBS Los Angeles reports. ""I really love the fact that the LGBT community is going back to its roots and we're making it a march instead of a parade,"" one participant said. ""For years we've been celebrating and making it's big fiesta, a big party, and now we're taking it serious and we're out here to let this administration know we're not very happy with what's going on."" In Washington, throngs of marchers, many thousands strong, paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol, trailing behind a giant rainbow flag near the head of the procession. ""We're here, we're queer, get that Chito out of here,"" was among the chants directed at Mr. Trump. For the LGBT community nationwide, it's an emotional time. Monday is the anniversary of the mass shooting a year ago in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people -- mostly Latinos -- at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Among the marchers in Washington was Gil Mendez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled with his partner all the way from San Francisco to join the parade. He carried a sign that included the names of all the Pulse victims. ""The arrack on Pulse really struck me hard,"" he said. ""It made the connection between the physical violence of guns and the political attacks on our community."" Also marching, and singing freedom songs along the way, was Gregory Elfers of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was with fellow members of the New York City Gay Men's Chorus. ""It's an opportunity to tell everyone we're still here, and we're not going away at all,"" he said. Among the activist leaders on hand in Washington was Sarah Kate Ellis, president of GLAAD, which monitors media coverage of the LGBT community. She noted that Mr. Trump, breaking from the practice of President Barack Obama, has declined to issue a proclamation in honor of Pride Month, and that the Trump administration has deleted questions about sexual orientation from planned federal surveys. ""If you look at their prioritization, we're really low on it,"" she said. ""There absolutely is a resistance aspect to this march.""

335,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2017/06/14/alexandria-shooting-bloody-trail-leaves-capital-shaken/5J3BUDLN5iIt3azitw4EMO/story.html,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — One congressman was up before the sun, riding his bike 9 miles, across the Potomac, to take batting practice. Another brought his 10-year-old son to watch. They wore ball caps and T-shirts, caught pop flies and fielded ground balls, a quiet, innocent respite amid a political season that was anything but. And then gunfire rang out, surreal blasts amid the soft thwack of mitts and bats. One of the GOP representatives went down near second base, leaving a bloody trail behind as he dragged himself away from the shooter into the outfield. As the burst of gunfire continued, others ran for cover and dove into the dugout behind first base. Advertisement The attack by a lone gunman on Republicans practicing for an annual ballgame against Democratic colleagues wounded a congressman, a congressional staffer, a lobbyist, and a Capitol police officer. It also deeply shook a national capital that was already balancing on what often seems to be a razor’s edge. Now, even a baseball practice, a time-honored ritual that remains one of the few activities left in Washington that bridges ideological divides, was subject to irrational political hate and the horror of a mass shooting. “This is one of those occasions where Republicans and Democrats can get together,” said Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama who was at the practice. “For someone to start trying to take out congressmen under those circumstances is just unconscionable.” “You’re helpless,” he added. “You have a baseball bat; they have a rifle.” The scene unfolded early Wednesday morning as Republican members of Congress gathered at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park for their daily baseball practice. The next night, they would take the field against Democrats at Nationals Park for a night of bipartisan bonding and charitable good works. The practice field chosen by the Republicans sits next to a YMCA in a neighborhood of Alexandria known for its renowned frozen custard shop, its street festivals, and its tight-knit community. Advertisement As the team turned from field practice to batting practice, two congressmen decided to  head back to Capitol Hill to beat the traffic. As they were leaving, a man approached. Are these Republicans or Democrats out on the field, he asked. “Republicans,” responded Representative Jeff Duncan, a South Carolina Republican, who later recounted the exchange. That man was later identified as James Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old from Illinois who has a long record with law enforcement as well as a well-documented and politically charged opposition to President Trump. “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co,” he had written on Facebook, on a personal homepage that featured photos of Senator Bernie Sanders. On each morning in recent weeks, Hodgkinson frequented the YMCA that sits adjacent to the ball field, according to a report in The Washington Post. And on Wednesday just after 7 a.m. — after he asked the two congressmen who was out in the field — the first shot rang out, from somewhere behind the third-base dugout. “I thought it was a car backfiring at first,” said Brooks, the Alabama congressman who was swinging his bat in the batting cage. “Until I saw the rifle barrel. And a white male taking careful aim at congressmen, staffers, whoever he could get ahold of.” House majority whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, fell to the ground at second base. He screamed out in pain. He began crawling into the outfield for some 15 yards, trying to get away, a trail of blood behind him. Advertisement People yelled: “Active shooter! Active shooter!” Those on the field frantically searched for cover as the shooter targeted them with an assault rifle. Bullets whizzed in rapid succession. Marty LaVor, a Washington-based freelance photographer who was taking pictures of the practice, scrambled into the first-base dugout. “Get closer to the wall!” a staffer shouted. “Get down!” Brooks, the congressman, first hid behind the batting cage, but then was worried he could be exposed if the shooter changed positions. So during a pause in firing, he and others raced to join lawmakers and staffers in the first-base dugout. “We’re breathing dugout dust, face-first down,” Brooks said. A dozen others were there. Some got on cellphones, calling for help. Others turned toward Zack Barth, a congressional staffer who had been shot in his calf. Brooks ripped off his belt and someone else began using it as a tourniquet. Barth, Brooks said, “was gutsy.” “He was saying it wasn’t bad at all,” Brooks said. “But I mean, there was a hole in his leg. So we put on the tourniquet despite his remarks.” Casualties would have been worse, said witnesses, if it had not been for happenstance. Two armed Capitol Police officers were at the scene to provide security for Scalise, a member of top House leadership. Advertisement The officers fired at the gunman as the congressmen taking cover in the dugout could only look at Scalise, who lay motionless in the outfield. “The shooter is down,” someone eventually said. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, immediately ran out to Scalise and used his hands to apply pressure on his wound, where he had been shot in the hip. Representative Brad Wenstrup, a Republican from Ohio who is a podiatrist in the Army Reserves, cut away Scalise’s uniform and applied gauze. Scalice was conscious and asked for water. “He was obviously in a great deal of pain,” Flake said. “We were there for 10 or 15 minutes before the medics arrived.” As soon as Scalise was in the ambulance, Flake got Scalise’s cellphone and called his wife, delivering the news before she heard about it from the media. Flake, still in his red uniform with “Republicans” emblazoned on it, was visibly shaken as he recounted the morning to reporters at the scene. Brooks, with his Rawlings batting glove still on his left hand, also recounted his shock, as he stood about 100 yards from a baseball diamond that had turned into a crime scene. Glass was shattered in the nearby YMCA windows. A black SUV parked nearby had a broken window, too. Donna Bernstein, who was at a neighboring gym when gunshots rang out, said she walked outside around 7 a.m. and witnessed the commotion of first responders. She was dismayed to learn that a gunmen had targeted the group. “We’re going in the wrong direction,” Bernstein said of the country, her head hanging in sadness. Advertisement It also did not take long for partisan blame to creep into the debate. Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican, said the political culture driven by the “left” created an environment where violence against elected leaders was possible. “I don’t know anything about the perpetrator,” said King. “But I do know that America is divided. . . . And the violence is appearing in the streets. And it’s coming from the left.” King learned about the shooting while in a meeting with other members of the House Republican conference. “Our discussion this morning was to be about the disappearance of the American center. And the polarization of our country that has taken place,” King said. “I regret what I’ve seen in this society. This bitterness. This acrimony. This division that’s taking place.” President Trump, during remarks at the White House after the incident, stuck to a more unified tone focused on the heroism of the police and the hope for Scalise’s recovery. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans,” he said. “Our children deserve to grow up in nation of safety and peace and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good.” News emerged that Hodgkinson was a volunteer on Senator Sanders’ presidential campaign. “I am sickened by this despicable act,’’ Sanders said on the Senate floor after learning the shooter had been a volunteer. “Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values.’’ The mood on Capitol Hill was somber but also one of resolve to convert the incident into something positive. Some want the dialogue to improve. There’s talk about whether security needs to be enhanced. And nearly all were adamant that the baseball game will be played on Thursday night. “We’re going to play,” said Representative Roger Williams, a Texas Republican who was walking with crutches due to injuries sustained in the shooting. “We need to play this baseball game.” House Speaker Paul Ryan gave a powerful speech on the floor about five hours after the morning attack. “We are united,” he said. “We are united in our shock, we are united in our anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.” The room rose, with members of both parties standing in ovation.

337,https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2017/06/13/megyn-kelly-dropped-as-host-of-sandy-hook-gala-due-to-alex-jones-interview,"By Kevin Slane   Megyn Kelly is stepping down from a hosting job — though not her new gig at NBC. Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention nonprofit created after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, announced in a statement Monday night that they had asked Kelly to step down as host of their annual Promise Champion Gala in light of Kelly’s upcoming interview with radio host and InfoWars founder Alex Jones. Jones has said he believes that the shooting was a government hoax that used child actors. “Sandy Hook Promise, a leading gun violence prevention organization, and NBC host Megyn Kelly have agreed that Kelly will no longer host the organization’s annual Promise Champions Gala on Wednesday, June 14th, in Washington DC,” the statement reads. “This decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT, was a hoax.”   Kelly’s interview with Jones is scheduled to air on Sunday’s episode of Kelly’s new show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly. After Kelly posted a teaser for the interview on Twitter this past Sunday night, Nelba Márquez-Greene, whose daughter Ana was killed in the shooting, posted a series of tweets criticizing the host for giving Jones a platform. “In @megynkelly ‘s America, cruelty gets u on national TV on Father’s Day,” Márquez-Greene wrote in one tweet. “#SandyHook grieving dads will go to the cemetery. #thisisnotnormal” On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that banking company J.P. Morgan & Chase asked for all of its TV and digital ads be removed from promotions for Sunday’s episode due to the Jones interview.   Sandy Hook Promise cofounder and managing director Nicole Hockley said in the nonprofit’s statement that the organization hopes NBC will not broadcast the interview. “Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host,” Hockley said in the statement. “It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.” Jones himself released a video Monday night in which he said he doesn’t want the interview to air, claiming Kelly misrepresented his views and took his words out of context.   “I agree with the families of the victims of Sandy Hook,” Jones said in the video. “The Alex Jones profile interview with Megyn Kelly does not need to air, it needs to be shelved.”  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

News By Ruth Brown Submit June 19, 2017 | 12:54pm				| Updated June 19, 2017 | 2:29pm A man inadvertently streamed a mass shooting on Facebook Live — believing he was filming people dancing in the street, according to reports. Bubba Hinson’s video of a gunman opening fire and wounding six people during an argument at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Sunday has since racked up more than a million views, much to his dismay, the News and Observer reports. “I always wanted a viral video, but I never wanted it to be like this,” Hinson told the news outlet. Hinson, a volunteer firefighter in town for a convention, says he saw a throng of people blocking traffic around 12:25 a.m. and started streaming the gathering on his Facebook page, expecting people to bust a move. Instead, someone pulled out a gun and busted some caps. “I thought they were dancing. That’s why I started filming it,” he told the paper. “Then, they started fighting. Then, they started shooting.” The video shows a group of people brawling before someone pulls out a gun and fires off at least 15 rounds, sending the crowd screaming and running for their lives. “Multiple people down!” Hinson shouts as he narrates the mayhem. At least six people were shot and sustained “non-life-threatening injuries,” and an armed security guard also shot the gunman, the News and Observer reports. The shooter fled by carjacking a vehicle, but cops caught up with him a few hours later. The shooting was just one of three in a bloody weekend for the tourist town. Another gunman wounded a man in the parking lot of a Myrtle Beach mall the day before, just 10 minutes before cops were dispatched to a shooting at a local resort, although no one was hit there. Some vacationers told the News and Observer they won’t be returning to the city anytime soon. “We’re just here on vacation,” said visitor John Lee, whose friend’s car ended up covered in bullet holes and blood after Sunday’s shooting. “This sucks.” Read Next Paris attacker was known to cops as a terror threat Share Selection This story has been shared 45,874 times.

All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Omar Mateen, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a 9 mm pistol, entered the crowded Pulse nightclub in Orlando and opened fire at about 2 a.m. on June 12, 2016. Those who weren’t hit by flying bullets or falling people ran toward the doors or to anywhere they could take cover. Mateen fired at anything that moved inside the popular gay club. The calls to 911 followed within seconds. And just minutes after the shooting began, local police officers arrived. Belle Isle Police Officer Brandon Cornwell and a half-dozen other local law enforcement officers broke through a large window and entered the club, knowing Mateen was likely still inside. The harrowing scene was recorded by Cornwell’s body camera. On the video, which was released on June 1 by the Orlando Police Department, screams can be heard echoing through the dark club. Televisions above the bar were still playing music videos. The officers entered one of the bathrooms by the bar. “Clear!” they yelled. Another officer, holding a long gun and leading the group, inched farther into the club. “Where the fuck is this coming from?” he said of the desperate screams. They saw a door leading to another bathroom. There were noises, something on the other side of the door. The officers moved into position, preparing for a shootout and knowing from the cries that civilians could be in the crossfire. “He’s loading. He’s in there,” one of the officers said. Cornwell’s dispatch radio chirped. Ducking behind the bar, he answered calmly: “I’m inside. Suspect is barricaded inside with multiple hostages. We have multiple down and shot inside the bar. Can’t get them out at this time.” Just then, one of the other officers screamed: “Let me see your hands now!” Shots rang out.

Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Cornwell, keeping a line of sight on the bathroom door, exhaled a sigh. “Lord Jesus, watch over me,” he said. Inside the bathroom, at about 2:30 a.m., with those officers just outside the door, Mateen called 911. When the operator answered, Mateen was saying a prayer in Arabic. “What?” the operator asked, not understanding him. Mateen continued to pray, and then changed to English. “I want to let you know that I’m in Orlando and I did the shooting,” he said calmly. “What’s your name?” the operator asked. Mateen didn’t say. Instead, he said he pledged his allegiance to ISIS and hung up. He then talked for about 30 minutes, in a series of phone calls, with hostage negotiators. “You have to tell America to stop bombing Syria and Iraq. They’re killing a lot of innocent people. So what am I to do here when my people are getting killed over there?” he told the negotiators. Mateen claimed there were car bombs outside the club and said his attack was triggered by the May 2016 U.S. airstrike that killed senior ISIS member Abu Wahib. Outside the club, Orlando Police Officer Justin Wilkins arrived to provide assistance. His body camera recorded as he walked up to other officers and asked what was happening. “He’s still in the club,” an officer told Wilkins. “At least we fucking are going to get this guy,” Wilkins responded. They did get Mateen, by busting through a wall with an armored vehicle and then shooting him eight times. But not before Mateen had killed 49 people and wounded 58 others in the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001. Today, a year after this mass shooting, questions remain about the how the FBI, despite having twice investigated Mateen before the attack, did not designate him as a security threat. And this wasn’t the first time that the FBI had missed such a threat since 9/11. The FBI had investigated Tamerlan Tsarnaev before he and his younger brother Dzhokhar killed three and injured hundreds more in the Boston Marathon bombings. In the aftermath of the Orlando mass shooting, FBI Director James Comey promised a full review of the bureau’s threat assessment system. “I don’t see anything, in reviewing our work, that our agents should have done differently, but we’ll look at it in an open and honest way and be transparent about it,” Comey told reporters during a press conference. “Our work is very challenging. We are looking for needles in a nationwide haystack. But we’re also called upon to figure out which pieces of hay might someday become needles. That is hard work. If we can find a way to do that better, we will.” If the FBI has found a better way to find those needles, the bureau has not been as transparent as Comey promised. Asked what, if any, counterterrorism policy changes were made as a result of the Orlando attack, the FBI answered: “We have no comment.” “There’s no transparency on these cases. So you cannot — you simply cannot — make a good judgment about the Mateen case,” said Jeffrey Danik, a retired supervisory FBI agent who is now critical of his former employer. “Did law enforcement do a great job and were they heroes, or were they bumbling, inept dopes? Almost impossible to make the call unless you see the record. Who knew what, and what did they know? The next step is more difficult. What could we do differently? Well, because of the lack of transparency, we don’t know what we did wrong.” Born in New York to Afghan parents, Mateen grew up in Port St. Lucie, Florida, a sleepy town about 115 miles north of Miami. It’s a mixture of small-town Florida natives and retirees, as well as a contingent of more metropolitan South Floridians fleeing rising living costs near Miami. Mateen attended public school and went on to obtain an associate’s degree in criminal justice at the local community college in 2006. He applied to be a prison guard with the Florida Department of Corrections, and in his application he admitted to getting into a fight as a minor that resulted in a misdemeanor battery charge. “I did not get handcuffed and I did not go to jail,” he wrote in his application. “It was an experience of me growing up and I learned a big lesson from it.” The Florida state prison system hired Mateen into its trainee guard program, but he was dismissed after six months for undisclosed reasons, the first of several failures to launch a law enforcement career. He also tried to enroll in the police academy but was denied. He then took a job as a security guard with the private security firm G4S. Mateen’s posts included the county courthouse, a golf club, and a gated residential community. He obtained a firearms permit for the job. In 2008, Mateen met on MySpace the woman who would become his first wife, Uzbekistan-born Sitora Yusufiy. After they married, Yusufiy moved to Florida, but their marriage was volatile, and Mateen allegedly abusive, so the union didn’t last. Mateen met his second wife, Noor Salman, online as well, this time through an online dating site. She lived near San Francisco, and after their marriage in 2011, they settled in Florida. A couple of years after the marriage, in 2013, Mateen first came to the FBI’s attention when other G4S employees reported that he claimed to have connections with terrorists. The FBI employed an informant to get to know Mateen, but the investigation did not substantiate ties with terrorism. In fact, when the FBI interviewed Mateen, he told agents that he made those comments to scare his co-workers, who had made fun of his religion. The FBI closed its investigation. A year later, Mateen was back in the FBI’s sights. The bureau was investigating Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who, having joined Nusra Front, became the first American suicide bomber in Syria. FBI agents discovered that Mateen and Abusalha attended the same mosque and were casual acquaintances. This, coupled with their previous suspicions of Mateen, prompted counterterrorism agents to open a second investigation. FBI agents interviewed Mateen once again, but his answers to their questions appear to have been enough to alleviate concerns. The FBI closed its second investigation of Mateen, and this appears to be the last contact the bureau had with Mateen before the Orlando attack. By 2016, Mateen and Salman had a 3-year-old son. That spring, Mateen purchased firearms and ammunition, which Salman later admitted to knowing about. He also made a couple of comments to his wife that suggested violence. “How bad would it be if a club got attacked?” Mateen asked her, according to an account Salman would later give to investigators. During an early June trip to Disney Springs, a shopping and dining complex that is part of the larger Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Mateen asked her: “What would make people more upset — an attack on downtown Disney or a club?” Later that month, Mateen made clear his answer to that question.

Photo: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images The exact motivations of terrorists can often be difficult to identify. In the immediate aftermath of the Pulse shooting, speculation mounted that Mateen could have been secretly gay, his violence an act of self-loathing homophobia rather than Islamic terrorism. His pledge to ISIS? Just a way gain attention or maybe bolster his machismo, according to the theory. Several men reported having seen Mateen at Pulse in the past, and others said they recognized his photograph from dating apps. Fusion aired an interview with a man using the name Miguel, his voice altered and wearing a disguise, who claimed to have been Mateen’s lover. But after investigating these leads, the FBI found no credible evidence to support the theory that Mateen was gay. Instead, agents suspected that he’d followed a well-worn path of extremists in the United States by being influenced online by propaganda from ISIS and other groups. An examination of Mateen’s laptop after the shooting revealed that he had watched extremist videos online and was looking for information about ISIS — suggesting that the FBI investigations in 2013 and 2014 did not uncover this behavior or that Mateen only began to be radicalized after the final investigation in 2014. Either way, this failure reveals potential flaws in the FBI’s assessments — low-level investigations conducted in response to vague tips, such as the one from Mateen’s co-workers who claimed that he had bragged about having terrorist connections. Although there is no legal time limit for assessments, the bureau as a practical matter limits them to 60 or 90 days, unless agents find information that justifies an extension. Because of the bureau’s policy after 9/11 to pursue every terrorism lead, no matter how far-fetched, assessments pile up. Closing assessments that can’t be advanced immediately becomes a bureaucratic response. As a result, the investigations of Mateen may have occurred during narrow windows of time when he was not exhibiting behavior that suggested the violence to come. “There are so many assessments, and the agents and supervisors can get complacent in closing these quickly: get ’em off the plate, get ’em off the plate, get ’em off the plate,” Danik, the former FBI supervisory agent, said. “You don’t want to be chasing people too long.” Following the Orlando mass shooting, there were calls for congressional hearings (none of which addressed the FBI’s intelligence failures in Orlando) and new laws to restrict gun sales to people on the terrorist watch list (which the Senate voted down). Inside the FBI, it’s unclear what, if any, internal reviews took place. “The FBI doesn’t do self-criticism very well, and the inspections are designed to exonerate and build a defense against outside criticism that might justify taking away FBI authorities or resources,” said Michael German, a former FBI agent who is now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program. “To the extent they needed to lay blame, they typically look for a scapegoat rather than the true source of the problems.” Whatever flaws in the FBI assessment process that allowed Mateen not to be designated a threat last year, they likely still exist today. “Information about these terrorism cases, especially when one goes sideways like Mateen, none of that’s coming out,” Danik said. “They don’t want to be second guessed. They don’t want to be held accountable.” Top photo: Orlando Police officers direct family members away from a fatal shooting at Pulse Orlando nightclub in Orlando, Fla. on  June 12, 2016.

Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz weighs in on coverage U.S. Capitol security forces are planning to ""beef up"" protections for lawmakers away from Capitol Hill after last week’s mass shooting at the GOP Congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Va., Fox News has learned. Senate Sergeant at Arms Frank Larkin and U.S. Capitol Police briefed all senators on security arrangements at a special meeting at the Capitol Tuesday. Sources say that many of the senators were pleasantly surprised at the resources available to them. “They’re increasing their efforts,” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., as he left the meeting. “More security at events."" As part of their efforts, U.S. Capitol Police could send officers to large gatherings of lawmakers away from the Hill. Officials have also discussed having a larger presence of uniformed officers on House and Senate leaders' protective details to serve as a deterrent. Senior sources declined to tell Fox how much such measures may cost. The U.S. Capitol Police is seeking $427 million in their budget for next fiscal year, an increase of eight percent. The June 14 shooting in Alexandria injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., a legislative aide, a lobbyist and a U.S. Capitol Police office who was part of Scalise's security detail. Several lawmakers said in the aftermath of the shooting that the officers' presence prevented many deaths. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., told the Associated Press last week that he had said he had asked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., before the shooting about increasing budgets for members' offices so they can pay for more security. Currently, the office allowance cannot be used for home security. Congress would have to approve a change in policy. The House sergeant-at-arms is also in touch with the Federal Election Commission about the possibility of allowing the use of campaign funds for security, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. Some lawmakers are talking about carrying a gun with them, although weapons are prohibited in the Capitol and the District of Columbia has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, with carrying a firearm generally prohibited. Metropolitan Police also require that all firearms be registered with them. Still, Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who has a permit in his home state, said, ""It's going to be in my pocket from this day forward."" Asked about carrying a gun, Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, said: ""Sure, I mean I'm from Texas."" And Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican running for Congress, said he has a concealed carry permit and thinks members of Congress should be able to protect themselves.

Let’s not use the occasion of a shooter targeting congressmen on an Alexandria ball field — one of two mass shootings before lunch on Wednesday — to talk about guns, and whether this country’s blind absolutism on the Second Amendment merits reconsideration. Speaking of such things now would be opportunistic. It would disrespect the victims, not to mention millions of law-abiding gun owners. It would be un-American. Democrats and others on the left are always trying to talk about guns at times like these. As if a gun had killed the UPS employees in San Francisco on Wednesday morning, rather than the co-worker who shot it. As if anything could be done to stop an unhinged man from Illinois from getting his hands on enough weaponry to bring mayhem and bloodshed to a ball field where Republicans prepared for a rare moment of comity with Democrats. Let’s not talk about Wednesday’s tragedies, two of the 1,399 mass shootings since 20 small children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook less than five years ago, as if slowing the flood of guns might have prevented them. Advertisement Let’s not talk about the correlation between the millions the National Rifle Association gives to the very Congress targeted on that ball field, and the waves of weapons washing over the country. Let’s not talk about the $30 million the NRA poured into making Donald Trump president, support he has vowed to justify. This would not be the time to bring up the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which would render moot strict gun laws in states like Massachusetts by guaranteeing that people with a concealed-carry permit in one state could take their guns into any other. Advertisement Let’s not talk about the hearing canceled Wednesday in the wake of the shooting in Alexandria, the one on legislation that would make it easier to buy silencers. Advocates say they just want to protect hunters’ hearing. Let’s not talk about how we prevent a person like James Hodgkinson, who attacked the GOP baseball practice, from getting a gun. Hodgkinson had been arrested for punching his daughter’s friend in the face, firing warning shots at her boyfriend and hitting him with the butt of a gun, and battering his daughter, according to The Daily Beast. We can talk about toxic rhetoric, though. Depending on whose it is. Leaders who have been conspicuously silent on such rhetoric when white supremacists commit mass murder, or when victims are Muslims, pounced upon Hodgkinson’s unhinged hatred of Trump, tarring all Democrats with his detestable act. “Violence is appearing in the streets, and it’s coming from the left,” said Iowa Representative Steve King, a Republican who has himself expressed white nationalist views. “People that can’t accept the results of the election . . . are determined to take this country down.” His sentiments were echoed by the unspeakable former speaker Newt Gingrich, who linked the shooting to “an increasing intensity of hostility on the left.” They said these things as if Bernie Sanders or any credible leader on the left had ever called for violence. Where were they when the president urged supporters to rough up protesters, mused that “Second Amendment folks” could do something about a president Hillary Clinton, and welcomed Ted Nugent — who has advocated violence against both Clinton and Barack Obama — to dinner at the White House? Advertisement But let’s not talk about that. Or about guns. Today is not the time for that. Neither is tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the one after that.

343,https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2017/06/19/megyn-kellys-controversial-alex-jones-interview-elicited-praise-disgust,"By Kevin Slane   After a week of buildup, backlash, retooling, and preemption, Megyn Kelly’s interview with Infowars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones aired without incident Sunday night on NBC. Kelly faced criticism from the relatives of victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, for giving Jones a platform for his conspiracy theories. Jones has said he believes that the shooting was a government hoax that used child actors. Reactions to the interview varied widely, with some continuing to argue that giving Jones a platform was the wrong idea. But many viewers — liberal, moderate, and conservative — applauded Kelly for doing her job and giving Jones a tough interview. Watching @megynkelly interview with Alex Jones, I’m even more convinced that her piece wasn’t just ok to do, but important journalism. — Dan Abrams (@danabrams) June 18, 2017  Having suggested we wait to see how Megyn Kelley did with Jones, she did fine. No rational viewer could feel anything for him but disgust. — Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) June 19, 2017  #Megyn Kelly did more to expose the real Alex Jones and than anyone else on TV.

Both pieces intended for audiences that didn’t know much about either — Allan Smith (@akarl_smith) June 18, 2017  If you’re unfamiliar with Alex Jones, and are watching this Megyn Kelly report, hard to imagine you walk away believing anything he says. — Kyle Blaine (@kyletblaine) June 18, 2017  We attacked @megynkelly for the Alex Jones interview, after watching it, we have to apologize. What you did was important. We were wrong. — The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) June 19, 2017  I think @megynkelly proved people underestimated her. She did a great and necessary job interviewing Alex Jones. — Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) June 19, 2017    Not every review of the interview was glowing, though.  In a Boston Globe opinion piece headlined “Megyn Kelly’s interview with a sweaty, stammering Alex Jones wasn’t worth it,” University of Maine journalism professor Michael J. Socolow criticized Kelly for being unable to glean any new information from Jones, arguing that the piece “lacked real news value.” “As in her interviews with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Kelly proved unable to generate surprising, interesting, or even novel responses from her subject,” Socolow wrote. “The package’s heat was sparked only by Kelly’s skeptical challenges — largely sidestepped by a stammering, sweaty Jones — and cutaways to Kelly’s disapproving facial expressions.”   Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan gave the segment a mixed review as well, saying that it avoided any major pratfalls but still elevated Jones’ profile. Bottom line on NBC’s Alex Jones piece: Strong editing gave it an edge & made him look like a kook. Still a win for him; boosts his profile. — Margaret Sullivan (@Sulliview) June 18, 2017  Perhaps the most interesting review came from Politico’s Jack Shafer, who criticized those who wanted the interview scrapped in the first place, comparing their pre-adjudication of the interview to censorship in Soviet Russia. “We don’t abandon free thought and press freedom just because there’s an outside chance that a piece of journalism like Kelly’s might fall to the advantage of a sordid manipulator or a demagogue,” Shafer wrote the piece, titled ‘Megyn Kelly Pantses Alex Jones.’ “Nor does the unspeakable pain the Sandy Hook parents have endured because of Jones mean we must cleanse the news sphere of coverage that might further upset them. Surely it makes more sense to deal straight on with tin-pots like Jones than cover our eyes and ears in hopes he’ll vanish by himself.”   Many chose not to watch the interview at all, including relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.

345,http://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2017/06/16/just-trust-me-alex-jones-has-badly-damaged-nbcs-plans-for-megyn-kelly/,"Megyn Kelly in 2016 (Victoria Will/Invision/AP) Most journalists would agree that if you're going to give an overflowing dumpster of rotting food like Alex Jones a platform on the NBC Television Network, it better be for a good reason. Examples would be exposing him for the vermin he is, and demanding that he justify his outrageous lies--first and foremost that the mass shooting of schoolchildren at Sandy Hook was ""a hoax."" That's what a journalist would do. We learned last night Megyn Kelly is no journalist. ""It’s not going to be a contentious, sort of gotcha exchange,” Kelly (assuming that the voice released on audio recordings Thursday night by Jones is, in fact, that of Megyn Kelly, which so far NBC has not denied) says. ""I just want to talk about you.” I just want to talk about you. This from the woman who defended her interview with Jones this week as unpleasant, but part of the work that reporters must do to ""shine a light"" on the extreme voices in society. Compare that sentiment to this: “My goal is for your listeners and the left, who will be watching some on NBC, to say, ‘Wow that was really interesting.'” Wow, that was really interesting? As in, wow, he actually believes these outrageous and hurtful things? Or, wow, aside from the vile conspiracy theories he spews to an audience of millions on syndicated radio and the internet, he's actually a pretty decent guy with a wonderful sense of humor and a nice collection of guitars? “You'll be fine with it,” Kelly says in the recording released by Jones. “I’m not looking to portray you as a bogeyman...the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this insane version of you in their head walk away saying, ‘You know, I see the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and is more complex than I’ve been led to believe.” What about Sandy Hook? “It really will be about who is that guy,” Kelly stresses. “I’ll ask you about some of the controversy and I’ll ask you and you can respond."" You know, you can. If you want. It's worth trying to imagine those words coming out of a real journalist's mouth--someone, say, like CBS' Ed Bradley, who in 2003 sat down for an extended interview with Michael Jackson, who at the time faced 20 years in prison for allegedly sexually molesting a 13-year-old boy. I'll ask you about some of the controversy and I'll ask you and you can respond. Ed Bradley's 2003 interview with Michael Jackson (MARK SMITH/AFP/Getty Images) But Bradley knew what the interview required. Not softballs or promises that it wouldn't be a ""gotcha"" interview, but a tough grilling on a serious subject, which is exactly what he did. Consider how Bradley refused to merely ""shine a light"" on Jackson, or to simply ""ask about some of the controversy."" Bradley presses and presses Jackson and produces a revealing moment of, you know, journalism: ED BRADLEY: Do you know how this looks to a lot of people? I mean, do you understand that? MICHAEL JACKSON: How does what look? ED BRADLEY: How the fact that you — MICHAEL JACKSON: Know why? People think sex. They're thinking sex. My mind doesn't run that way. When I see children, I see the face of God. That's why I love them so much. That's what I see. ED BRADLEY: Do you know any other man your age, a 45-year-old man, who shares his bedroom with children? MICHAEL JACKSON: Of course. Not for sex. No. That's wrong. ED BRADLEY: Well, let me — let me say, from my perspective, my experience, I don't know any 45-year-old men, who are not relatives of the children, who share their bedroom with other children. What Megyn Kelly appears to have done--based, again, only on what Alex Jones has released--is to have reassured Jones that any difficult questions would be easy to skate right past. Telling someone hey, I'm going to ask about the controversial stuff and you can answer is reporter speak for, we’re going to go through the motions here, but fear not, I won’t follow up, surprise you, or make you sweat. We’ll do the “tough questions” but we'll do it quick and get on to other things. Any reporter will recognize the subtext of what Kelly was promising, and, for anyone who knows what kind of creature Alex Jones is, and knows what he has meant to the Sandy Hook families, it will be a nauseating moment of clarity about NBC's newest star. She went so far as to dismiss criticism of Jones as ""this insane version of you in [people's] heads."" That's puzzling, since earlier this week Kelly said in a statement, “I find Alex Jones’s suggestion that Sandy Hook was ‘a hoax’ as personally revolting as every other rational person does.” Well, if that's true, then what, exactly, is the ""insane"" version of Jones people have in their heads? Was Kelly blowing smoke, and if so, when? Was she spinning Jones, or the families who expressed disgust that she planned to profile him? Watch On Forbes: It seems clear this was never intended to be journalism. It was just meant to be promotable TV, and the mission wasn't ""shining a light"" on anything other than Megyn Kelly's new show. Kelly even hints to Jones that she wouldn’t hit him too hard because she wouldn't want to scare away future guests. “The next time I want to get somebody, they're going to say, ‘Look what you did to Alex Jones,’...it's not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.” This is awful. It’s beyond bad for journalists at NBC News who felt deeply for the Sandy Hook parents, but also believed that censoring Jones runs counter to getting out the truth. Now they know that they defended their colleague’s right to do an interview that was never actually intended to do anything other than normalize Alex Jones, the guy who loves those kids and is more complex than I’ve been led to believe. This was the work of a TV star using her bona fides as a former Fox News host to convince a far-right extremist to come on her new show. Not to inform, but to entertain. No matter what airs Sunday night, Megyn Kelly is damaging the NBC News brand, and weakening her position inside the network. And any effort to beef up the Alex Jones piece before it airs will look like late-innings weak sauce. The truth is, the Sandy Hook families were played--not by Jones this time, but Kelly, who promised to be a journalist as she was privately promising Jones he had nothing to worry about. How could NBC not have known its new star was taking a hated man and somehow turning him into the subject of a cozy and warm Father's Day profile? Did NBC think the Sandy Hook families would see a different side of the man who has added to their pain? Or didn't anybody care what they would think? Fans of Michael Jackson and the families of his accusers could watch Ed Bradley's story for 60 Minutes and walk away calling it fair. But here? Megyn Kelly said she hoped critics of Jones would walk away from her story saying ""wow, that was really interesting."" What, exactly, would they find interesting? Jones’ mockery of not just the death of schoolchildren, but the grieving of their parents? If not that, what, then? How much fun Jones is to hang out with? Andy Lack, this is bad. Megyn Kelly clearly has talent, but uprooted from the environment where Fox News and Roger Ailes carefully cultivated her career, Kelly’s true talents remain unexplored. If it’s not investigative journalism, then what is Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly intended to be? A newsy profile show bringing on the most extreme voices of hate so that we can ""shine a light"" on their hobbies, tour their homes and see them make smiley-face pancakes for their kids? Cancel the show. Let Kelly focus on her yet-to-launch daytime show. But beware, that's very, very valuable territory for NBC, and nobody wants to add controversy or conflict anywhere near Today as it fights for every tenth of a ratings point with ABC's Good Morning America. There will be little tolerance for anyone who threatens to damage NBC's morning franchise, which has been rocked plenty in recent years but is currently sailing in smooth(ish) waters. MSNBC, perhaps?

346,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/america-gun-laws-pew-study,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.16 BST More than half of Americans want stricter gun laws, while still preserving the rights of most people in most places to carry most types of guns, a Pew Research Center survey has found.  While half of Americans see gun violence as a very big problem in their country, fewer than 10% of American adults said that “almost no one” should be able to legally own a gun, and only 10% said that “almost no types” of guns should be legally available to buy. Overall, however, 52% want stricter gun laws. In other countries, last week’s mass shooting on members of Congress that left House majority whip Steve Scalise seriously wounded might have started a debate over stricter gun control laws. In America, the response was different: the leading gun rights organization agreed to train members of Congress and their staff on how to use guns in self-defense. The National Rifle Association announced on Wednesday that it had agreed to offer firearms training courses to members of Congress “regardless of political affiliation”. But the new survey suggests that there are stark partisan differences in how Democratic and Republican gun owners use their firearms – as well as in their openness to new gun laws. The Pew survey of nearly 4,000 American adults found some areas of agreement. Strong majorities of gun owners and non-gun owners support background checks for private sales and sales at gun shows, as well as barring those on terror watchlists from buying guns – two federal policies Republicans in Congress have rejected. Even among gun owners, though, the survey found clear differences in firearm usage. Republican gun owners reported shooting or going to a gun range more often than Democratic gun owners did. And 55% of Democrats who reported owning a handgun said they never carry their gun with them. By contrast, the majority of Republican gun owners said they carry their handgun with them at least part of the time. About 25% of Democrats reported owning a gun or living in a household with a gun, compared with 57% of Republicans. Views on what guns mean, and what gun laws the country needs, were also markedly different based on party affiliation. Nine out of 10 Republican gun owners said the right to own firearms is essential to their sense of freedom, compared with only four in 10 Democratic gun owners. More than 80% of gun owners who are Republican or lean Republican support allowing teachers or officials to carry guns in primary and secondary schools, compared with only 42% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning gun owners. Two-thirds of Democratic and Democratic-leaning gun owners support banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, compared with only about one-third of Republican and Republican-leaning gun owners. Nearly half of Republican and Republican-leaning gun owners support allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit, while 85% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning gun owners oppose this. There is a larger partisan gap between Democrats and Republicans on views of the NRA than there is between gun owners and non-gun owners. The survey suggested Americans’ relationship with guns is entrenched: most gun owners cannot imagine ever not owning a gun, and even the majority of those who don’t currently own a gun say they could see themselves owning a gun in the future. More than 70% of Americans say they have fired a gun at some point in their lives. And more than 90% see guns as playing some role in American culture. While they express strong support for gun ownership among at least some people, and gun carrying in at least some places, a large number of Americans have seen those around them directly affected by gun violence. About a quarter of Americans said they or their families have been threatened or intimidated with a gun. More than 40% of Americans say they personally know someone who has been shot, whether intentionally or accidentally. Among black adults, the proportion rises to 57%. By contrast, only 17% of current gun owners – and 7% of Americans overall – said they had personally used a gun to defend themselves, their families, or their property. The new Pew survey found a slightly higher percentage of Americans who said they own guns – about 30% – than some other estimates. But the survey found similar overall demographic trends in gun ownership, with about half of white men saying they owned a gun, compared with about a quarter of white women and non-white men, and 16% of non-white women. The NRA has strong support among gun owners overall, but a sizable minority of gun owners expressed disapproval of the NRA’s political power. Nearly one in three gun owners said the group has too much power over American gun laws. Half of Americans who are not gun owners agreed.NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said she did not immediately have more details on the firearms training sessions for members of Congress.",2017-06-22 16:13:58,"More than half of Americans want stricter gun laws, Pew study finds",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

348,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/16/mass-shooting-tv-episodes,"In the wake of Wednesday’s shootings, NBC postponed a Carmichael Show episode that dealt with gun violence. Its creator said that decision fails to acknowledge the realities of the problem Last modified on Mon 23 Apr 2018 10.35 BST In an interview with Chelsea Handler, Jerrod Carmichael, the star of NBC’s The Carmichael Show, had some choice words for the network, which pulled an episode of his show that dealt with a mass shooting on the heels of attacks in Alexandria, Virginia, and San Francisco on Wednesday. The episode, called Shoot-Up-Able, was originally slated to air the same night. “I thought that tonight’s episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way,” he told Handler on her Netflix talk-show Chelsea. “It really lends itself to conversation. When things like this happen, and someone wants to talk about in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say ‘too soon’. But when is it not too soon? These things happen constantly.”  Carmichael told Handler he thought NBC’s decision proved they “don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue that reflects real family conversations and feels honest and true”. He continued: “We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we possibly could. But to pull that is criminal. It seems to do a disservice to the viewers. It does a disservice to all of us.” It’s not the first time an episode of television has been deemed inappropriately timed by the corporate powers that be. In 2015, the season one finale of the USA Network’s Mr Robot was delayed because of the Bridgewater Plaza shooting earlier that day; and Shooter, a sniper-themed action series from that same network, was significantly postponed following the 2016 attack on five Dallas police officers. Similarly, NBC pulled a 2013 episode of Hannibal featuring child deaths that was set to run a few months after the Sandy Hook massacre, and when, that same year, an episode of Glee was premised on a school shooting, it was criticized by parents of the victims who felt they should’ve been warned about its content. Hannibal writer Bryan Fuller said at the time that he agreed with the decision, having worried that “associations that came with the subject matter … would inhibit the enjoyment of the overall episode”. When postponing the Mr Robot season finale, USA Network said the delay was “out of respect to the victims, their families and colleagues, and our viewers”. Carmichael’s frustrations with the network’s decision seem equally valid, reflective of the tendency of contemporary television shows to cast a thoughtful, substantive light on difficult issues such as gun violence, race relations and sexual assault. And yet, as evidenced by NBC’s choice to delay the episode, television networks seem to have collectively decided that fictitious representations of traumatizing incidents such as these ought to be shelved, at least temporarily, until enough time has passed. One could argue, as Carmichael seems to be doing, that an episode like Shoot-Up-Able would have greater impact if seen immediately after a tragedy, jolting us out of our shock and into a more serious consideration of its themes. “The episode itself is about the character, Jerrod, surviving a mass shooting and coming to the realization that although he wasn’t physically harmed, he is still very much a victim,” Carmichael explained to Handler. “We’re all victims when something like this happens.” There have already been over 150 mass shootings and nearly 7,000 gun-related deaths in 2017, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Pervasive anxiety about public safety, as Carmichael suggested, has risen in proportion. And in facing these sad realities, perhaps TV networks can better position themselves for the occasionally ill-timed episode by understanding that, to the contrary, they’re not ill-timed at all, but rather crucial contributions to public discourse that are meant to make us think about the terrifying frequency with which these events occur. The advent of streaming services, where showrunners exercise a level of creative autonomy not granted by network TV, seems to have circumvented the problem altogether, allowing audiences to consume entertainment on their own schedules. The finale of the Netflix series The OA, for instance, had a dramatization of a school shooting. While it generally wasn’t well-received, criticized as “problematic” and “disrespectful” in a number of reviews, the episode did manage to avoid getting thwarted by the politics of network television. But as the country finds itself further divided by and enmeshed in hyper-partisan tensions, television, and art writ large, has become a sort of Rorschach test, policed through the prism of the day’s newsreel. NBC’s decision reaffirms the precedent set in previous instances, where networks opted to delay or reconsider episodes that might’ve been especially triggering or, as Carmichael said, “too soon.” But that same precedent assumes there’s nothing we can learn from art, that airing an episode about gun violence in the wake of gun violence itself is superfluous or distracting. It might be time to reevaluate those assumptions.",2017-06-16 13:34:07,'When is it not too soon?' Should mass shooting TV episodes be pulled?,television,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
349,https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2017/06/16/megyn-kelly-reportedly-completely-overhauled-her-interview-with-alex-jones,"By Kevin Slane   A new report claims that NBC host Megyn Kelly has “completely overhauled” her interview with Infowars founder and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. According to Page Six, Kelly reached out to relatives of victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, to appear on-camera to rebut Jones, who as recently as 2015 said that he believes that the shooting was a government hoax that used child actors. The Page Six report follows days of tense discussion after Kelly first released a teaser for the Jones interview this past Sunday. The interview drew harsh criticism from many, including the parents of Sandy Hook victims. Sandy Hook Promise, a gun violence prevention nonprofit created after the mass shooting, announced Monday that they had asked Kelly to step down as host of their annual Promise Champion Gala in light of the interview.   “NBC was scrambling to find a way out of this mess without having to back down and cancel Sunday’s episode of Megyn’s show,” a source told Page Six. “Megyn and her producers made numerous calls to the Sandy Hook families this week to ask them to appear on the show. Some refused because they didn’t think appearing on her show would do enough to counter Alex Jones’ venom.” Nelba Márquez-Greene, whose daughter Ana was killed in the shooting and who roundly criticized Kelly after the teaser was released, confirmed in a series of tweets at least some of what Page Six reported. But Márquez-Greene also said Kelly was “not contrite” when she spoke with her, and that the Page Six article was “damage control” by Kelly and NBC.   “This is a damage control article, riddled with partial truth, based on conversations that were supposed to be confidential. #truth,” Márquez-Greene tweeted Thursday in response to the article. “For the record: she was not contrite,” Márquez-Greene said of her conversation with Kelly in another tweet. “Quite the opposite. So sad to see lying on top bad judgement.” Multiple outlets also reported Thursday that attorneys representing several relatives of Sandy Hook victims sent NBC a letter urging them not to air the interview. “Airing Ms. Kelly’s interview implicitly endorses the notion that Mr. Jones’ lies are actually ‘claims’ that are worthy of serious debate; and in doing so it exponentially enhances the suffering and distress of our clients. For that NBC is responsible,” wrote attorneys Josh Koskoff and Katie Mesner-Hage, per Variety. “We urge you to consider the ethical and legal ramifications of broadcasting this interview to millions of Americans. By now, it should be clear to NBC that airing the interview will cause serious emotional distress to dozens of Sandy Hook families. NBC – and NBC alone – has the power to prevent that harm.”   Furthermore, Jones released a video early Friday morning of what he claims is secretly recorded audio of Kelly’s conversations with him. In the video, Kelly says that she “saw a different side of” Jones in the wake of his highly publicized custody case and promised Jones that the interview was “not going to be a contentious, sort of ‘gotcha’ exchange.” Jones said in a video released Monday night that he doesn’t want the interview to air, either. “I agree with the families of the victims of Sandy Hook,” Jones said in the video. “The Alex Jones profile interview with Megyn Kelly does not need to air, it needs to be shelved.”   Kelly’s interview with Jones is scheduled to air this Sunday, June 18, during Kelly’s new show, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. DETROIT – In the wake of Britain's third major attack in three months, Prime Minister Theresa May called on governments to form international agreements to prevent the spread of extremism online. Here's a look at extremism on the web, what's being done to stop it and what could come next. Q. What are technology companies doing to make sure extremist videos and other terrorist content doesn't spread across the internet? A. Internet companies use technology plus teams of human reviewers to flag and remove posts from people who engage in extremist activity or express support for terrorism. Google, for example, says it employs thousands of people to fight abuse on its platforms. Google's YouTube service removes any video that has hateful content or incites violence, and its software prevents the video from ever being reposted. YouTube says it removed 92 million videos in 2015; 1 percent were removed for terrorism or hate speech violations. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter teamed up late last year to create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints for images and videos that are produced by or support extremist organizations. Those fingerprints help the companies identify and remove extremist content. After the attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March, tech companies also agreed to form a joint group to accelerate anti-terrorism efforts. Twitter says in the last six months of 2016, it suspended a total of 376,890 accounts for violations related to the promotion of extremism. Three-quarters of those were found through Twitter's internal tools; just 2 percent were taken down because of government requests, the company says. Facebook says it alerts law enforcement if it sees a threat of an imminent attack or harm to someone. It also seeks out potential extremist accounts by tracing the ""friends"" of an account that has been removed for terrorism. Q. Why are technology companies clashing with governments over extremist communications? A. Since Edward Snowden's 2013 disclosures about National Security Agency surveillance, several tech companies have started encrypting — that is, scrambling them to thwart spies — instant messages and other data so tightly that even the companies can't read them. Governments are not happy about that. After the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, and again after the Westminster Bridge attack, the U.S. and U.K. governments sought access to encrypted messages exchanged by extremists who carried out the attacks. Apple and Facebook's WhatsApp refused, noting that they didn't hold the keys needed to unscramble such messages. Both governments eventually found other ways to get the information they wanted. Some in government — including former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California — have argued that the inability to access encrypted data is a threat to security. Feinstein has introduced a bill to force companies to give the government so-called ""backdoor"" access to encrypted data so that investigators could read messages on these services. Q. Shouldn't tech companies be forced to share encrypted information if it could protect national security? A. Weakening encryption won't make people safer, says Richard Forno, who directs the graduate cybersecurity program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Terrorists will simply take their communications deeper underground by developing their own cyber channels or even reverting to paper notes sent by couriers, he said. ""It's playing whack-a-mole,"" he said. ""The bad guys are not constrained by the law. That's why they're bad guys."" Building backdoors into encryption could also weaken it in ways that hackers, criminals and foreign agents could exploit. That could potentially jeopardize all sorts of vital data, from personal communications and documents to bank accounts, credit card transactions, medical history and other information that people want to keep private. But Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business at the University of Michigan, says society has sometimes determined that the government can intrude in ways it might not normally, as in times of war. He says laws may eventually be passed requiring companies to share encrypted data if police obtain a warrant from a judge. ""If we get to the point where we say, 'Privacy is not as important as staying alive,' I think there will be some setup which will allow the government to breach privacy,"" he said. Q. Is it really the tech companies' job to police the internet and remove content? A. Tech companies have accepted that this is part of their mission. In a Facebook post earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was developing artificial intelligence so its computers can tell the difference between news stories about terrorism and terrorist propaganda. ""This is technically difficult as it requires building AI that can read and understand news, but we need to work on this to help fight terrorism worldwide,"" Zuckerberg said. But Gordon says internet companies may not go far enough, since they need users in order to sell ads. ""Think of the hateful stuff that is said. How do you draw the line? And where the line gets drawn determines how much money they make,"" he said. Others say the focus on tech companies and their responsibilities is misplaced. Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, says blaming Facebook or Google for the spread of terrorism is like blaming the mail system or the phone company for Irish Republican Army violence 30 years ago. Instead of working together to censor the internet, Anderson says, governments and companies should work together to share information more quickly. Former Secretary of State John Kerry also worries about placing too much blame on the internet instead of the underlying causes of violence. ""The bottom line is that in too many places, in too many parts of the world, you've got a large gap between governance and people and between the opportunities those people have,"" Kerry said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Secret taping is a powerful tool for journalists. But is it legal? In Texas, where Jones taped Kelly, the answer is yes. “Under Texas law, Alex Jones was within his rights to secretly record his conversation with Megyn Kelly,” said lawyer Laura Lee Prather of the law firm Haynes and Boone in Austin, Texas. Also Read: Alex Jones Leaks Audio of Megyn Kelly Interview Before Sunday Broadcast Also Read: Alex Jones Leaks Audio of Megyn Kelly Interview Before Sunday Broadcast “The law simply requires one party to the conversation to be aware it is being recorded, and, in this instance, that party was Mr. Jones,” Prather told TheWrap. If the phone call was conducted with Kelly in New York and Jones in Texas, the secret taping would still be legal because New York also allows secret taping by one party to a call. But in other states such as California, secret taping of phone conversations is illegal unless all the people in the conversation approve of the taping. Two antiabortion activists were criminally charged in March for secretly taping their conversations with workers at Planned Parenthood office in California, where violating the law is a felony.

Jones said he quietly taped Kelly because he believes the interview to be aired Sunday would misrepresent his views on the mass shooting at an elementary school in Sandy Hook and he doesn’t want NBC to air the interview.

But I knew that it was a fraud, I knew it was a lie.” He continued, “God, she was like, ‘I want to get steaks with you, I’m obsessed with you. Oh, my God,’ wailing around in her seat.

The recent backlash against Megyn Kelly and NBC for interviewing Alex Jones has renewed the spotlight on the host of conservative show ""Info Wars."" Kelly said in a statement Tuesday that she wanted to interview Jones because of his ties with President Donald Trump. Here's a breakdown of their relationship. 
Various





Trump and Jones began a relationship on Trump's campaign trail, and have peddled some of the same conspiracy theories, according to Mother Jones. Perhaps Trump's most popular conspiracy theory is that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States (he was), a theory also perpetuated by Jones. 
NBC





In December 2015, Trump was a guest on Jones' show. Jones introduced Trump as ""a maverick"" who ""tells it like it is."" Jones opened the show by praising Trump for taking attacks from media outlets like the Washington Post and the New York Post. Jones theorizes that the attacks on 9/11 were a hoax; it was surprising that a Republican candidate would go on a show whose host postures that the previous Republican president was part of such an elaborate hoax.

At a January 2016 campaign event, Trump called Jones ""a nice guy.""

In February 2016, senior policy advisor to Trump Stephen Miller appeared on ""Info Wars,"" and repeatedly spoke to Jones' audience asking for support. ""If you want to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you want to close the border, if you want to protect American jobs and wages, then you have to support Donald J. Trump,"" Miller said.

""Hillary for prison"" became the rallying cry at the 2016 Republican National Convention. The phrase was initially found on merchandise on the ""Info Wars"" website. Jones was a ""special guest"" at the convention.

Trump continued to parrot Jones' ideas. Last August, Jones said, ""It is surreal to talk about issues here on air, and then word-for-word hear Trump say it two days later.""

Also last August, Jones said on his show that he personally talked to Trump and encouraged him to push the idea that the election would be rigged. Trump did end up pushing this idea. ""I'm afraid the election's going to be rigged. I have to be honest,"" Trump said at an Ohio campaign stop.

In November 2016, Trump's advisor Roger Stone told the Washington Post that Jones would be a ""valuable asset"" to Trump.

After the election, Jones said in an ""Info Wars"" video that Trump called him to thank him. ""I wanted to talk to you to thank your audience,"" Jones said the then-president-elect told him.

Even Hillary Clinton weighed in on Trump's reliance on Jones for ideas throughout the campaign, and released an attack ad featuring Jones. ""This is what Trump listens to,"" says the ad as Jones talks about chemicals put in the water to make people gay.

Jones' website is full of references to ""presstitutes,"" and discredits news organizations like NPR and CNN. Trump is known for discrediting several news organizations. For example, in February he called the media ""the enemy.""

352,http://www.thewrap.com/stars-slammed-for-silence-on-orlando-shooting/,"“Why is it OK to tweet something about National Yoga Day but not about this?” prominent gay activist tells TheWrap Graphic: Eric Hernandez Some gay activists feel slighted by stars who offered their love and support on Twitter after mass killings in Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Paris and Brussels — but not after the Orlando shooting. “Silence speaks volumes,” gay advocate Danielle Moodie-Mills, who consulted for GLAAD, told TheWrap. “Why is it OK to tweet something about National Yoga Day but not about this?” Blogger Perez Hilton named names, calling out celebrities like Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Drake — none of whom responded fast enough, he says. The issue is whether stars were less demonstrative with their support because the victims were LGBT. Also Read: LA Gay Pride Parade Attendees Undeterred After Orlando Massacre Also Read: LA Gay Pride Parade Attendees Undeterred After Orlando Massacre “F–k that bullshit!” Hilton said during a recent podcast. “I am judging them.” Many find it distasteful to make an issue of celebrity tweets as the country fights over gun control and mourns the loss of 49 people killed by Omar Mateen. Asked about criticism that Rihanna has tweeted about her upcoming tour, but has yet to mention the Orlando shooting on any of her social media platforms, a publicist for the star told TheWrap: “I am honestly hoping that you’re NOT trying to take this tragedy and write a story about how Rihanna hasn’t tweeted‎ about it. I’m honestly going to pretend you didn’t write this email.” And AIDS activist Peter Staley, who was featured in the 2012 Oscar-nominated documentary “How to Survive a Plague,” told TheWrap he has bigger things to worry about than what stars say online. “I don’t really follow the celebrity world. it’s not my thing,” he said. “The activism that has been pouring out since the massacre has been substantial and real, and I’m not sure I care that much what various celebrities tweet or don’t tweet.” But tweets matter, says Chad Kawalec, a social media marketing expert and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brand Identity Center. “Anyone wondering if celebrities really wield any true influence should ask why major brands continuously pay them upwards of $10,000 for a single tweet,” Kawalec told TheWrap. “Their millions of fans ‘follow’ them — both literally and figuratively.They are referred to as ‘influencers’ in the marketing world for a reason.” Kawalec, who is gay, said he didn’t understand why someone wouldn’t tweet messages of Orlando support. “I don’t mean this as a dig, but it’s hard to justify saying nothing when it costs nothing to say something,” he said. Hilton said in an email to TheWrap: “It was glaring as the days went on who DIDN’T say something. I think EVERYONE — celebrity or civilian — has a responsibility to speak on events that shift the cultural landscape in such a massive and awful way, like the tragedy in Orlando. ESPECIALLY if you’re a celebrity who is often on social media and even more often trying to promote themselves and their products. If you don’t speak out, you’re siding with the culprits! Silence is deafening! Sadly, a lot of celebrities are cowards. But, what happened last week is not about politics or sexuality. It’s about humanity! And not speaking on it shows a great lack of humanity.” In some cases, stars who were silent on Orlando nonetheless tweeted about their products and projects. Adding to the activists’ frustration is that so many celebrities who didn’t comment on Orlando did express support after previous mass killings. For example, when gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November, killing 130 people, Hollywood’s biggest names took to social media to show their solidarity and send their prayers to the French capital. Swift posted a picture of herself standing on a bridge with the caption: “Praying for Paris. Our hearts are breaking for and with you.” The Instagram post got more than 2 million likes and 24,000 comments. Drake posted a picture of the Eiffel Tower to his more than 22 million followers. And Justin Beiber posted a heartfelt message to his more than 80 million Twitter fans, saying, “Thoughts and prayers with everyone #PrayForParis.” Rihanna also tweeted her support to the victims of the Brussels bombing, telling her more than 60 million fans, “Praying for all those who’ve been affected by acts of terror across the globe, most recent being in Brussels… Heart breaking!” But none of the above stars spoke out about Orlando immediately after the shooting. When Swift eventually did offer support, the Huffington Post noted that she honored Orlando “after nearly a week of silence.” Bieber tweeted about Orlando four days following the attack — only after Perez Hilton and fans complained about his lack of a response.  For all those asking no I won't cancel the Orlando show. I stand with Orlando in support. Love you Orlando! #OrlandoStrong — Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) June 16, 2016  Also Read: Orlando Victims GoFundMe Raises Over $2.7 Million on First Day Also Read: Orlando Victims GoFundMe Raises Over $2.7 Million on First Day Minaj was slammed for dropping a new track while ignoring the massacre, and a fan accused her of blocking him after he complained about it. (Reps for Minaj and Drake did not respond to TheWrap’s requests for comment). Some activists say they don’t want to nit-pick who tweets what, but do want those with great platforms to use them for good. “There are two things that move society: pop culture and politics,” said Moodie-Mills. “And pop culture can reach people in a way that politics can’t. When a star says, ‘This is important to me,’ it matters.” Also Read: Orlando Nightclub Shooting Kills 49, Injures 53 (Updating) Also Read: Orlando Nightclub Shooting Kills 49, Injures 53 (Updating) “Celebrities can reach more people with one tweet than some major publications,” said Anthony Shop, co-founder of Social Driver, a digital and social media strategy agency. Many Hollywood celebrities responded to Orlando quickly and wholeheartedly. Bette Midler tweeted no less than 23 messages related to Orlando and changed her cover picture to a rainbow flag. Lady Gaga followed her tweets with a heartfelt speech demanding justice for LGBT people. Beyonce closed the first leg of her “Formation World Tour” by dedicating her hit song, “Halo,” to the Orlando victims. And Broadway’s biggest names sang, “What The World Needs Now Is Love,” in honor of the victims. The performers included Whoopi Goldberg, Kristen Bell, Matthew Broderick, Gloria Estefan, Idina Menzel, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Rosie O’Donnell and Sarah Jessica Parker. Also Read: Presidential Candidates, Hollywood 'Devastated' by Orlando Nightclub Mass Shooting Also Read: Presidential Candidates, Hollywood 'Devastated' by Orlando Nightclub Mass Shooting “The entertainment community is always the first to jump behind the LGBT community,” publicist Simon Halls told TheWrap. “It’s tricky and dangerous to judge people based on their Twitter feed.” One reason the issue is so difficult, says prominent gay activist Cleve Jones, is that the Orlando shooting “didn’t fit into a simple convenient narrative.” It isn’t about one issue, but rather a perfect storm of many extremely complex ones. The growing list of issues the Orlando attack evokes includes homophobia, race, terrorism, gun control and mental illness. Some celebrities may be understandably hesitant to stake out positions that may change as more facts emerge. The issues are so sensitive that even one celebrity who tried to show support for victims was criticized. After Nick Jonas turned up at a New York City vigil for the Orlando victims, a gay Huffington Post writer said he seemed a little too eager in an article titled: “Dear Nick Jonas, There’s a Way To Be A Straight Ally. That Wasn’t It.” The article criticized the singer for taking “up space” and infringing on the gay community’s moment of grief. Many readers disagreed with it. Kawalec says social media teams that work for A-list stars will have to take a hard look at their practices after Orlando. The first lesson is not to try to move units during a national tragedy. “Whenever there was any kind of negative world event, we immediately stopped any advertising for any of our major brands,” Kawalec said. “The last thing you want is to seem like you’re still busy trying to make a buck while people are crying.” Rasha Ali and Michael Monaghan contributed to this report. 11 Hollywood Stars in the NRA: From Chuck Norris to James Earl Jones (Photos)






The National Rifle Association has stood up for gun owners for years, but come under heavy criticism for opposing gun control after mass shootings from San Bernardino to Orlando. Some celebrity members of the group have stood by it, while others have distanced themselves from certain stances.






Arguably the most famous Hollywood star associated with the NRA was Charlton Heston, who served as its president from 1998 to 2003 before stepping down after an Alzheimers diagnosis. (He died in April 2008.)
Universal





Rock musician Ted Nugent is one of the NRA's most outspoken members. In January 2015, on the organization's radio show, he called NRA opponents ""subhuman mongrels"" and ""some kind of inbred Martian.""

NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone is an avid hunter and has served on the NRA Board. But he angered some gun owners when he spoke to Sports Illustrated about those who buy guns for their protection: ""The big picture is that guns won't protect you. If someone really wanted to get you, they would.""






""Walker, Texas Ranger"" star Chuck Norris has a long history as an avid NRA spokesperson, creating videos supporting the Second Amendment and NRA initiatives including the ""Trigger The Vote"" campaign.






Actor Tom Selleck got into a heated debate with Rosie O'Donnell in 1999 when she questioned him about being a member of the NRA. In 2013, shortly after the Sandy Hook school shootings, MSNBC pundit Lawrence O'Donnell said that it was time to ""question Selleck's humanity"" after the actor's silence on the matter.






In 2014, an online petition circulated demanding the Glastonbury music festival remove Metallica from the schedule because its frontman, James Hetfield, is an NRA member with a history of hunting. Hetfield narrated the History Channel series ""The Hunt,"" about a trek to Kodiak, Alaska, to kill brown bears. When it comes to gun control, however, Hetfield said in 2013: ""I don’t want to make it easier for someone to have an assault weapon, but I also want to be able to protect my family.""

In 2012, Whoopi Goldberg revealed on ""The View"" that she is a member of the NRA during an interview with libertarian writer and TV pundit John Stossel. ""I don’t mind having to register and let them know that I have them,"" Goldberg said. ""I want to know that there’s at least some way to prevent folks who are just getting out from mental institutions [from getting guns].”

View In Gallery The National Rifle Association has stood up for gun owners for years, but come under heavy criticism for opposing gun control after mass shootings from San Bernardino to Orlando. Some celebrity members of the group have stood by it, while others have distanced themselves from certain stances. Arguably the most famous Hollywood star associated with the NRA was Charlton Heston, who served as its president from 1998 to 2003 before stepping down after an Alzheimers diagnosis. (He died in April 2008.) Rock musician Ted Nugent is one of the NRA's most outspoken members. In January 2015, on the organization's radio show, he called NRA opponents ""subhuman mongrels"" and ""some kind of inbred Martian."" NBA Hall of Famer Karl Malone is an avid hunter and has served on the NRA Board. But he angered some gun owners when he spoke to Sports Illustrated about those who buy guns for their protection: ""The big picture is that guns won't protect you. If someone really wanted to get you, they would."" ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" star Chuck Norris has a long history as an avid NRA spokesperson, creating videos supporting the Second Amendment and NRA initiatives including the ""Trigger The Vote"" campaign. Actor Tom Selleck got into a heated debate with Rosie O'Donnell in 1999 when she questioned him about being a member of the NRA. In 2013, shortly after the Sandy Hook school shootings, MSNBC pundit Lawrence O'Donnell said that it was time to ""question Selleck's humanity"" after the actor's silence on the matter. In 2014, an online petition circulated demanding the Glastonbury music festival remove Metallica from the schedule because its frontman, James Hetfield, is an NRA member with a history of hunting. Hetfield narrated the History Channel series ""The Hunt,"" about a trek to Kodiak, Alaska, to kill brown bears. When it comes to gun control, however, Hetfield said in 2013: ""I don’t want to make it easier for someone to have an assault weapon, but I also want to be able to protect my family."" In 2012, Whoopi Goldberg revealed on ""The View"" that she is a member of the NRA during an interview with libertarian writer and TV pundit John Stossel. ""I don’t mind having to register and let them know that I have them,"" Goldberg said. ""I want to know that there’s at least some way to prevent folks who are just getting out from mental institutions [from getting guns].” James Earl Jones wrote about being a NRA member in his 1993 self-titled autobiography: ""I just throw the political mail from the NRA into the trash ...

	Rebecca Rubin Film and Media Reporter Jerrod Carmichael wants to have a discussion about the sensitivity of gun violence. On an episode of Netflix’s “Chelsea,” Carmichael criticized NBC for pulling an episode of “The Carmichael Show” because it involved a mass shooting. It’s common for networks to not air episodes of shows that reflect real-life incidents like a shooting or plane crash if they are scheduled to air within a few days of the tragedy. The episode would have been broadcast on Wednesday night — the same day that Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives, was shot, along with three others, by a lone gunman in Alexandria, Va., while practicing for a congressional baseball game. Carmichael said he hoped the episode, in which his character survives a mass shooting, would foster meaningful discourse about such tragedies.  “A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say, ‘Too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately these things happen constantly, and it’s a thing that breaks all of our hearts,” he said. He said he understands NBC’s decision, but doesn’t agree with it. “Really to me, what it says is that you don’t think that America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims,” he said. The sensitive episode still showed love and integrity, an emotional Carmichael said. “To just pull that is just, it’s criminal,” he said. “It seems to do a disservice to the viewer, it does a disservice to you, it does a disservice to all of us.” Host Chelsea Handler agreed. “Well I’m glad you’re f—ing saying it. You’re right, you’re absolutely right,” she said. NBC declined to comment on Carmichael’s remarks.

354,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/27/sarah-palin-suing-new-york-times-for-defamation/,"Getty Images Sarah Palin is suing The New York Times for defamation, according to documents filed in federal court Tuesday that were obtained by The Daily Caller. The lawsuit has to do with an editorial the NYT ran on June 14 that falsely smeared Palin as inciting the 2011 shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords by a mentally ill man. There is no evidence to support the NYT’s implication that Palin played a role in inciting the Giffords shooting. (RELATED: NYT Uses GOP Shooting To Falsely Attack Sarah Palin With Debunked Conspiracy Theory) “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for defaming her by publishing a statement about her that it knew to be false: that Mrs. Palin was responsible for inciting a mass shooting at a political event in January 2011,” Palin’s suit states. “Specifically, on June 14, 2017, The Times Editorial Board, which represents the ‘voice’ of The Times, falsely stated as a matter of fact to millions of people that Mrs. Palin incited Jared Loughner’s January 8, 2011, shooting rampage at a political event in Tucson, Arizona, during which he shot nineteen people, severely wounding United States Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, and killing six, including Chief U.S. District Court Judge John Roll and a nine-year-old girl.” The lawsuit states that the paper “published and promoted its Editorial Board’s column despite knowing that the linchpin of its ‘sickening pattern’ of politically-incited shootings was the false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited Loughner to murder six people, among them a child and federal judge, and seriously wound numerous others.” (RELATED: NYT Has Been Pushing Palin-Giffords Falsehood For Years) It goes on to state: “As the public backlash over The Times’ malicious column mounted, it responded by making edits and ‘corrections’ to its fabricated story, along with half-hearted Twitter apologies–none of which sufficiently corrected the falsehoods that the paper published. In fact, none mentioned Mrs. Palin or acknowledged that Mrs. Palin did not incite a deranged man to commit murder.” Palin claims the editorial “exceeded the bounds of legality, decency and civility by publishing the false and defamatory column.” She is seeking a minimum of $75,000 in damages. The full lawsuit can be seen below. Sarah Palin sues the New York Times for defamation by Peter Hasson on Scribd  In the NYT’s editorial, which has since been updated, the editors claimed there was a “clear” link to incitement between Jared Loughner’s attempted assassination of Giffords, and a map Palin had created that placed crosshairs over districts that Republicans needed to flip in the 2012 election. No such link exists. [dcquiz] CNN’s Jake Tapper pointed out in response to the NYT editorial that “even way back in Jan 2011 we knew that Loughlin’s obsession began 3 years before the Palin map.” Tapper made that same exact point back in 2011 when he worked for ABC. After harsh criticism in the media, the NYT finally added a correction that read: “An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established.” The NYT editorial followed the attempted mass assassination of Republican lawmakers by a left-wing Bernie Sanders supporter, who espoused anti-Republican rhetoric on his Facebook page and belonged to several anti-GOP groups on Facebook, including one titled, “Terminate The Republican Party.” The Daily Caller is awaiting comment from the NYT.

355,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/358929124/0/phoenix/nation~A-year-after-Orlando-Pulse-nightclub-shooting-were-going-backward-on-guns/,"Since June 12, 2016, the hometown that I love, Orlando, has had to bear the unfortunate title of home to the Nation’s deadliest mass shooting. An Islamic State-inspired shooter went into a LGBTQ night club on “Latin Night” where people were gathering for what my bishop likes to call a late-night fellowship, and opened fire. The people in the club didn’t stand a chance against the man with an assault rifle and a handgun. In a matter of minutes the gunman was able to kill 49 people and wound many others, plus shatter lives and leave a scar on our community and our hearts forever. I served in law-enforcement for 27 years, four years of that as the Chief of Police for the Orlando Police Department. Before being elected to Congress I spent most of my adult life wearing a uniform, a badge and carrying a gun. I took an oath to protect the innocent from dangerous people. Many say guns don’t kill, but guns in the wrong hands do. As a law enforcement officer, I have seen more young victims of gun violence than I care to admit. I have also seen too many mothers, fathers and children who had to receive the bad news about their loved ones in the middle of the night. This isn’t about taking guns away from responsible, law-abiding people, this is about keeping them out of the hands of people who seek to do harm — to themselves, to others, and to our communities. When the forefathers of our great nation wrote the Second Amendment they never intended for guns to be in the hands of felons, terrorists or the mentally ill. During the past six years it’s been an uphill battle to see any change come from the mass shootings that have long-since become all too commonplace in our nation, from Sandy Hook to Aurora, to Virginia Tech, San Bernardino and Orlando. This year, Congress overturned two regulations, thus making it easier for mentally ill individuals to purchase a firearm. The first required the Social Security Administrationto notify the FBI of individuals who are unable to work because of severe mental impairment and cannot manage their own Social Security financial benefits. The second required the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to similarly notify the FBI of disabled individuals who have an appointed financial steward. This is so critical because each day, 20 veterans take their lives, and the majority use firearms. I know that responsible gun owners agree with common sense gun legislation. Will Republicans ever stop defending Donald Trump? Unelected bureaucrats are running our lives While the gun lobby, manufacturers, President Trump and others may call these “midnight regulations” — rules passed in the waning days of a departing president — their history goes back a decade. In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech shooting, the House and Senate unanimously passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which required federal agencies to identify individuals who, under existing law, are prohibited from purchasing firearms. President George Bush signed it into law days later. Thank you, President Bush. It’s remarkable how far we have come — not forward, but backward. After the attack at the London Bridge, the president tweeted this: “Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That’s because they used knives and a truck!” To the president, I say if these men had guns, the number of casualties and the carnage would have likely been significantly worse. And the man in Orlando who just last week went into his former employer’s office in Orlando, had a gun and a knife. His weapon of choice was the gun. Guns in the wrong hands kill. My first speech on the Floor of the House of Representatives, just days after being sworn-in, was not one I ever imagined I would have to give. I was honoring Orlando Police Master Sgt. Deborah Clayton, a friend and former co-worker, who was gunned down by a man who had just days before killed his pregnant ex-girlfriend. We lost 64 law enforcement officers to gun violence in 2016. That’s unacceptable. How many more times do we have to see the words “mass” and “shooting” next to each other before we take action? How young do the victims have to be before we take action? How high does the victim count have to go before we take action? I fear the answer to those questions is that for some politicians there is no tragedy too great to find the political courage necessary to stand up to the gun lobby and protect Americans. Congress is preparing to vote on two more pieces of gun legislation in the coming months. The first would make it easier to buy a silencer.  A lot has changed in the 83 years since silencers were first regulated under the same law as machine guns, but criminal intent to evade capture has not. Now James Comey knows how women feel when the boss harasses them ​​POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, medIt The next legislation would force states to recognize conceal carry permits across state lines, even when a state has no requirement. This gross affront to states’ rights would allow domestic abusers, violent criminals and people untrained in even basic firearms safety to conceal a deadly weapon in every community in America. For law enforcement officers who must make split second decision when they encounter any armed individual, this is a particularly dangerous proposition. As we reach the one-year mark since the Pulse massacre, the Orlando community continues to recover, but we are resilient. June 12, 2017 will be the day we come together for, “Orlando United – A Day of Love and Kindness.” Our community will be remembered not for the shooting, but for our response to the shooting. We will stand for all of those who lost their lives, continue to comfort those who are still grieving for their loved ones, and support the survivors who continue to need us. We live in the greatest nation in the world, where no one should fear the evil that visited Orlando on June 12th, 2016. I am committed to working with my colleagues and anyone who will stand up to reduce gun violence and stand up for safer communities. “Profiles of Courage?” I see it every day in my community and I know it exists on both sides of the aisle.

Carlsmith Professor of Law, Stanford University Based on his academic research, John Donohue has served as an expert witness on behalf of various state and local governments that have been sued in efforts to overturn gun restrictions on large-capacity magazines and assault weapons. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Editor’s note: This is an updated version of an article first published on June 24, 2015. The shooting in Virginia that wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, as well as the shooting in a San Francisco UPS facility that left four dead on the very same day, have generated – yet again – the standard set of responses in the wake of a mass shooting in the United States. The details of any such tragedy often emerge slowly, but a few points can be made. While deaths from mass shootings are a relatively small part of the overall homicidal violence in America, they are particularly wrenching. The problem is worse in the U.S. than in most other industrialized nations. And it is getting worse. The political overlay of the Virginia shooting also carries a particular social harm. Any thought that guns can play a helpful role in reducing tyranny in a democratic country like the United States should quickly be dispelled. Hopefully, that message will penetrate everyone from the NRA leadership and Sen. Rand Paul to anyone on the opposite end of the political spectrum who doesn’t like the current developments of Republican rule. I’ve been researching gun violence – and what can be done to prevent it – in the U.S. for 25 years. The fact is that if the NRA claim that guns helped reduce crime were true, the U.S. would have the lowest homicide rate among industrialized nations instead of the highest one – and by a wide margin. The U.S. is by far the world leader in the number of guns in civilian hands. The stricter gun laws of other “advanced countries” have restrained homicidal violence, suicides and gun accidents – even when, in some cases, laws were introduced over massive protests from their armed citizens. Eighteen states in the U.S. and a number of cities including Chicago, New York and San Francisco have tried to reduce the unlawful use of guns as well as gun accidents by adopting laws to keep guns safely stored when they are not in use. Safe storage is a common form of gun regulation in nations with stricter gun regulations. The NRA has been battling such laws for years. But that effort was dealt a blow in June 2015 when the U.S. Supreme Court – over a strident dissent by Justices Thomas and Scalia – refused to consider the San Francisco law that required guns not in use be stored safely. This was a positive step because hundreds of thousands of guns are stolen every year, and good public policy must try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. The dissenters were alarmed by the thought that a gun stored in a safe would not be immediately available for use, but they seemed unaware of how unusual it is that a gun is helpful when someone is under attack. Statistics show only the tiniest fraction of victims of violent crime are able to use a gun in their defense. Over the period from 2007 to 2011, roughly six million nonfatal violent crimes occurred each year. Yet data from the National Crime Victimization Survey show that 99.2 percent of victims in these incidents did not protect themselves with a gun – this in a country with roughly 300 million guns in civilian hands. In fact, a classic study of 198 cases of unwanted entry into occupied single-family dwellings in Atlanta found that the invader was twice as likely to obtain the victim’s gun than to have the victim use a firearm in self-defense. The author of the study, Arthur Kellerman, concluded in words that those opposing safe storage of guns should heed: On average, the gun that represents the greatest threat is the one that is kept loaded and readily available in a bedside drawer. A loaded, unsecured gun in the home is like an insurance policy that fails to deliver at least 95 percent of the time, but has the constant potential – particularly in the case of handguns which are more easily manipulated by children and more attractive for use in crime – to harm someone in the home or be stolen and harm someone else. For years, the NRA mantra has been that allowing citizens to carry concealed handguns would reduce crime as they fought off or scared off the criminals. Some early studies even purported to show that so-called right-to-carry (RTC) laws did just that, but a 2004 report from the National Research Council refuted that claim, saying it was not supported by “the scientific evidence,” while remaining uncertain about what the true impact of RTC laws was. Ten years of additional data have allowed researchers to get a better fix on this question, which is important since the NRA is pushing for a Supreme Court decision that would allow RTC as a matter of constitutional law. The new research on this issue from my team at Stanford University has given the most compelling evidence to date that RTC laws are associated with significant increases in violent crime. Looking at Uniform Crime Reports data from 1979 to 2014, we find that, on average, the 33 states that adopted RTC laws over this period experienced violent crime rates that are roughly 14 percent higher after 10 years than if they had not adopted these laws. In the meantime, can anything make American politicians listen to the preferences of the 90 percent on the wisdom of adopting universal background checks for gun purchases? As an academic exercise, one might speculate whether law could play a constructive role in reducing the number or deadliness of mass shootings. Most other advanced nations apparently think so, since they make it far harder for someone like your typical American mass killer to get his hands on particularly lethal weapons. Universal background checks are common features of gun regulation in other developed countries, including: While mass shootings, as well as gun homicides and suicides, are not unknown in these countries, the overall rates are substantially higher in the United States than in these nations. While NRA supporters frequently challenge me on these statistics, saying that this is only because American blacks are so violent, pointing to the type of wildly incorrect claims about the percentages of whites killed by blacks that Dylann Roof spouted and Donald Trump tweeted, it is important to note that white murder rates in the U.S. are well over twice as high as the murder rates in any of these other countries. The story of Australia, which had 13 mass shootings in the 18-year period from 1979 to 1996 but none in the succeeding 21 years, is worth examining. The turning point was the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, in which a gunman killed 35 individuals using semiautomatic weapons. In the wake of the massacre, the conservative federal government succeeded in implementing tough new gun control laws throughout the country. A large array of weapons were banned – including the Glock semiautomatic handgun used in the Charleston shootings. The government also imposed a mandatory gun buy-back that substantially reduced gun possession in Australia. The effect was that both gun suicides and homicides fell. In addition, the 1996 legislation disallowed self-defense as a legitimate reason to purchase a firearm. When I mention this to disbelieving NRA supporters, they insist that crime must now be rampant in Australia. In fact, the Australian murder rate has fallen to one per 100,000 while the U.S. rate, thankfully lower than in the early 1990s, is still roughly 5 per 100,000 – nearly five times as high. Moreover, robberies in Australia occur at only about half the rate of the U.S.: 58 in Australia versus 113.1 per 100,000 in the U.S. in 2012. How did Australia do it? Politically, it took a brave prime minister to face the rage of Australian gun interests. Prime Minister John Howard wore a bullet-proof vest when he announced the proposed gun restrictions in June 1996. The deputy prime minister was hung in effigy. But Australia did not have a domestic gun industry to oppose the new measures so the will of the people was allowed to emerge. And today, support for the safer, gun-restricted Australia is so strong that going back would not be tolerated by the public. That Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since 1996 is likely more than merely the result of the considerable reduction in guns – it’s certainly not the case that guns have disappeared altogether. I suspect that the country has also experienced a cultural shift between the shock of the Port Arthur massacre and the removal of guns from everyday life, as they are no longer available for self-defense and they are simply less present throughout the country. Troubled individuals, in other words, are not constantly being reminded that guns are a means to address their alleged grievances to the extent that they were in the past, or continue to be in the U.S. Of course, strict gun regulations cannot ensure that the danger of mass shootings or killings has been eliminated. Norway has strong gun control and committed humane values. But that didn’t prevent Anders Breivik from opening fire on a youth camp on the island of Utoya in 2011. His clean criminal record and hunting license had allowed him to secure semiautomatic rifles, but Norway restricted his ability to get high-capacity clips for them. In his manifesto, Breivik wrote about his attempts to legally buy weapons, stating, “I envy our European American brothers as the gun laws in Europe sucks ass in comparison.” In fact, in the same manifesto, Breivik wrote that it was from a U.S. supplier that he purchased – and had mailed – 10 30-round ammunition magazines for the rifle he used in his attack. In other words, even if a particular nation or state chooses to make it harder for some would-be killers to get their weapons, these efforts can be undercut by the jurisdictions that hold out. In the U.S., of course, state gun control measures are often thwarted by the lax attitude to gun acquisition in other states. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday the company has asked all of its local TV and digital ads to be removed from all NBC News programming until after the episode airs. The interview, which has caused an uproar due to Jones’ promotion of several controversial conspiracy theories, is scheduled to air on June 18. The company’s chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, tweeted her disapproval of the interview Monday morning. “As an advertiser, I’m repulsed that @megynkelly would give a second of airtime to someone who says Sandy Hook and Aurora are hoaxes,” she wrote. “Why?” Also Read: Alex Jones Demands Megyn Kelly Interview Be Canceled: She 'Lied to Me' (Video) Also Read: Alex Jones Demands Megyn Kelly Interview Be Canceled: She 'Lied to Me' (Video) In a 97-second preview of the interview, Jones calls the 9/11 attacks an “inside job” and questions the legitimacy of the Sandy Hook shootings.

The interview has been met with widespread condemnation from those who object to Kelly giving Jones a mainstream platform to express his views. Kelly defended the interview on Twitter, writing that because of Jones’ connections to President Donald Trump, it is her responsibility to “shine a light.” Also Read: Megyn Kelly Lands Jackie Levin as Executive Producer For NBC Morning Show Also Read: Megyn Kelly Lands Jackie Levin as Executive Producer For NBC Morning Show However, Jones himself has also called on the interview to be canceled, claiming that Kelly misrepresented his views.

358,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/18/trump-mean-health-care-democrats-239695,"Congress ‘You can almost see the ads being written already,’ one GOP aide said. By JOSH DAWSEY and SEUNG MIN KIM 06/18/2017 09:09 PM EDT President Donald Trump's tendency to make impolitic remarks also leaves such a slip harder to exploit. | Getty Democrats are seeking to capitalize on President Donald Trump calling the Republican health care bill ""mean"" ahead of the Senate's vote to repeal Obamacare, seeing it as a pivotal moment in an issue that could drive the 2018 midterm elections. The comments from Trump, made privately to senators last week, were largely overshadowed by a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice and new developments in the special counsel's investigation into Trump and his associates. But a senior Democratic aide said the party plans to revive the ""mean"" comment as part of floor speeches, news conferences and social media, and consultants said they craved the image of Trump celebrating in the Rose Garden with House members over a ""mean"" bill that hurt poor Americans. ""We will be weaving 'mean' into the broader attack in a prominent way,"" the aide said. Democrats see the health care fight as more potent than an investigation into potential collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice — and a possibly defining gaffe for commercials, according to aides. Hitting Republicans in the House for a bill that ""even Trump said was mean"" is particularly satisfying for Democrats, considering the president celebrated its passage in the Rose Garden. In an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll before Georgia's 6th Congressional District runoff this week, the House health care overhaul polled lower than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Trump, Republican candidate Karen Handel, Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff.

But Democrats have struggled to come up with a united message on health care and have faced criticism because insurance companies have raised premiums and pulled out of health care exchanges in some states. Whether Trump's ""mean"" comment becomes a potent line of attack against the president — as the Democrats hope — or unifies moderate Senate Republicans to pass a health care bill that squeaks to a 50-vote margin remains unclear. “I think it’s unifying,” added Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “At the end of the day, it’s helpful for us in getting the support that we need for the vote."" Should the Senate pass a vastly different bill, which is then adopted by the House, the scathing internal attack could be blunted. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said the party was already planning to make the bill more generous. Trump's tendency to make impolitic remarks also leaves such a gaffe harder to exploit. One person who has spoken with Trump says he has also criticized the Senate health care process and some of GOP senators' wishes. This person said Trump had been stung by the nonstop negative news coverage of the House bill, particularly reports that more than 20 million people or more could lose insurance. ""In the list of things he's said, I don't think this one is high up there on the list,"" one administration official said. Congress By AUSTIN WRIGHT A second administration official said the White House knows the health care push to 50 votes is a difficult one, and the White House has heard more complaints from moderates than conservatives in the Senate. Trump, this person said, was trying to show the path he saw to getting a better bill passed. But it certainly left some Republicans in the House upset, particularly conservatives who were cajoled and cursed at by Trump, then feted by the president in a Rose Garden party, complete with a jazz band, when the bill passed. The Heritage Foundation, for example, wrote an op-ed decrying the Trump attack as ""not mean,"" defending the bill as good small-government policy. ""You can almost see the ads being written already,"" one GOP aide said. In the Senate, where Republicans are still struggling to craft legislation that can pick up 50 GOP votes, Trump’s ""mean"" comments left the sense that the president wants a health care measure that is easier to defend. Several GOP senators said Trump’s comments can only help in putting together a bill that is more politically palatable and substantively improved from the measure that passed the House in May. For instance, Trump’s comments insisting the Senate bill not be viewed as an attack on low-income Americans would seem to shore up arguments from centrist Republicans who want Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion phased out more gradually — a major contention point in the conference that has yet to be settled. HEALTH CARE By RACHANA PRADHAN But typical for a president not steeped in policy, Trump’s private remarks calling for a more generous health care bill — or legislation that is not so “mean,” according to some accounts — left it wide open for Republicans to interpret them in myriad ways. “I’m not sure what that means,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of the president’s remarks. “I’m a very generous person. I help people who don’t have insurance. I want everybody to have health care. I think no physician should turn down treatment of people based on that."" Nonetheless, Republicans are at real risk of missing their Fourth of July recess deadline to vote on their Obamacare replacement, with factions of their conference still deeply divided over when to end the Medicaid expansion and how best to lower health insurance premiums. “We keep talking about the same stuff over and over and over and over and over again,” complained Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “At some point, we’re going to have to have votes. And right now — the reason why we keep talking about the same stuff over and over again — we don’t have the votes.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

								8:08 PM By Ritchie King, Carl Bialik and Andrew Flowers Filed under Mass Shootings The shooting that killed at least 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, on Wednesday is the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. this year but far from the first. It wasn’t even the first to occur on Wednesday. A shooting early in the morning in Savannah, Georgia, killed one person and injured three others.  What qualifies as a mass shooting depends on who is counting. By at least two measures, mass shootings have become more common. We looked at three often-cited data sources and compared their definitions and counts. In 2013, users of the social commenting site Reddit created a crowd-sourced tracker of mass shootings that isn’t restricted to fatal incidents; it covers cases in which at least four people were injured or killed, potentially including the shooter. Because of this broad definition, the Mass Shooting Tracker data set is the largest of these three. But since the data only goes back to the beginning of 2013, it doesn’t offer any insight into long-term trends. Mother Jones magazine gathered data on mass shootings for a 2012 investigation and has continued to update its list, counting 72 incidents from 1982 through Tuesday. The magazine uses relatively strict criteria — the incidents must occur in public places and can’t involve gangs or robbery. The primary motive must be mass murder. Also, Mother Jones excludes incidents in which the shooter killed three people or fewer — meaning that its count doesn’t include the shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week that killed three people. Events that fit the criteria are rare — the high in a single year was seven, in 2012. That means single large events have a big impact on the data, making it noisy. But the long-term trend is clear: There have been more total mass shooting incidents and deaths in the 11 years starting with 2005 than there were in the previous 23 years combined. The shooting in San Bernardino on Wednesday was also labeled as an “active shooter” incident. The FBI defines an active-shooter incident as an individual or individuals “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.” The agency counted 160 such incidents from 2000 to 2013 in which a total of 557 people were wounded and 486 killed. And the FBI found that these shootings were on the rise: There were 115 active-shooter incidents in the last seven years of the data set, up from 45 in the first seven years. However mass shootings are defined, the deaths they cause represent a small proportion of all homicides committed with firearms in the U.S., which have declined from a decade ago, as has the overall murder rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This story has been updated to include charts showing the full range of available data from Mother Jones’s mass shootings data set and the FBI’s active-shooter data set.

362,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/hV_vmkvNjCs/,"Trump supporters gathered at the White House Sunday afternoon to protest political violence at a “Rally For Peace,” calling out establishment journalists for creating a climate of partisan hatred that has recently exploded with a shocking attack near the nation’s capital. The “Rally For Peace” was held in Washington, DC, by Trump supporters and conservatives aiming to protest political violence and the media voices that incite it. The recent shooting at a congressional baseball practice in which five were wounded and Republican politician Steve Scalise was hospitalized was a topic of discussion at the event, as well as the riots caused by radical leftist antifa groups at conservative events across the country, including former Breitbart Senior Editor Milo Yiannopoulos’s event at Berkeley in February. The event was organized by conservative political activist Jack Posobiec and Mike Cernovich, independent author and InfoWars radio host. Cernovich challenged activists on the left to a public debate, offering up $1 million to charity in exchange for a live broadcasted debate between Cernovich and Sam Harris and Alex Jones and Keith Olbermann. Cernovich claimed that despite this offer, the leftist commentators refused to respond to the debate request: Cernovich speech https://t.co/J3XZTq21LI — Anna Khait (@Annakhait) June 25, 2017 Other “New Right” pro-Trump figures spoke at the rally, including Virginia politician Corey Stewart, who can be seen addressing the crowd in the video below: https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879015930977804288 While Gateway Pundit reporter Lucian Wintrich and Big League Politics contributor Cassandra Fairbanks listed a number of fake hate crimes committed over the past year in an attempt to paint Trump supporters and conservatives as racists. https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879021878999998464 The rally was not interrupted by antifa anarchists or far-left protesters, but a rival alt-right protest formed nearby. Conservative groups such as the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers were on hand to provide security as they do at many other events. https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879029291996131328 Former Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone was set to speak at the event but reportedly could not appear due to security concerns. InfoWars host Alex Jones was unable to attend the event as he was spending the day with his family but did send a note of apology to Mike Cernovich which was read aloud by Jack Posobiec at the event. Demonstrators shared videos and photos from the event, displaying American flags, “Kekistan” meme references, and lots of Trump campaign-style “MAGA” merchandise: People starting to arrive at the #RallyForPeace pic.twitter.com/00LwzFK6ZH — Cassandra Fairbanks ❤️⏳ (@CassandraRules) June 25, 2017 The rally has its own flag pole — complete w Blue Lives Matter flag pic.twitter.com/axLAxYF1ek — Will Sommer (@willsommer) June 25, 2017 https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/879017669005107201 https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879030710937497601 https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/879036299369426944 https://twitter.com/hatedtruthpig77/status/879053433285861377 #CNNisISIS #RallyForPeace pic.twitter.com/qLKlPn8vec — Michael Flynn Jr⭐️⭐️⭐️ (@mflynnJR) June 25, 2017 The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was in attendance, clearly spooked by increased scrutiny after a fan of the “anti-hate” group attempted to murder dozens of Republican lawmakers. The gunman, the late James Hodgkinson, is the second high-profile case of a left-wing partisan attacking an SPLC target; in August 2012, Floyd Lee Corkins attempted to “kill as many as possible” at the DC office of the Family Research Council, using the SPLC website’s “Hate Map” to pick the site for a mass shooting. The SPLC’s representative behaved like a campaign tracker Sunday, tweeting quotes from speakers and attendees as proof of right-wing bigotry. In one of three tweets covering the rally, the SPLC @hatewatch account incorrectly identified one attendee as a “speaker” and singled him out for saying left-wing activist billionaire George Soros should be put in a “gas chamber.” At the ""Rally Against Political Violence"" in DC, this speaker just said ""It's time to put George Soros in a gas chamber!"" pic.twitter.com/fusoudjdlK — Hatewatch (@Hatewatch) June 25, 2017 Reached for comment, Posobiec attacked “fake news” SPLC for its factual error and touted the event as a success: I did not hear his comments which were not made at my rally, and I disavow any and all hate speech from both the left and the right. He is not a speaker he was not on my speaking bill and did not speak at the rally. SPLC is fake news. I got a crowd of Trump supporters to sing “Give Peace a Chance” by John Lennon, and that’s a testament to our commitment to peace and our stand against violence and violent rhetoric. SPLC has refused to retract its attacks on Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) which accuse him of being a white supremacist, even after Hodgkinson shot Scalise in the hip during a practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event and put the House Majority Whip in critical condition. Other left-wing figures have mocked and attacked Scalise and Republicans in the aftermath of the shooting, and establishment reporters as a whole have moved on from the shocking assault — in contrast to the weeks spent forcing Republicans to answer for the 2011 shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (R-AZ) — whose attacker had no political motivation. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Tuesday, 13 June 2017 11:14 AM Kelly interviewed Jones about the shooting and his views during an interview for ""Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly"" to air June 18, according to The Washington Post. His conspiracy theories have included that the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Connecticut, was a government hoax. ""Sandy Hook Promise, a leading gun violence prevention organization, and NBC host Megyn Kelly have agreed that Kelly will no longer host the organization's annual Promise Champions Gala on Wednesday, June 14th, in Washington D.C.,"" the organization's statement said. ""This decision was spurred by NBC’s planned broadcast of Kelly’s interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who believes the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown … was a hoax."" Nicole Hockley, co-founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, urged NBC and Kelly to not air the interview. ""Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones,"" Hockley said in the statement. Sandy Hook Promise found an unlikely ally against the interview in Jones himself, who now says Kelly duped him and misrepresented his position on the Sandy Hook tragedy, according to The Washington Post. I'm calling for @megynkelly to cancel the airing of our interview for misrepresenting my views on Sandy Hook - https://t.co/TfLEPHEYrd ""Megyn Kelly lied to me several weeks before she came here, and she said the interview was not going to be about Sandy Hook and the mass shooting there,"" Jones said in a video, noted the Post. ""My listeners questioned it (Sandy Hook shootings). … I played devil's advocate by saying maybe none of it happened and it was all fake. The other side of me believes those parents I've seen on TV, and real mass shootings happen, so it probably did happen,"" he continued. Kelly defended her interview on Twitter, pointing out that President Donald Trump has appeared on his show and complimented the radio host, and he has been given White House press credentials, the Post noted. POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show. He's giving Infowars a WH press credential. Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light. https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz  © 2021 Newsmax.

By EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE 06/14/2017 06:23 PM EDT ""We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” President Donald Trump said Wednesday. | AP Photo America in 2017 is a place where a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice is a surprise, but not a shock. Just like the rest of what happened Wednesday. The thoughts and prayers echo statements that came after other shootings. President Donald Trump delivered a sober and unifying message from the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi gave warm, embracing speeches on the floor. But pretty much everyone expects that Trump will tweet something inflammatory before long. And that Ryan and Pelosi will be back attacking each other by next week, if not by the end of this week. And that any big show of changing up the congressional baseball game to be East vs. West instead of Republicans vs. Democrats will have about the same lasting effect than when senators went as bipartisan pairs to the State of the Union the week after Gabby Giffords was shot. Meanwhile, the question now looms of how the mainstream left responds to the act of violence coming from within its own ranks, even as Bernie Sanders, whose presidential campaign the shooter supported online and on the trail, issued a statement saying he is “sickened by this despicable act” and pleading for nonviolence. In Washington, it was yet another day on edge about what happens next, with the distinctive swirl of factors around the Trump White House, like a son who quickly tweeted about the connection between the shooting and the Kathy Griffin photo and a Central Park production of “Julius Caesar” that he’s been raging about, and the president had White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoting unconfirmed information about the shooter before the White House made a statement. America in 2017 is also a place where people decry the shooting of House Whip Steve Scalise, two staffers and two Capitol police officers, and swear this time will be different. But they've sworn that before — and then, after a politically acceptable period of public self-recrimination and calls for a change, start churning the anger again, harder. People tweet about murdering and raping political opponents. They show up at rallies with guns.

They are not discouraged. “I can only hope that Democrats do tone down the rhetoric,” Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said in a local radio interview, which didn’t exactly match Ryan declaring to his colleagues in the House, “an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.” ""This could be the first political rhetorical terrorist attack,"" Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said on CNN. Giffords was shot in the head at a constituent event in her district all of six years ago. “Don’t politicize it!” shouted the people who didn’t want to talk about gun control or silencer regulations, though as many gun control advocates point out, insisting that gun control can’t be discussed in the wake of a gun incident is itself a politicization. “Terrorism” has also become a politicized word, with debates over whether the racially motivated shooting at the Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 was a terrorist attack, whether the San Bernardino shooter with hazy ISIS ties was a terrorist attack, whether the white man who shot two Indian immigrants in Kansas in February was a terrorist. “We do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said. | AP Photo “We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because above all, they love our country,” said the president on Wednesday — though this is the same president who made encouraging violence against protesters a standard of his campaign rallies last year. Partisans spend hours bulging at each other on social media and in person, raging about each other’s idiocy and treachery. If you don’t agree, you’re not American, or you’re not human. This is the same country where a North Carolina Republican Party office was firebombed. This is the same city where a man started shooting up a pizzeria in Northwest Washington six months ago because online conspiracy mongers had convinced him that John Podesta was part of a child sex ring being run out of the basement. Waiting for the shooter to be identified, people held their breath and prepared their talking points to slot him into. If he had an Arabic name. If he had ties to white supremacist groups. If he had political statements on his Facebook page. James Hodgkinson is dead, but now his life and police record and social media accounts can be attached to whatever narratives people want. “We can all agree that we are blessed to be Americans, that our children deserve to grow up in a nation of safety and peace, and that we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” Trump said Wednesday. “We do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber,” said Ryan after Trump spoke. “We are not one caucus or the other in this House today, but we speak for each other,” said Pelosi after Ryan spoke. Then there was the reaction in the less august settings. ""A Democrat campaign volunteer who deeply believed the president and his advisers were traitors tried to murder Republican congressmen,” said Michael Caputo, a Republican operative fired from Trump’s campaign last year, in a radio interview he had someone promoting on his behalf. “For nine months, Democratic Party leaders have lied, regularly calling me and my friends traitors, so forgive me if I'm not more tender with their karma in Alexandria.""

            Business The gunman, James Hodgkinson, who was shot dead by law enforcement, is believed to have used an SKS 7.62-millimeter caliber rifle in the attack, a law enforcement source told CNN. Investigators also recovered a 9-millimeter handgun at the scene, but it is not known whether Hodgkinson fired it. Investigators said Thursday that they have no indication Hodgkinson bought either gun illegally. The SKS is a semiautomatic rifle developed by the Soviet Union in 1945, according to the National Rifle Association gun museum, which has one in its collection. It was the model used by Micah Xavier Johnson, who killed five police officers in Dallas last year before he was killed by a bomb squad robot. The SKS was mass-produced by the Soviet Union, and later in China and various Soviet satellite countries, and many are readily available in the United States, still in working order. They can be purchased online for as little as $400. U.S. soldiers went into combat against Chinese soldiers and Viet Cong guerrillas armed with SKS rifles in the Korean and Vietnam wars, according to the NRA. Related: Alexandria mass shooter legally owned his SKS ""The Korean and Vietnamese physical environments both imposed great demands on human endurance, so a light gun such as the SKS fit well, imposing minimum exertion on its users,"" said the NRA museum site, in its history of the gun. The SKS typically has a wooden stock and a non-detachable magazine with a capacity of 10 rounds of 7.62-millimeter caliber, the same caliber ammunition used in the AK-47s that eventually replaced the SKS.  But they can also be outfitted with detachable magazines with larger ammunition capacities of 40 rounds made by American companies like ProMag. The SKS is quite different from the AR-15, America's answer to the AK-47. The AR-15 has a stock made of plastic instead of wood and uses .223-caliber ammo and detachable magazines with a capacity of 100 rounds or more. Related: Who will be the new enemy for Trump and the NRA? Another significant difference: The AR-15 and AK-47 have pistol grips, while the SKS does not. Pistol grips are one of the factors that gun control advocates use to distinguish what they call assault rifles, which are often the targets of gun control legislation. The AR-15, lightweight and easy to shoot and reload, has been used repeatedly in mass shootings, including the attacks at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.

THE LATEST ON STEVE SCALISE -- “Scalise remains in critical condition after mass shooting,” by Louis Nelson, John Bresnahan, and Jake Sherman: “House Majority Whip Steve Scalise is in critical condition in a Washington hospital, and will require additional surgeries after a bullet pierced his hip, injured organs and caused ‘severe bleeding,’ according to a statement Wednesday night. Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, is in MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Northwest D.C., where he has had at least two procedures, and ‘multiple units of blood transfusion,’ the hospital said Wednesday night. Scalise was brought to the hospital in ‘shock,’ the statement said. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited the hospital Wednesday night, and brought the Scalise family flowers.” http://politi.co/2ru9BWi -- @realDonaldTrump at 9:41 p.m.: “Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!” STATEMENT FROM MATT MIKA’S FAMILY: “Matt suffered multiple gunshot wounds. He recently came out of surgery but remains in the ICU in critical condition and we expect him to stay there for at least several days. Our family is now here with him and we continue to ask for privacy and understanding while we focus on Matt and his recovery. “Many have asked about Matt and what we can share about him. While the attack today was a terrible surprise, Matt’s presence on the ball field, helping longtime colleagues and friends was not. He is a very thoughtful, fun-loving person who is competitive and loyal; all things which contributed to his continued commitment to the Congressional Baseball Game.” -- “Who were the people injured at Wednesday’s baseball practice shooting?,” by Rachael Bade, Theo Meyer, John Lauinger, and Kyle Cheney: http://politi.co/2tppcmG **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh THE VENEER, SHATTERED. Members of Congress have long thought of Washington as a safe space, of sorts. Sure, they engage in heated rhetoric in the Capitol, waging partisan war from early in the morning until late at night. But their life in Washington is quite sheltered: they exercise in a members-only gym. Many of them sleep in their offices in the Capitol complex. They eat and drink together at partisan social clubs. But we’re hearing a refrain we first heard in 2011, when Gabby Giffords was shot: we’re sitting ducks. -- FROM USA TODAY’S HEIDI PRZYBYLA: “[L]awmakers including Cedric Richmond, D-La., had expressed fears last week about member safety. Richmond, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, raised his concerns directly to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.” https://usat.ly/2rjOi5E Richmond is a good friend of Scalise’s, as well. THE SENSE OF SHOCK in the Capitol -- especially the House -- is extraordinarily palpable. The mood was tense all day, and remained uncertain at night. Several House Republicans were texting us throughout the evening, wondering about the severity of Scalise’s injuries. Lawmakers are extraordinarily shaken. Forget party affiliation: Congress -- and Washington -- is a big saga with a set of predictable characters: lawmakers, aides, lobbyists, reporters. And when one gets hurt, sick, injured -- many realize it could easily be them. And a shooting like this is causing lawmakers and staff to take stock of their own safety. Countless lawmakers we spoke to throughout the day yesterday were rethinking their out-in-front, prominent roles in today’s political scene. CAPITOL HILL REPORTERS were shaken up, as well. First of all, dozens of reporters work in the Capitol every day. And unlike the White House -- which regularly dumps all over reporters and decries their work product as phony -- lawmakers on the Hill are generally cordial with journalists in the Capitol and respect the job we do. We spend years covering lawmakers up close and oftentimes develop an easy rapport with people like Scalise -- savvy pols who successfully make their way up the leadership ladder. Scalise shows up at off-the-record happy hours for reporters at the annual Republican retreat. His office, like others, throws cocktail receptions to get to become better acquainted with Capitol Hill reporters. That doesn’t mean the relationship isn’t adversarial at times -- it most definitely is. It means building a personal relationship -- getting to know each other as human beings -- is important to both sides. We know Scalise, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer as politicians, but most of us have had many occasions to talk to them on a personal level, as well. --“Photos: Following the aftermath of the congressional shooting” -- 43 pix http://politi.co/2sdsCd0 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP is getting bipartisan plaudits so far for his strong speech Wednesday, and his visit to Scalise family in the hospital Wednesday night.

Chris Murphy sprang into action almost immediately after a gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub - accusing Congress of an ‘unconscionable deafening silence’ and launching a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor. But the gun-control advocate who once argued that lawmakers should put forward ‘legislative action within an hour of a shooting’ was more circumspect on Wednesday after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in the suburbs of Washington. One tragic incident, he acknowledged, won’t move the needle - even one that affected one of their own, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). … “[T]he tone among even the most ardent proponents of stricter gun laws was dramatically different. In multiple interviews, several Democratic lawmakers urged that no, today was not the day to revive the dormant gun control debate. It was too soon, it hit too close to home - and lawmakers simply didn’t want to stand accused of politicizing a shooting that injured a colleague and friend.” http://politi.co/2t50qZx -- JONATHAN MARTIN on A18 of the NYT: “Their Own Targeted, G.O.P. Lawmakers Want Looser Gun Laws, Not Stricter Ones.” http://nyti.ms/2s3RtBh ON THE HOUSE FLOOR TODAY -- HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY will “offer a resolution to commend the heroic actions of Capitol Police and other first responders, and recognize everyone affected by this tragic incident."" A message from Amazon: Watch what happened when Amazon raised their starting wage to $15/hr in 2018. BEHIND THE SCENES -- FROM KYLE CHENEY, our incredibly versatile House reporter who spent the day in Alexandria reporting on the shooting: “In the course of reporting from Alexandria, I had two eye-opening encounters with witnesses that really gnawed at me during such a harrowing moment. I arrived at the ballpark less than an hour after the shooting and overheard one witness – a man possibly in his mid-20s -- excitedly describing the incident in vivid detail over the phone. It was still a murky situation at that point, so as soon as he hung up, I asked him if he could repeat to me what he had seen. “The man immediately tensed up and told me that there was no way he’d talk to the media because he can’t stand the press and he thinks we’re all complicit in leaking (of what, I’m not sure). I told him I personally hadn’t ‘leaked’ anything but in fact knew and reported on some of the people on the field that morning – and that his information might help provide some clarity at a critical moment. He still refused. A short while later, while holed up in a coffee shop across from the field, I chatted with a young woman who also witnessed the aftermath. She said she took comfort when she found out the assailant had targeted members of Congress – not because she wished them any harm but because it would’ve been more unnerving, she said, had the violence been random. Both conversations were revealing about some of the sad realities we now live with. “It’s only fair if I also mention that these encounters were exceptions on a day of many kindnesses. Most witnesses were forthcoming with as much detail as they could muster, and I watched as random passersby delivered Gatorade, iced tea and even a bag full of Chick-fil-A to police on the scene. And the police then shared the spoils with journalists, pedestrians and others baking in the Alexandria sun.” WAPO SCOOP -- “Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, officials say,” by Devlin Barrett, Adam Entous, Ellen Nakashima and Sari Horowitz: “The move by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to investigate Trump’s conduct marks a major turning point in the nearly year-old FBI investigation, which until recently focused on Russian meddling during the presidential campaign and on whether there was any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Investigators have also been looking for any evidence of possible financial crimes among Trump associates, officials said. … “Five people briefed on the interview requests, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said that Daniel Coats, the current director of national intelligence, Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and Rogers’s recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett, agreed to be interviewed by Mueller’s investigators as early as this week. The investigation has been cloaked in secrecy, and it is unclear how many others have been questioned by the FBI. … “The White House now refers all questions about the Russia investigation to Trump’s personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz. ‘The FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,’ said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Kasowitz.” http://wapo.st/2rjkqqo -- WSJ’s Del Quentin Wilber, Shane Harris and Paul Sonne: “The special counsel also plans to interview Rick Ledgett, who recently retired as the deputy director of the NSA … While Mr. Ledgett was still in office, he wrote a memo documenting a phone call that Mr. Rogers had with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the matter. During the call, the president questioned the veracity of the intelligence community’s judgment that Russia had interfered with the election and tried to persuade Mr. Rogers to say there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russian officials.” http://on.wsj.com/2sD4vXP HUFFPOST and DRUDGE earlier this morning had pretty much the same banner – HuffPo: “BDAY PRESENT FOR PREZ: OBSTRUCTION INQUIRY” ... Drudge: “WASH POST BDAY PRESENT TO TRUMP: MUELLER PROBES OBSTRUCTION”. CAN’T STOP, WON’T STOP -- “Manafort still doing international work,” by Ken Vogel: “Paul Manafort is at the center of an FBI investigation into ties between President Donald Trump’s team and the Russians, but that hasn’t stopped him from doing business with international figures and companies, partly by claiming continued access to Trump, according to people familiar with his dealings. “Manafort in recent weeks has either consulted or worked with a Chinese construction billionaire looking to expand his business overseas and a telecommunications firm interested in regulatory approval from governments in Asia and the Middle East, as well as an investment fund claiming links to the Chinese government, according to documents and interviews. “Manafort quietly consulted on a proposal under which the Chinese fund — the China Development Fund — would invest $30 billion or more in the Puerto Rican government's bond debt and possibly the island's critical infrastructure, according to documents and interviews with four people familiar with the negotiations, including a Manafort business partner. “One of the people, a lawyer involved in the discussions, said Manafort indicated that he could convince the Trump administration to support any resulting deal, because he’s remained in contact with Trump’s team, and that he played a role in helping to soften Trump's tough campaign rhetoric on China. ‘He’s going around telling people that he’s still talking to the president and -- even more than that -- that he is helping to shape Trump’s foreign policy,’ said the lawyer involved in the discussions.” http://politi.co/2rjtsDO TARA PALMERI AND KEN VOGEL: “Trump huddled with donors on day of Comey testimony”: “On the same day last week that fired FBI Director James Comey delivered his damaging Senate testimony, President Donald Trump’s team summoned about a dozen top donors to the White House to rally support for Trump’s agenda. The donors -- including Ken Griffin, Doug DeVos, Tom Hicks, Jr., Bekah Mercer, Todd Ricketts, Tom Saunders, Paul Singer and Dick Uihlein -- gathered in the Roosevelt Room on June 8 for a briefing from Trump’s legislative director Marc Short, according to a senior administration official and other people familiar with the event. “These people said that Trump himself stopped by the briefing to greet the donors, while Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway also spent time at the event. … A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the donor briefing. But a senior administration official said that topics covered during the briefing included healthcare, tax reform, the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch, pending judicial nominations, the Paris accord and the Saudi arms sale. ‘[It was a] 'here's what we see as the legislative calendar and how you can be helpful' type of meeting,’ the official said.” http://politi.co/2rtB8HL COMING ATTRACTIONS -- “Jeh Johnson to testify publicly in House Russia probe,” by Austin Wright: “Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is set to testify publicly next Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia’s election meddling, according to a congressional source.

Hodgkinson lived a seemingly comfortable existence back home. He had a wife, friends and a pool where he hosted parties. How and why his life ended on a blood-soaked field halfway across the nation remains largely a mystery to investigators trying to piece together his life. Anger, plain and simple, seemed to be one driver. A man prone to aggressive outbursts, Hodgkinson had grown increasingly angry at the political order in recent years, lashing out online against President Donald Trump and other Republicans. ... “Hodgkinson was no stranger to law enforcement. He had a lengthy arrest record and seemed prone to violent fits. Most recently, he had been warned about shooting a high-powered gun in the vicinity of his neighbors’ houses. ... In April 2006, he was arrested on firearms and battery charges after he allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face and pulled a 12-gauge shotgun on a witness, Joel Fernandez, who had attempted to intervene.”  http://politi.co/2s4g6Ot THE BIG PICTURE -- “How an Annual Ballgame Has Kept Congress Civil,” by Ben Strauss for Politico Magazine: “What might seem like just a bunch of middle-aged men reliving their high school glory, has become in recent years a meaningful tribute to the painfully nostalgic notion of old-fashioned bipartisanship in an increasingly divided nation. And so while one baseball team -- this one made up of Republican Congressmen and Senators -- cowered behind fences and trees to save their lives, their ostensible opponents -- a group of Democratic lawmakers -- gathered in a dugout 10 miles away in Northeast Washington.

We don’t really know—and that’s bad news for our democracy”: “One idea floated was that each member of Congress should designate his or her own list of successors in case of incapacitation—with those successors serving until either the next regular election or the member regained the ability to hold office. Several states, including Delaware and Texas, had passed similar bills during the 1950s and 1960s at the height of the Cold War to reconstitute their state legislatures following a nuclear attack. Two former House speakers, Thomas Foley and Newt Gingrich, endorsed that ‘expeditious path’ to solving the congressional continuity issue and preserving the House’s directly elected ‘legitimacy.’” http://politi.co/2rjrgfy FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Turkish Guards Will Be Charged in Embassy Protest, Officials Say,” by NYT’s Nick Fandos: “Law enforcement officials plan to announce charges Thursday against a dozen members of the Turkish president’s security detail for their involvement in a brutal attack on protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence here last month, two American officials said on Wednesday. ...

On Thursday, the former NBA player gave the country’s sports minister a copy of Trump’s book ‘The Art of the Deal,’ a present intended for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It wasn’t signed by Trump, who was Rodman’s boss for two seasons of the ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ reality TV show. Rodman has said his visit has nothing to do with the White House.” http://apne.ws/2rz07EJ MEDIAWATCH -- GABE SHERMAN in NYMag, “Fox News Is Dropping Its ‘Fair & Balanced’ Slogan”: “As Fox News moves further into the post–Roger Ailes era, the network is shedding one of its most iconic elements. According to network executives, Fox News has abandoned the marketing slogan ‘Fair & Balanced.’ ... [One] executive explained that the tagline was ‘too closely associated with Roger.’ Fox executives have been instructed by management to market the network by its other tagline: ‘Most Watched.

370,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/i2obhuKASDE/,"Emmy Award winner Eric McCormack is known for providing comedic relief on Will & Grace, but now the actor is teaming up with other performers to highlight a very serious issue. McCormack, 54, alongside Tony nominee Terrence Mann and Oscar nominee Tess Harper, will be featured on a new concept album entitled GUNS: The Album. “I was thrilled to contribute, in my small way, to this project,” McCormack tells PEOPLE exclusively. “Musically, it is brilliant and soaring and ambitious as hell. Culturally, it is downright crucial.” McCormack lends his voice to the song “Welcome to the Gun Show.” Described as “a mix of filmic anthems, bold hip hop, flashy show tunes and more that touch on all sides of the debate,” the album aims to spark conversation amidst the huge controversy of American gun control and gun violence. As fraught as the gun debate in America has become, creators Braxton Molinaro and Jonathan Sokolow say that the release of this album hopes to get more people talking about how firearms impact our society, as well as create more accessible ways for people to learn the truth about these weapons. “By using music to contribute to the debate, we hope Americans can connect with one another through these songs and eventually find common ground when it comes to the issue of guns,” Molinaro says. According to the creators, the songs on the album are expected to encompass the “vast and ever-evolving” perspectives on the gun debate. Some of these include the practicality in controlling the amount of firearms in the country, the easy process in which one can acquire a gun (“American Gun”), the traditional use of guns in hunting (“Thrill of the Hunt”) and the mass shooting epidemic from a survivor’s perspective (“On Columbine”). Pre-order is available now at GUNSthealbum.com and will be released on all commercial music networks, including iTunes, SoundCloud and Spotify on June 22. But PEOPLE has an exclusive premiere of the haunting first single, “300,000,000” featuring vocals by Aleque Reid, Dan Henig and Bethany Thomas. “We understand that with 300,000,000 guns in this country, it would be impossible and unrealistic to simply eliminate their presence,” says Sokolow. “This album is not meant to be pro or anti-gun, but to promote gun control and education about this issue.”  Other artists lined up for the project include Frances Fisher (Titanic), Mykal Kilgore (The Wiz), Jonathan Lipnicki (Stuart Little), Jack Laufer (Madmen), Ivan Hernandez (Devious Maids), and Joanna Jones (Hairspray Live!). On Thursday night, a live performance of the banner song “300,000,000” will take place at The International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, Nebraska, the largest youth theatre festival in the country. An audience of 5,000 people is expected and a student choir and dancers from Bradford High School in Kenosha, Wisconsin, will also perform during the song.

371,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/12/wapo-writes-islamic-terrorism-out-of-the-pulse-nightclub-shooting/,"Shutterstock/iri Flogel The Washington Post left any mention of Islamic terrorism out of a recounting of the Pulse Nightclub shooting, referring instead to a terrorist shooting 49 people dead in the name of the Islamic State simply as “gun violence.” “A year ago, 49 people died at Pulse Nightclub,” the bizarrely passive headline on the story reads. Reporter Katie Mettler writes at length about the havoc wreaked on dozens of victims and their families in the June, 2016, attack, but makes no mention of the motivation of the Muslim terrorist responsible for the destruction. Neither Islam nor terror is mentioned once, although Omar Mateen took great pains to make his motive ultra clear. The description of the attack is even more bizarre than the headline. Mettler ascribes the religiously motivated terror rampage to a disembodied “mass shooting” that “stole 49 lives.” “It had been a year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history stole 49 lives there and scarred countless others; a year since Pulse, a safe space for Orlando’s gay community, fundamentally changed,” she writes. The person responsible for this violence placed a brief 911 call to let everyone know exactly why he had just opened fire on a bunch of people dancing in a nightclub. Let’s revisit that transcript. — “Emergency 911, this is being recorded,” the operator said. — “In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficent,” Mateen said in Arabic. — “What?” — “Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God,” he continued, then switching to English: “I wanna let you know, I’m in Orlando and I did the shootings.” — “What’s your name?” — “My name is I pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State.” — “What’s your name?” — “I pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may God protect him [Arabic], on behalf of the Islamic State.” — “Alright, where are you at?” — “In Orlando.” — “Where in Orlando?” [End of call.] Setting aside these explicit statements, as well as Mateen’s history of threatening violence based on Islam and the fact that he had been investigated by the FBI for terror ties, Mettler links the attack not to terrorism, but to police shootings that she vaguely describes as “gun violence.” [dcquiz] “By the end of the night, more than 1,000 people had gathered to remember what happened last June, when Orlando became the first U.S. city of the summer — before Falcon Heights, Minn., and Baton Rouge and Dallas — to be upended by gun violence,” she writes. Despite Mettler’s obvious attempt to wipe the story clean of any mention of Islamic terror, an accurate description of the attack did creep in through the video about the victims embedded right at the top of her story. “Remembering the victims of the Orlando terrorist attack,” the video title reads. And below is a description from a video editor: “49 people were killed at a nightclub in Orlando when a gunman who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State opened fire and took hostages. Here are the victims.” Follow Rachel on Twitter Send tips to rachel@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Orlando television station WFTV reported Monday that 20-year-old Jahqui Sevilla was driving on an Orlando-area highway early Sunday when she lost control of her car for an unknown reason. The car jumped the highway median and hit an SUV traveling in the opposite lanes head-on. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT INCIDENT: GUNMAN IN CUSTODY, 'EVERYONE IS SAFE,' COPS SAY The Florida Highway Patrol says Soraya Matias-Roth, 53, of Lakeland, Florida, who was in the SUV, also was killed and three others in the SUV were hospitalized with injuries not considered life-threatening. The highway patrol said in an accident report that the crash is still under investigation. Sevilla played for the Orlando Anarchy Women's Football team, which posted news of the death and its condolences on Facebook. ""When a person we love leaves us, we never lose them —they become more of a part of us,"" the team said on its Facebook page. ""Jahqui Sevilla will always be in our hearts and a part of the Orlando Anarchy Family."" Sevilla survived last year's Pulse nightclub massacre that left 49 people dead — the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Gunman Omar Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed in a shootout with police officers after a three-hour standoff.

City of Orlando, Florida to buy Pulse nightclub, the site of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, and convert site into a memorial New videos released Wednesday from body-cams on officers responding to the attack at a gay nightclub in Orlando show shattered glass inside the club, the sounds of automatic gunfire and an officer shouting to the gunman, ""Come out with your hands up or you will die!"" The 11 hours of video show Pulse patrons running from the club and officers shouting, ""Just go!"" as they direct them to safety across the street. In another video, an officer off camera inside the club checks for the pulse of a patron only to announce the victim is dead. Another officer later is heard in a video realizing that the massacre is an act of terrorism. ""It's terrorism in Orlando,"" the officer is heard saying of gunman Omar Mateen. ""He pledged something to the Islamic State."" The 11 hours of footage were given to the Orlando Sentinel, FOX 35 Orlando, and ABC News through a public records request initially made nearly a year ago. None of the people who died that night are shown in the newly released tapes. Forty-nine patrons were killed during the massacre on June 12, 2016, and dozens more were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers after a three-hour standoff. He pledged allegiance to ISIS during phone calls with police negotiators. Some of the body-cam footage released Wednesday shows Pulse patrons being checked for weapons by officers after escaping the club with their hands up. Other footage shows an officer leading a patron out of a bathroom and down a hallway. ""Follow the sound of my voice. Come this way,"" the officer said. One club patron was found crouched hiding in a shed and was hesitant to come out of it. ""We're police, man. Come on. Get out!"" an officer said. Read more from The Orlando Sentinel.

374,https://theintercept.com/2017/05/31/the-numbers-dont-lie-white-far-right-terrorists-pose-a-clear-danger-to-us-all/,"© First Look Institute. All rights reserved First Look Institute is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Donald Trump and other Republicans decry Islamist terror attacks in the U.S. but pay scant attention to attacks by white nationalists, such as in Portland. O Sean Duffy, where art thou? Back in February, the Republican congressman from Wisconsin told CNN’s Alysyn Camerota that white terrorists of the far-right variety did not pose the same level of danger to Americans as so-called “Islamist” or “jihadist” terrorists. Why? “I don’t know, but I would just tell you there’s a difference,” proclaimed Duffy, who went on to dismiss as a “one-off” the attack on a mosque in Quebec by a Trump-supporting white nationalist, in which six Muslim worshippers were killed. One-off? Seriously? Has Duffy been reading the news in recent days? On May 20, Richard Collins III, a black, 23-year-old U.S. Army second lieutenant, was murdered while visiting the University of Maryland by a member of a Facebook group called “Alt-Reich: Nation.” According to University of Maryland police chief David Mitchell, the group promotes “despicable” prejudice against minorities “and especially African-Americans.” Canadian security forces patrol after a fatal shooting in the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec in Quebec City on Jan. 29, 2017. Photo: Renaud Philippe/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images On May 26, 53-year-old U.S. Army veteran Rick Best and 23-year-old recent university graduate Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche were murdered, while 21-year-old poet Micah David-Cole Fletcher was severely injured, by a knife-wielding white supremacist when the three of them tried to prevent him from harassing a Muslim woman in a headscarf on their commuter train in Portland, Oregon. Why isn’t Duffy back on CNN decrying the threat posed by such vile domestic terrorists? Why aren’t the Republican political and media establishments loudly alerting voters to the white-skinned far-right menace in their midst? Can you imagine the tweetstorm from President Donald Trump if two U.S. soldiers — one serving, one a veteran — had been killed on U.S. soil by Islamist terrorists in the space of a single week? Can you imagine the rolling coverage on Fox News if it had been a ranting Muslim man who had slashed the throats of three Good Samaritans trying to protect two women on a train in Portland? For far too long, those of us who have warned of the threat from far-right, white supremacist terrorists have been accused of trying to shift attention away from the threat of ISIS and Al Qaeda — of acting as Muslim apologists. For far too long, a veritable industry of politicians, pundits, and self-styled security “experts” have strived to minimize the domestic terror threat from far-right groups while inflating the threat from foreign jihadists. Compare and contrast: Islamist terrorists are depicted as wild-eyed fanatics driven to kill by their religious faith or ideology, while far-right terrorists — be it the shooter of two Hindus in a bar in Kansas in February, or the killer of nine black worshippers in a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, or the murderer of six Sikh worshippers in a temple in Duffy’s own state of Wisconsin in 2012 — are almost always “mentally ill.” After the recent double murder in Oregon, it didn’t take long for Portland police spokesperson Pete Simpson to announce: “We don’t know if [the suspect] has mental health issues.” (Isn’t it weird how we Muslims seem somehow immune to “mental health issues”? Mashallah.) Alana Simmons leaves a message on a board in front of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church after a mass shooting at the church left nine people dead, on June 22, 2015. Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Today, the terror threat from far-right white supremacists is the terror threat that dare not speak its name. Leading conservatives, and even some liberals, are keen to downplay the danger that they pose and to divert and deflect attention away from homegrown white extremists and toward what President Trump likes to call “radical Islamic terrorism.” Yet the numbers don’t lie — even if the Islamophobes do. “Since September 12, 2001,” noted a recent report prepared for Congress by the Government Accountability Office, “the number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year. … Fatalities resulting from attacks by far-right wing violent extremists have exceeded those caused by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001.” Imagine that. The report continues: “Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since September 12, 2001, far-right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent).” That’s a margin of almost three to one. The report points out that “the total number of fatalities is about the same for far-right wing violent extremists and radical Islamist violent extremists over the approximately 15-year period,” with the latter edging out the former by 119 to 106. However, the report also acknowledges that “41 percent of the deaths attributable to radical Islamist violent extremists occurred in a single event — an attack at an Orlando, Florida night club in 2016.” Islamist terrorists, it seems, are more deadly in terms of the number of people killed in each of their attacks, yet far-right terrorists are far more active in carrying out attacks on U.S. soil. A plethora of reports and studies — from the New America Foundation to the Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point — have backed the GAO on this point. One group of researchers even found that “compared to Islamist extremists, far-right extremists were significantly more likely to … have a higher level of commitment to their ideology.” Meanwhile, U.S. law enforcement agencies, according to a survey carried out by the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security, “consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face.” Forget Congressman Duffy: These agencies won’t get much sympathy from their new Republican president either. As Reuters reported in early February, less than two weeks after Trump’s inauguration, the White House expressed a desire to “revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism … and would no longer target groups such as white supremacists who have also carried out bombings and shootings in the United States.” The news was met with glee in far-right circles. “Donald Trump,” wrote Andrew Anglin, editor of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, “is setting us free.” Why would a president who has repeatedly retweeted white supremacist Twitter accounts such as WhiteGenocideTM, appointed a white nationalist to be one of his delegates in California, accepted campaign donations from white nationalist leaders, picked a white nationalist as his chief strategist in the White House, and been officially endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan want to turn a blind eye to the domestic terror threat from white supremacists and nationalists and put American lives in danger? I couldn’t possibly imagine. Top photo: A young woman comforts a crying man outside the courtroom after Jeremy Christian was arraigned in Portland, Ore., on May 30, 2017.

Mark Follman, Gavin Aronsen, and Deanna PanUpdated: May 26, 2021, 10:45 a.m. PT In July 2012, in the aftermath of the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, Mother Jones created a first-of-its-kind open-source database documenting mass shootings in the United States. Our research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker. We exclude shootings stemming from more conventionally motivated crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. (Or in which the perpetrators have not been identified.) Other news outlets and researchers have since published larger tallies that include a wide range of gun crimes in which four or more people have been either wounded or killed. While those larger datasets of multiple-victim shootings are useful for studying the broader problem of gun violence, our investigation provides an in-depth look at a distinct phenomenon—from the firearms used and mental health factors to the growing copycat problem. Tracking mass shootings is complex; we believe ours is the most useful approach for studying this specific phenomenon.  Since we began, our interactive map below and the downloadable database behind it have been expanded with 62 additional cases from 2013-2021. Dating back to at least 2005, the FBI and leading criminologists essentially defined a mass shooting as a single attack in a public place in which four or more victims were killed. We adopted that baseline for fatalities when we gathered data in 2012 on three decades worth of cases. (It is important to note that there have been many similar indiscriminate gun rampages in public places—but resulting in fewer fatalities—that would otherwise be included in our dataset. In that regard, ours is a conservative measure of the problem.) In January 2013, a mandate for federal investigation of mass shootings authorized by President Barack Obama lowered that baseline to three or more victims killed. Accordingly, we include attacks dating from January 2013 in which three or more victims were killed. (Any analysis of the frequency of mass shootings using our database should account for this.) Our original analysis, which covers cases from 1982-2012 with four or more victims killed, follows below. The cases we’ve documented since then using the revised federal baseline reaffirm our major analytical findings. <span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”>﻿</span>&amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;gt;﻿&amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;gt; It is perhaps too easy to forget how many times this has happened. The gun massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012, another at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that August, another at a manufacturer in Minneapolis that September—and then the unthinkable nightmare at a Connecticut elementary school that December—were some of the latest in an epidemic of such gun violence over the past three-plus decades. Since 1982, there have been at least 124 public mass shootings across the country, with the killings unfolding in 36 states, from Massachusetts to Hawaii. They are occurring more often: An analysis of this database by researchers at Harvard University, further corroborated by a separate study from the FBI, determined that mass shootings have tripled in frequency in recent years. We’ve gathered detailed data on nearly four decades worth of cases, including information on the attackers’ profiles, the types of weapons they used, and the number of victims they injured and killed. [Editor’s note: The following analysis covers our original dataset comprised of 62 cases from 1982-2012.] Weapons: Of the 143 guns possessed by the killers, more than three quarters were obtained legally. They included dozens of assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns with high-capacity magazines. (See charts below.) Just as a perpetrator used a .40-caliber Glock to slaughter students in Red Lake, Minnesota, in 2005, so too did the one in Aurora, along with an AR-15 assault rifle, when blasting away at his victims in a darkened movie theater. In Newtown, Connecticut, the attacker wielded a .223 Bushmaster semi-automatic assault rifle as he massacred 20 school children and six adults. The perpetrators: More than half of the cases involved school or workplace shootings (12 and 20, respectively); the other 30 cases took place in locations including shopping malls, restaurants, and religious and government buildings. Forty-four of the killers were white males. Only one was a woman. (See Goleta, Calif., in 2006.) The average age of the killers was 35, though the youngest among them was a mere 11 years old. (See Jonesboro, Ark., in 1998.) A majority were mentally troubled—and many displayed signs of mental health problems before setting out to kill. Explore the above map and database for further details—we do not consider it to be all-inclusive, but based on the criteria we used, we believe that we have produced the most comprehensive rundown available on this particular type of violence. (Mass shootings represent a small fraction of America’s overall gun violence.)

Newly-released body cam footage gives new perspective on the deadly shooting ORLANDO, Fla. – Newly-released video from bodycams on officers responding to a mass shooting at a Florida gay nightclub shows shattered glass inside the club, the sounds of automatic gunfire and an officer shouting to the gunman, ""Come out with your hands up or you will die!"" The videos were released Wednesday to ABC News, the Orlando Sentinel and the newspaper's news partner, Fox 35. The 11 hours of video show Pulse patrons running from the club and officers shouting, ""Just go!"" as they direct them across the street. In another video, an officer off camera inside the club checks for the pulse of a patron only to announce the victim is dead. Later, an officer realizes that the massacre is an act of terrorism. ""It's terrorism in Orlando,"" the Orlando Police officer said of the gunman. ""He pledged something to the Islamic State."" Forty-nine patrons were killed during last June's massacre and dozens more were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Gunman Omar Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers after a three-hour standoff. He had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group during phone calls with police negotiators. Some bodycam footage shows Pulse patrons being checked for weapons by officers after escaping the club with their hands up. Other footage shows an officer leading a patron out of a bathroom and down a hallway. ""Follow the sound of my voice. Come this way,"" the officer said. One club patron was found crouched hiding in a shed and was hesitant to come out of it. ""We're police, man. Come on. Get out!"" an officer said.

          / CBS/AP CHARLESTON, S.C. -- The architect who designed the 9/11 Memorial in New York has been chosen to create a memorial to honor the nine worshippers gunned down in a racist shooting attack on a South Carolina church. The decision came Saturday on the second anniversary of the massacre at Emanuel AME church in Charleston - a day also marked by a crowd singing ""Amazing Grace"" as they marched to the church. Emanuel's bells rang nine times at the end of the ""Hate Won't Win Unity Walk."" The walk, which organizers said was designed to bring people of all races, religions, and backgrounds to ""contest hate and spread love across the world,"" honored the nine parishioners of the church who were killed during a Wednesday night Bible study on June 17, 2015. The message of the march, ""Hate won't win,"" could be seen on signs and heard from family and friends of the victims and survivors, CBS affiliate WCSC reports. Ashland Temoney lost her aunt, the Rev. Depayne Middleton Doctor. ""It was very meaningful today for us to come together and just show the city and the world that hate did not win,"" said Ashland Temoney, whose aunt, Rev. Depayne Middleton Doctor, was killed. ""It was meaningful to walk on this street where they last took their steps."" She told SCSC that each step was filled wtih emotion. ""Every year it feels like it is happening all over again. It's like an open wound that continues to pour out,"" she said. Last year, friends and family dedicated 15 trees on Emanuel's front lawn - one for each of the dead, the five people inside the church who survived the slaughter and one for the church's congregation. This year, plaques were placed under each tree. The white killer of the nine black worshippers is in a federal prison in Indiana after a federal jury found him guilty of hate crimes. Those 12 jurors told Dylann Roof in January he would pay with his life for the mass shooting. Roof is appealing that death sentence. More memorials are planned at the Charleston church. A prayer garden is under construction, and Michael Arad will soon begin work on the memorial that the Rev. Eric Manning, pastor of Emanuel AME, said will be a reminder of the resiliency of the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. One of the church's founders, Denmark Vesey, tried to lead a slave revolt in 1822. He was put to death and the church was burned down and closed for decades. ""If we are able to shine a light on the beauty, resiliency and love that was shown by members of this congregation and the community of Charleston, we will succeed in showing the best of humankind in the wake of the worst,"" Arad said. Emanuel AME itself is adjusting too. The church fellowship hall where Roof sat through 45 minutes of a Wednesday night Bible study before firing the first of 77 bullets as the worshippers bowed their heads for a final prayer on June 17, 2015, has termites and unpatched bullet holes, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. Some members want to totally renovate the hall because the wood-paneled walls and round white tables are a reminder of the massacre. Others, including the pastor, want it restored to look the same. No decision has been made yet. Manning, who came to Emanuel last summer, has made some changes. The Wednesday night Bible study is now held upstairs in the church sanctuary to spare members from reliving the horror every week. Dozens of visitors still come to Sunday services at Emanuel AME. The church used to welcome and individually recognize each visitor between hymns and the sermon. But after the shootings, that stretched on for so long it seemed to overshadow Manning's message from the pulpit. So now visitors are welcomed as a group with a brief word from the pastor toward the start of the service. Members then greet them with a short song: ""Emanuel, God is with us. Emanuel, in Him do we trust. We welcome you to this holy place. We welcome you with our warm embrace. We welcome you, we welcome you to Emanuel."" ""I did not want worship service to continue to be a spectator sport,"" Manning told the newspaper.  ""Some people may not agree with me, and I understand that. But my job is to protect worship.""

          / CBS/AP ORLANDO -- One of the five victims fatally shot by a disgruntled former co-worker at an Orlando awning company Monday was fearful the suspect might seek revenge for being fired, reports CBS affiliate WKMG. Police say 45-year-old John Robert Neumann, Jr. singled out and fatally shot the five victims in the head before killing himself at the sound of approaching sirens. He did not appear to belong to any type of subversive or terrorist organization, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. ""My experience tells me that this individual made deliberate thought to do what he did today. He had a plan of action,"" said the sheriff, who wouldn't say why Neumann was fired in April. Demings said Neumann had a ""negative relationship"" with at least one of his former co-workers in Orlando, and he singled out the former colleagues who were shot. Lillian Crouch, a friend of shooting victim Robert Snyder, told WKMG that Snyder was the lead manager at the factory, Fiamma Inc. Crouch said Snyder told her he fired Neumann in April over his violent tendencies, and that at the time he feared Neumann would return for revenge. Crouch said she hadn't heard Snyder mention Neumann recently. ""[Neumann was fired] because he was starting fights with people,"" Crouch said. ""[Snyder] told me about this guy that had started trouble. He started a fight with somebody."" Authorities had confronted Neumann once before at the factory, when he was accused of battering a co-worker in June 2014. But no charges were filed after both men were interviewed, and that co-worker was not among Monday's victims, the sheriff said. In a 2014 incident report, Neumann's co-worker said Neumann punched him in the back of the head when he approached, knocking him to the ground. But the co-worker later changed his story, saying Neumann had chased him and then hit him on the back of the head. The co-worker, who had no visible injuries, stated ""he had problems in the past with John but thought they were resolved,"" the sheriff's office incident report said. Friends recalled Snyder as a husband, father and grandfather who worked daily and would typically visit the Fiamma Inc. factory about twice a week. He was 69. Police identified the other four victims as Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44; Kevin Clark, 53; Jeffrey Roberts, 57; and Kevin Lawson, 46. The Lake Howell Pop Warner league, a local youth sports league, said Tuesday that they are raising money for the children of Kevin Clark, who were orphaned by the shooting. The league says on a fundraising website that the children had already lost their mother nine years ago. The league describes Clark as ""wonderful man and an absolutely amazing, supportive and wonderful father."" Clark's 14-year-old daughter was a cheerleader in the league, and his 18-year-old son played football in the league for several seasons. The shooting began after Neumann slipped through a rear door into the cavernous Fiamma Inc. factory, an area larger than two football fields where awnings are stitched together for recreational vehicles. He paused at least once to reload. Seven other workers were inside at the time but were unharmed. State and federal law enforcement officers converged on the industrial park shortly after 8 a.m. after a woman ran out and called 911 from a tile business across the street, said Yamaris Gomez, that store's owner. ""All she kept saying was he was holding a gun and told her to get out,"" Gomez said. That woman had been hired after Neumann was fired in April, so he probably did not recognize her and knew she was not a former co-worker, Deming said. Deming said investigators were looking through any social media postings for clues. Neumann was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 1999 and did not have a concealed weapons permit, the sheriff said. Neumann had a record of minor crimes, none violent, dating back more than 20 years. Most involved traffic violations: driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license, giving a deputy a false name and leaving the scene of a hit-and-run involving property damage. Searching for a motive, deputies cordoned off a trailer park in Maitland, where Neumann lived alone in a mobile home on a busy road next to a funeral home, a used car lot and a dog-grooming business. Like the awning factory, it's far from Orlando's famous theme parks. Arnie Boyd, who lives in the same trailer park, said Neumann was not particularly social. ""Every once in a while, he would ride his bike around and that's it,"" Boyd said. ""We would speak only once in a while."" Authorities had no reports of any specific threats the gunman made to people at the company or anyone else, but that's why people need to alert authorities whenever they learn of anything that could lead to violence, said Special Agent Danny Banks of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson noted that next Monday will mark a year since the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history at a gay nightclub in Orlando. The attack at the Pulse club killed 49 people and wounded dozens more. ""The city of Orlando, which is still healing from the Pulse massacre, has seen too much violence this past year,"" the Florida Democrat said in a statement.

News By Associated Press Submit May 30, 2017 | 9:26pm				| Updated May 31, 2017 | 10:52am ORLANDO, Fla. — A young woman who survived a massacre at a gay Florida nightclub has been killed in a highway car crash. Orlando television station WFTV reported Monday that 20-year-old Jahqui Sevilla was driving on an Orlando-area highway early Sunday when she lost control of her car for an unknown reason. The car jumped the highway median and hit an SUV traveling in the opposite lanes head-on. The Florida Highway Patrol says Soraya Matias-Roth, 53, of Lakeland, Florida, who was in the SUV, also was killed and three others in the SUV were hospitalized with injuries not considered life-threatening. The highway patrol said in an accident report that the crash is still under investigation. Sevilla played for the Orlando Anarchy Women’s Football team, which posted news of the death and its condolences on Facebook. “When a person we love leaves us, we never lose them — they become more of a part of us,” the team said on its Facebook page. “Jahqui Sevilla will always be in our hearts and a part of the Orlando Anarchy Family.” Sevilla survived last year’s Pulse nightclub massacre that left 49 people dead — the worst mass shooting in modern US history. Gunman Omar Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed in a shootout with police officers after a three-hour standoff.

384,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/business/sarah-palin-sues-new-york-times.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Sydney Ember Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate, filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Company on Tuesday, saying the newspaper had published a statement about her in a recent editorial that it “knew to be false.” In the lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ms. Palin contends that The Times “violated the law and its own policies” when it linked her in an editorial to a mass shooting in January 2011. The editorial was published online on June 14, the day a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where Republican lawmakers were practicing for an annual charity game. The editorial said there was a link between political incitement and the mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded Representative Gabby Giffords and said that Ms. Palin’s “political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” The Times later issued a correction, saying that there was no established link between political statements and the shooting and that the map circulated by Ms. Palin’s PAC had depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath the stylized cross hairs. The NYT Opinion Twitter account also sent out the correction about the lack of a link, apologizing and saying that it appreciated that readers had pointed out the mistake. Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit that The Times’s response “did not approach the degree of the retraction and apology necessary and warranted by The Times’s false assertion that Mrs. Palin incited murder.” In a statement, a spokeswoman for The Times said, “We have not reviewed the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously.” Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, was critically injured in the June 14 shooting.

385,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/14/congress-shooting-obamacare-repeal-239561,"""It should drive home how health care is personal, not political,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow said. | AP Photo By ELANA SCHOR 06/14/2017 07:07 PM EDT Liberal activists on Wednesday hit pause on their all-out battle to thwart Republicans trying to fast track an Obamacare repeal-and-replace plan through the Senate. But Democratic lawmakers and outside groups say the mass shooting that wounded House Majority Whip Steve Scalise can’t slow down the overall effort. Indivisible, the liberal organizer behind many of this year’s emotion-filled town hall demonstrations against GOP lawmakers, postponed a Facebook event scheduled for Wednesday night and is not pushing in-district events for Wednesday and Thursday. The group’s local chapter in the district of Scalise, who remained in critical condition late Wednesday after being shot in the hip, urged its members to forego pressure campaigns in lieu of focusing their day on supporting Scalise and his staff. “We are letting folks know that there is going to be heightened security, and they should be really conscious of the state of mind of members of Congress and their staff, which is totally reasonable,” Indivisible executive director Ezra Levin told POLITICO. “They’re being personally affected by this.” MoveOn.org, a leader in organizing against the GOP’s Obamacare repeal plans, limited its social media messaging after the shooting to a singular statement that didn’t mention President Donald Trump. “Our thoughts are w/those shot at congressional baseball practice,” the group tweeted. “Gun violence is ongoing crisis. Political violence is never acceptable.” The activists found themselves in a particularly delicate situation given that the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Ill., volunteered for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign and espoused far-left beliefs on social media, prompting an outcry from some Trump allies who blamed liberal passions for the shooting.

This sign-up form is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Sanders swiftly condemned Hodgkinson on Wednesday, lamenting his “despicable act” and declaring that “real change can only come about through nonviolent action.” But even as outside groups pulled back from public events on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers continued to push the message — gingerly — that Senate Republicans are playing a dangerous game by trying to gut Obamacare. ”I don’t know that you can ask people to take the passion out of this issue,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said of the Obamacare battle. “We all need to be better about how we treat each other and the language we use, but this is a life-and-death issue.” The shooting ""doesn't change the fact that there have been no hearings"" on the Senate GOP's Obamacare repeal plan and Democrats as well as the public have ""not seen the bill,"" said Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a member of Democratic leadership. ""Everybody who was hurt today had the opportunity to go to the hospital,"" Stabenow added, including one victim from her home state. ""It should drive home how health care is personal, not political."" One operative involved in the repeal debate, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity, said that ""generally, folks in the health care advocacy community are going to take their cue from what Republicans in the Senate are doing."" “If tomorrow morning they're holding hearings or sending a bill to [the Congressional Budget Office], you will see groups gear back up for that debate. If the Senate says, 'we're on pause,' I think people will pause."" And although the House canceled its votes on Wednesday and responded to the shooting with notable bipartisan comity, business in the Senate largely proceeded as usual — albeit with a strong show of bipartisan support for new sanctions on Russia. The Senate GOP is still pressing to hold a vote on its to-be-released health care plan as soon as this month, before members leave Washington for a week-long July 4 recess. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) agreed that the violent attack on Scalise, which also wounded a staffer, a lobbyist, and two members of Capitol Police, should serve as a reminder to turn down the volume of political rhetoric. But he noted that Republicans are doing their own part to foment division by excluding Democrats entirely from their health care process. Political sentiment ""should never have been turned up starting in 2009 and 2010,” the height of the tea party-fueled opposition to the Affordable Care Act, Manchin said. ""It’s been bad all the way through. Someone’s got to say, well, enough’s enough. It’d be a lot nicer if they’d just sit down and work with us, and we’d get a bill.""

386,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/QFaFed-UfMQ/,"On May 21, President Donald Trump stood in a vast bejeweled auditorium in Saudi Arabia’s capital and delivered a challenge to the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims: Rid your communities of extremists. “Drive them out,” he intoned. The same day, he joined Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi as the three leaders placed their hands on a glowing white orb in a ceremony to inaugurate a new counter-extremism center. In the 10 days that followed, the extremists answered with acts of killing across the planet. A suicide bomber detonated explosives at a pop concert in the British city of Manchester, killing 22 people. In Egypt, masked gunmen opened fire on a convoy carrying Coptic Christians to a monastery in the country’s Minya province. In Baghdad, ISIS militants set off a pair of bombs, targeting families queuing up for ice cream and older people collecting their pensions. In the Philippines, the government battled to regain control of the southern city of Marawi, which had been seized by gunmen linked to ISIS. Then in Afghanistan, a truck bomb killed more than 80 people on Wednesday in a central district of Kabul near the country’s presidential palace. The attack has not yet been claimed by any group, but the Taliban denies responsibility, heightening speculation of the Islamic State’s role. The global tableau of violence is beginning to look like a repeat of a campaign of attacks carried out by ISIS and affiliated groups in 2016 timed to coincide with Ramadan, a holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting and prayer. For the overwhelming majority of the world’s practicing Muslims, Ramadan is a month for reflection, for heightened spirituality, for spending time with family. Adherents of the Islamic State have identified the month as a season for killing. “The group has made it into sort of its own sick tradition to make Ramadan an especially bloody month,” says Mokhtar Awad, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. During Ramadan last year, militants carried out attacks on Istanbul’s main airport, on civilians out after dark in Baghdad, and on people in an embassy district of Dhaka. ISIS also attached its name to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Before Ramadan in 2016, ISIS spokesperson Abu Mohammed al-Adnani issued a call for attacks in western states. In May 2017, the group’s Nashir news service issued a similar call, and urging “righteous believers” to action in a message distributed over the smartphone app Telegram. Experts say it is unlikely that ISIS’ central organization based in Syria and Iraq planned the current wave of attacks, but rather that affiliates and individuals in several countries chose to mount attacks during Ramadan and in the days leading up to it. “It’s more a case of individual groups separately commemorating the month with a view to make it look like it was centrally-planned Ramadan offensive,” says Charlie Winter, a senior fellow with the International Center for the Study of Radicalization in London. The wave of attacks exposes some of the naive assumptions of the Saudi summit. The world’s governments are fighting not one monolithic extremist threat—as Trump’s speech suggested—but a loose network of groups embedded in local insurgencies around the world. Even as a U.S.-backed military coalition moves to roust the Islamic State from its central base of operations in Iraq and Syria, satellite branches of the organization in the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia reassert the group’s persistence. And lone attackers, many radicalized from afar, continue to do the group’s bloody work in Europe. The sheer number of different ISIS franchises and affiliates throughout the world present a dizzyingly complex challenge to counterterrorism efforts. The organization thrives where state institutions collapse, such as in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen, and seeks to recruit and inspire individuals—whether Muslim or non-Muslim—across the world. But it has also been successful insinuating itself into homegrown insurgencies — as in Egypt, where the group has launched a series of attacks on Coptic Christians, bombing a cathedral in December and a pair of churches on Palm Sunday. Egypt’s local ISIS affiliate began as an insurgent group based in the Sinai Peninsula, continuing a years-long struggle against the Egyptian state which neglected the local population of a province far from the capital. In years past, the organization carried out attacks that usually targeted security forces and symbols of government power. But in recent months, the organization has turned to brutal attacks on Egypt’s Christian minority in a campaign reminiscent of the sectarian warfare waged by ISIS in Iraq and Syria. According to Awad, the turn to indiscriminate sectarian killing suggests an increasingly tight adherence to ISIS’ core brand. “What we’re seeing today is them making this abundantly clear: ISIS is in different countries and has reached different countries not because a group of Iraqis and Syrians made that happen, but because there was a galvanizing brand that indigenous jihadis subscribe to,” says Awad. ISIS is behaving less like a single strategic organization, in other words, and more like a franchisor — selling its brand to radicalized individuals and small jihadi groups across the world to extend its influence. The ambition, says analyst Michael S. Smith II, the co-founder of a consultancy that has advised U.S. government officials, is to draw in a range of rival militant groups under a single banner. “This is an important feature of their larger strategic calculus when it comes to that effort to eclipse the specter of al-Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, and other groups that refuse to merge with Islamic State,” he says.

Opinion By Post Editorial Board Submit June 13, 2017 | 3:38pm From the right: Trump’s Narcissism on Display What started out as a regular Cabinet meeting quickly turned into “one of the most bizarre spectacles some have ever witnessed,” notes Jay Caruso at Red State. As reporters prepared to leave after their initial photo-op, President Trump called on his Cabinet members, who proceeded “to lavish praise on their boss” in a “nauseating display of fealty and ego-stroking.” Yet “that’s precisely what Trump wanted.” For him, “it’s still ‘The Apprentice’ and all his underlings are subjects, not people entrusted with a job to do that they’ll retain wholly on the merits.” Yes, President Barack Obama “had similar issues of wanting to be liked and respected as well as [being] the center of attention.” But why, asks Caruso, “would anybody defend the same in a Republican president?” Culture critic: Rewriting History of the Pulse Massacre This week marks the first anniversary of Omar Mateen’s massacre of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, recalls Tiana Lowe at National Review. It was a clear-cut case of a self-identified “radicalized jihadist” committing “the deadliest mass shooting in American history, directly targeting the LGBTQ+ community in the name of a murdered Islamic State militant.” Yet the media are “unhappy with this narrative.” So they’ve instead “decided to pay tribute to the barbaric murder of 49 infidels with a ‘senseless violence’ narrative” — because the truth is too “inconvenient.” Says Lowe: That kind of “willful ignorance” is not only dangerous, it also leaves us “incapable of honoring the victims” by refusing to accept this hate crime’s real motive. Foreign desk: Russia Sanctions Only Hurt Putin’s Foes The US Senate has just reached a bipartisan agreement on new sanctions against Russia in the wake of Monday’s harsh crackdown on anti-government protestors. But Leonid Bershidsky at Bloomberg wonders if sanctions advocates “realize who they are ultimately hurting.” Is it “Vladimir Putin’s repressive regime,” he asks, “or the small number of courageous Russians he is repressing?” He notes that “sanctions have been a questionable deterrent: Putin has held on to Crimea, continued backing Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine and waded into battle in Syria on behalf of President Bashar Assad.” Indeed, his regime “is far from teetering, and it’s not internationally isolated, either.” And opposition leader Alexei Navalny has suggested that sanctions are “only pushing [Putin] to dig in deeper” and toughen repression. Fact is, “the regime takes out its hatred of the West on” dissidents. Reporter: Why Religious Right Converted to Trump Donald Trump’s “conquest of the White House was fueled by the contempt of a political class that never took him seriously,” says Tim Alberta at Politico. But it’s just as much about evangelicals, who “feel marginalized in a culture that they believe no longer reflects its core values or tolerates its most polarizing principles.” Most critics of widespread evangelical support for Trump have dismissed it as “electoral opportunism devoid of any moral consistency.” But many evangelicals say “they identify with Trump because both he and they have been systematically targeted in the public square — oftentimes by the same adversaries.” And Trump has shown he knows how to express solidarity “with an audience that can relate to feeling victimized.” Moreover, Trump thus far “hasn’t just been fighting their battles — he’s winning them.” Israeli ex-envoy: Fire the UN’s Poisonous Agency The debate over why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict hasn’t been resolved usually revolves around two issues, notes Dore Gold at the Jerusalem Post: Palestinian violence and Israeli settlements. But another “critical factor” has long been ignored until last Sunday, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “called for dismantling” the UN Relief and Works Agency, which “perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem rather than solve it.” UNRWA has long “provided a breeding ground for the growth of terrorist activity” — and its 58 camps allow the refugee problem to “fester for generations.” But “you cannot resolve a conflict and perpetuate it at the same time.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Read Next There may be a method to Trump's tweeting madness Share Selection This story has been shared 45,874 times.

390,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/hYzU7BVUpfc/,"The Washington Post declined to mention any reference to “Islamic terror” in a story published Monday recounting the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando. Instead of mentioning that Islamic terrorism was the motive for the shooting, the article’s author, Katie Mettler, wrote that the Orlando massacre that left 49 people dead was a “mass shooting” caused by “gun violence.” “It had been a year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history stole 49 lives there and scarred countless others; a year since Pulse, a safe space for Orlando’s gay community, fundamentally changed,” Mettler writes. Mettler talks about how the June 2016 attack devastated the victims and their families but failed to mention Omar Mateen’s motive for carrying out the attack. Mateen, however, made his intentions known in a 911 phone call he placed with Orlando police shortly after he carried out the attack. A transcript of Mateen’s conversation with the 911 operator shows that Mateen carried out the attack in the name “of the Islamic State”: “Emergency 911, this is being recorded,” the operator said. “In the name of God the Merciful, the beneficent,” Mateen said in Arabic. “What?” the operator asked. “Praise be to God, and prayers as well as peace be upon the prophet of God,” Mateen continued in Arabic before stating in English: “I wanna let you know, I’m in Orlando and I did the shootings.” “What’s your name?” the operator asked. “My name is I pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State,” Mateen declared. The FBI also investigated Mateen for statements he made pledging his loyalty to terrorist organizations three years before the attack took place. The article does not mention the words “terror” or “Islam” at all, merely chalking off the terrorist attack as another shooting comparable to police shootings that took place later in the year. “By the end of the night, more than 1,000 people had gathered to remember what happened last June, when Orlando became the first U.S. city of the summer — before Falcon Heights, Minn., and Baton Rouge and Dallas — to be upended by gun violence,” she writes. There were some references to “terrorism” and “the Islamic State” in the caption for a video placed at the top of the article, but that has changed. The video placed at the top of the article about the victims of the Orlando attack used to say that it was an act of “terrorism” and that it was motivated by “pledging loyalty to the Islamic State,” according to an earlier piece from the Daily Caller. As of Monday evening, the video at the top of the article about the owner of the nightclub speaking about the attack includes a caption that says, “Barbara Poma, the owner of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, spoke on June 12, one year after the shooting that killed 49.” Israel / Middle EastMediaPre-ViralFloridaIslamic terrorOmar MateenOrlandoPulse night clubThe Washington Post .

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. ORLANDO, Fla. – As a law enforcement foundation reviews how the Orlando Police Department responded to a 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub, the organization's staffers say in a paper that police training and protocols may need to change. They suggest that regular patrol officers should be trained in how to respond to a terrorist attack or a hostage situation. The paper was published earlier this month by three staffers of the Police Foundation in the CTC Sentinel, a publication of the Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point. Both situations usually are handled by highly-trained SWAT team members, but the paper says patrol officers are usually the first to get to a scene. ""Routine patrol work places officers in neighborhoods where terrorists hide, plan, and attack, giving them the opportunity to gather critical intelligence as well as to identify potential threats,"" the paper says. The foundation is reviewing the Orlando police response, but it hasn't yet issued a report. The paper is separate from the group's review. The paper uses the nightclub massacre, as well as an attack in San Bernardino, California, as examples. The paper acknowledged some second-guessing in the media about why Orlando police officers didn't take out gunman Omar Mateen sooner in the Pulse nightclub mass shooting on June 12, 2016. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen was killed in a shootout with officers after a three-hour standoff. ""It should be stressed, however, that the police responding to the attack followed protocols and best practice for hostage situations,"" said the paper, noting that people can debate about whether those protocols need to change. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Orlando Police Department said the agency's policies and procedures are constantly being updated. The statement also said the agency would adjust its policies and training as needed once the foundation's review was finished.

393,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/opinion/virginia-baseball-shooting-anti-trump.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,"Advertisement Supported by By Charles M. Blow In 2011, after Representative Gabby Giffords of Arizona was gravely injured and six others were killed by a shooter in Tucson, I was moved to commit an entire column to condemning the left for linking the shooting so closely to political rhetoric. Yes, Republican personalities and officials in the wake of Barack Obama’s election had spoken openly about “Second Amendment remedies” and being “armed and dangerous” and “revolution,” but it was not possible to connect the dots between that irresponsible talk and the Tucson shooter. Now, here I am again, only this time extending the same condemnation to the right for doing the same after four people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, were shot at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field where Republican members of Congress were practicing in advance of a charity game. The shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson, appears to have had strong liberal, anti-Trump, anti-Republican views — among other things, he was a volunteer with the Bernie Sanders campaign — but at the time of this writing, authorities had not announced a motive for the shooting. The very real possibility that the shooting was politically motivated was clearly on the minds of many, including Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who was at the baseball field during the shooting: “This could be the first political rhetorical terrorist attack, and that has to stop.” Let me be clear: I don’t have a problem with viewing these incidents through a political lens. Not to do so is naïve and ridiculously self-blinding in a way that avoids reality. As Katy Waldman wrote for Slate last June: “Things that happen for political reasons, and have political consequences, demand that we scrutinize them through a political lens. Crying ‘politicization’ is itself politicization — a way to advance whatever slate of politics favors the status quo. Often people invoke policy goals in order to get things done; what’s at stake is whether these tragedies should be regarded as irreducible lightning strikes or problems with potential solutions.” What I abhor is ideological exploitation that reduces these acts to a political sport and uses them as weapons to silence political opponents and their “rhetoric,” rather than viewing them as American tragedies that we can work together to prevent through honest appraisal and courageous action. Every shooting in this country is a tragedy, and they happen with disturbing frequency here. As The Washington Post reported, Wednesday’s shooting was the 154th mass shooting so far this year in America. That’s 154 mass shootings in just 165 days. Violence, particularly gun violence, is the American fact, the American shame. This country has a violent culture, is full of guns, and our federal lawmakers — mostly Republicans, it must be said, because there isn’t any real equivalency — are loath to even moderately regulate gun access. Pretending that America’s gun violence is a function of collective political rhetoric rather than the nexus of personal mental defect and easy access to weapons is a way of dodging, well, the bullet. So, here I must take a stand in defense of rhetoric. While rhetoric should never promote violence, it needn’t be timid. I was impressed by the official responses from Washington. Even Trump’s response was sober and direct, not marred by his typical lack of tact, not like the way he tried to exploit the Pulse Nightclub shooting last year. House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a stately speech from the House floor, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi echoed his sentiments in a noble act of bipartisanship. At the top, the responses were pitch perfect, but the political debate isn’t confined to the top. It trickles down into the cesspool of social media, which has grown exponentially since Giffords was shot. At that time, Facebook had only about a third of its current number of users, Twitter had about a fifth of its current users, Instagram was just three months old, and Snapchat didn’t exist. On social media, where anonymity provides cover for vitriol, violent threats are a regular feature. When Gabby Giffords wrote on Twitter, “My heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police – public servants and heroes today and every day,” she was met with a sickening number of hateful responses, including one that said, “To bad it was not her.” (Yes, it should have been “too,” but grammar isn’t a major concern in a statement that grotesque.) It is true that political rhetoric can set a tone that greases the skids for a small number of people who are prone to violence to act on those impulses. We have just gone through a political cycle where that was on full display. But some rhetoric is necessary and real. I believe Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress are attempting to do very serious harm to the country and its most vulnerable citizens, and I will never stop saying so in the strongest terms I can summon. For many people, this isn’t an abstract policy debate between partisans. For them, these debates — about repealing the Affordable Care Act, for example — are about life and death. But that has nothing to do with the promotion of physical violence; it has everything to do with protecting this country from administrative and legislative violence. We have to object stridently to proposals that will hurt people, and not be chilled by a deranged man with a gun. Violence is abhorrent and self-defeating, but vociferous resistance to national damage has nothing to do with that violence and must continue unabated. You can, as I do, have sympathy for the victims of yesterday’s shooting and condemn the shooter, while at the same time raging, nonviolently of course, against an agenda that places other Americans in very real danger.

Andino—who goes by Kali—first met Omar in middle school in Cleveland, Ohio. “He always wanted the people around him to be happy,” she says. “He always said to live life to the fullest.” A snapchat selfie of Kaliesha Andino (left) with Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo on June 12, 2016. Courtesy of Kaliesha Andino That night out was June 12, 2016, the same night Omar Mateen entered Pulse nightclub with a handgun and semi-automatic rifle and began firing, killing 49 people and injuring 53 in what became the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Kali, who visiting the club for the first time, was shot in her back and her arm. Omar, just 20, became one of the youngest people killed. “This past year has been the hardest year of my life,” Kali says. After three different surgeries and physical therapy three times a week, she can finally move her fingers and pick up small objects again—she says she has about half the strength she had before the shooting. “The healing process has been hard,” Kali says. “It’s like you are starting all over again.” Over the course of the last year, Kali met Preston Gannaway, a photographer who has been documenting the stories of queer youth across the country, including those recovering from the Pulse attack. “For a lot of us in the broader LGBT community, it did feel really personal,” says Gannaway of the shooting. “I wanted to tell a story that showed a little bit more of the long-term effects that this was having.” Despite her difficult recovery, Kali hasn’t lost sight of her plans. “I’m still going to college and one day I want to own my own business,” she says. “What happened to me is not [going to] stop me from becoming somebody in this world.” But even as she looks forward to her own future, she mourns the dreams that Omar lost. “He wanted to become a dancer and an actor,” she says. “He was only 20. He had a bright future ahead.” Kaliesha Andino visits the grave of her friend Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo eight months after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.

396,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/12/gun-silencer-restrictions-house-jeff-duncan-239440,"Rep. Jeff Duncan has pushed to ease regulations on silencers for several years. | AP Photo By JOHN BRESNAHAN 06/12/2017 03:05 PM EDT A House committee will begin considering this week a highly controversial proposal making it easier to buy gun silencers. It’s the first such hearing to directly raise gun rights issues since President Donald Trump won the White House last year, and there is already strong opposition from gun-control groups to the measure due to the silencer provision. A number of Senate Democrats are also opposed to any such action, and they have promised to block any legislation that includes a loosening of silencer restrictions. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) included the silencer provision as part of a broader bill, the “Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act,” or SHARE Act. There are several gun-related items in the package, including the silencer language. A ""discussion draft"" of SHARE Act will be reviewed by a House Natural Resources subcommittee on Wednesday. Duncan has pushed to ease regulations on silencers for several years. A stand-alone silencer bill – called the “Hearing Protection Act” – was introduced by Duncan this January and now has 146 co-sponsors, including several Democrats.

And Duncan held a demonstration last week on gun silencers at a shooting range run by the U.S. Capitol Police in the Rayburn House Office Building. Roughly a dozen members attended the session, said a source. Duncan and other pro-gun rights lawmakers say silencers are popular with hunter and sports shooters, and he notes that 40 states allow the use of silencers while hunting. “The Hearing Protection Act has been one of the most important bills for sportsmen and women this Congress, which is why it’s common sense for it to be included in this year’s sportsman’s legislative package,” Duncan said. “By changing the outdated regulation of suppressors to an instant background check, just like the requirements to purchase a typical firearm, I hope the sportsmen and women in the United States will have greater access to noise reduction technology as they carry the hunting and recreational shooting tradition to future generations.” Under the 1934 National Firearms Act, silencers are treated similarly to machine guns and explosives. The waiting time to purchase one is far longer than for handguns or other weapons, as much as nine months or more, and buyers have to submit fingerprints and a photograph. Federal law enforcement agencies keep a record of silencer purchases. There is also a $200 transfer tax on silencers. Duncan’s proposal would eliminate those requirements, as well as refunding the $200 transfer tax to anyone who has purchased a silencer since October 2015. Gun-control groups are bitterly opposed to the Duncan legislation, saying it would make the use of silencers more prevalent and possibly cause more deadly mass shootings. The gun-control groups argue that since potential victims won’t hear gunfire, they won’t be able to protect themselves. “As Americans mark one year since the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando - the worst mass shooting in our nation's history - the gun lobby is trying to sneak a dangerous provision through Congress to make it easier for dangerous people to buy silencers,” said a statement from Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Gun Sense in America. “This provision would profit gun manufacturers while making law enforcement's job more difficult and potentially making mass shootings even more deadly.” It’s not clear if or when the broader bill may be acted on by the Natural Resources Committee. It would still likely have to get sign-off from two other House committees — Judiciary and Ways and Means — before getting to the House floor. Missing out on the latest scoops?

By SEUNG MIN KIM, BURGESS EVERETT and HEATHER CAYGLE 06/14/2017 05:58 PM EDT Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy and Dick Durbin – advocates of stricter gun laws – have spoken about the feeling of resignation for their party in the gun debate. | AP Photo One year ago, Sen. Chris Murphy sprang into action almost immediately after a gun massacre at an Orlando nightclub — accusing Congress of an “unconscionable deafening silence” and launching a 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor. But the gun-control advocate who once argued that lawmakers should put forward “legislative action within an hour of a shooting” was more circumspect on Wednesday after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in the suburbs of Washington. One tragic incident, he acknowledged, won’t move the needle — even one that affected one of their own, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.). “This is very personal. I mean, Steve is a friend of mine and frankly my time this morning has been dedicated just to making sure that my friends are OK,” Murphy said. “The way you talk certainly is affected by the fact that your priority is that the people you know are still alive.” The Connecticut Democrat continued: “We’re beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings. I mean, we don’t. We don’t. After Orlando and Sandy Hook, that’s clearly not how people’s minds work here.” The shooting Wednesday morning on a sleepy suburban baseball field — injuring Scalise and four others — horrified Capitol Hill, which has cycled through repeated rounds of tense battles over gun policy after mass shootings in recent years. But on Wednesday, the tone among even the most ardent proponents of stricter gun laws was dramatically different. In multiple interviews, several Democratic lawmakers urged that no, today was not the day to revive the dormant gun control debate. It was too soon, it hit too close to home — and lawmakers simply didn’t want to stand accused of politicizing a shooting that injured a colleague and friend. “We don’t know the facts,” pointed out Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who served as his state’s governor during the Virginia Tech shootings a decade ago. A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), who helped steer the debate over background checks as Judiciary Committee chairman in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. “People know my record … but today is not the day for that. I’m praying for the victims. I’m praying for the police officers.” “Today we need to focus on what happened and our prayers have to be with the injured,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “We can talk about other issues in the future.” Congressional Democrats have taken notably sharper and more aggressive tactics in recent years when it comes to advocating for tougher gun laws. The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando spurred the most visible action — not only Murphy’s filibuster but a sit-in led by House Democrats in the chamber that lasted more than 25 hours and captured national attention. But Democratic lawmakers tiptoed around the gun issue on Wednesday. Notably, several Democrats asked to speak without attribution for fear of being seen as insensitive so soon after one of their colleagues was shot. They acknowledged privately that if the shooting of another colleague — former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) — and the mass shooting in Newtown didn’t move the dial, this won’t either. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat and another advocate of stricter gun laws, also spoke about a “feeling of resignation” for his party in the gun debate. “Until there’s significant changes around the country or within Congress, we know each other’s positions and we know they don’t change,” Durbin said. “There’s a fatigue. We know each other’s arguments. We know what’s going to happen.” Democrats say they’re not abandoning their push for tougher gun laws, but they didn’t think it was appropriate to talk about it too quickly after Wednesday’s shooting, which occurred around 7 a.m. during the GOP lawmakers’ practice in advance of the annual congressional baseball game Thursday. In this June 16, 2016 photo, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. and other Democratic senators call for gun control legislation in the wake of the mass shooting in an Orlando LGBT nightclub. | AP Photo “I think that both sides of the aisle are going to be pretty disciplined on just focusing on [the victims] today,” Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) said. “And then tomorrow we’ll probably, hopefully respectfully, get back to the debates of what kind of policies we should have.” Even lawmakers who have seen an uptick in death threats against them recently like Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) weren’t ready to revive the gun debate. Green became the target of lynching threats after calling for President Donald Trump’s impeachment. “I think these are issues that I would feel more comfortable discussing a little bit more removed from what happened today,” he told reporters following a briefing for House lawmakers on Wednesday’s shooting. “I don’t want someone to think that I’m seizing on this as an opportunity to get into a debate that may seem political in nature.” There were other differences between shootings that prompted gun control pushes from Democrats and what happened Wednesday, such as that the massacres in Newtown, San Bernardino and Orlando were tragedies of a significantly larger scale, with upwards of dozens of fatalities. In Wednesday’s shooting, only the suspect — identified by law enforcement officials as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois — has died. Hodgkinson had often published social media posts lashing out at Trump and the GOP, stoking concern from Republican lawmakers about whether they will be targeted because of their party label. Last June, Democrats in the Senate prompted the most sweeping debate over gun policy since the aftermath of Sandy Hook, when the chamber considered restricting firearms access to those with ties to terrorism and to bolster background checks. But the deeply divided chamber rejected all four measures put on the Senate floor for a vote. Three years before that, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) teamed up on a comprehensive background checks proposal in the wake of Sandy Hook. It was ultimately filibustered by nearly all Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the Senate. On Wednesday, Manchin downplayed speculation about whether the shooting would prompt any concrete legislative action tightening rules on gun ownership. By DARREN SAMUELSOHN ""It always spurs that,"" Manchin said of a new gun control push. ""I just don't get overexcited anymore."" Another Republican who backed Manchin-Toomey — Sen. John McCain of Arizona — said Wednesday that reviving a gun debate would “be fine with me, whenever they want to.” But most other GOP lawmakers have long resisted enacting new and tougher firearms restrictions. “I own a gun; I don’t go around shooting people with it. Bottom line: People get shot, run over by cars, stabbed. It’s just a crazy world,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “If we had that debate it’d end like it always ends. We’re not going to tell law-abiding people they can’t own a gun because of some nut job.” Indeed, as legislative battles over gun policy raged in the Senate, the GOP-controlled House did not take up firearms measures on the floor, even in the aftermath of Orlando. A House panel on Wednesday had been scheduled to take up legislation making it easier to purchase gun silencers — the most significant movement on gun rights measures under the new Trump administration — but that hearing was postponed. The legislative standstill in Washington has forced supporters of additional gun restrictions to confront a difficult reality on Capitol Hill — is it even possible in this political climate to enact tougher laws while balancing constitutional rights to own firearms? “I don’t know who this person is,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said, referring to the shooting suspect. “But obviously someone who is very sick and if he had a criminal background … then yeah, shame on us. But Second Amendment is the Second Amendment.” Adam Cancryn contributed to this report. Missing out on the latest scoops?

401,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/09/sandy-hook-conspiracy-theorist-death-threats-prison,"For Leonard Pozner, who is devoted to combatting hoaxers, the sentencing is a ‘powerful outcome’ that he hopes will raise awareness of serious harm they cause Last modified on Tue 28 Nov 2017 19.23 GMT A Florida woman who believed that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school was a hoax was sentenced to five months in prison this week for threatening the father of six-year-old Noah Pozner, one of the 20 young victims who died in the shooting. US district judge James Cohn called Lucy Richards’ actions towards Leonard Pozner “disturbing” and condemned those who spread false claims about the deaths of 20 children and six adults in the attack in Newtown, Connecticut, five years ago.  “This is reality and there is no fiction. There are no alternative facts,” Cohn told Richards, 57, at her sentencing. “You have the absolute right to think and believe as you so desire,” the judge said. “You do not have the right to transmit threats to another.” For Pozner, who has become an activist devoted to combatting the conspiracy theorists that target family members of victims, the sentencing is a “powerful outcome” that he hopes will raise awareness of the serious harm that hoaxers cause. “It draws a line,” he said, “and it shows people that this is not a game that’s online, and there are actual consequences for someone who steps over the line.” Pozner has spent years using every tool at his disposal to scrub the online record of his son’s memory clean of videos suggesting that Noah and his surviving siblings and his parents are actors perpetrating a massive conspiracy against the American public. Pozner has made some progress in defending his family against these lies, but he said that countering hoaxers is still an uphill battle. Big tech companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook are doing far too little to deter the conspiracies, harassment and hatred that flourish on their sites, Pozner said. While these companies have been talking publicly about confronting fake news, “They really don’t do that much. They can be doing a lot more – especially Facebook. It really turns the other way.” He said tech companies that allow the spread of conspiracies and hatred, including Islamic State propaganda, “have blood on their hands”. Individuals are also failing in their responsibility to confront the conspiracy theorists in their own families, Pozner said. “Everyone knows someone who follows these beliefs. Everyone has a cousin or an uncle or a relative when they have family gatherings will spend time talking about this.” Most people “would just laugh it off: ‘He’s kind of a kook, he has weird beliefs, so glad we don’t have to see him till Thanksgiving or Easter’.” But these family kooks “may be hurting people, and harassing people, and spreading damaging messages. They have a responsibility to challenge them, not just to ignore it.” “The internet is not a massive multiplayer online game that is just a game,” Pozner said. “People who are on the internet then go do things in the real world.” Pozner’s six-year-old son, Noah, was murdered alongside his first-grade classmates in Newtown on 14 December 2012. Pozner’s young son was one of 20 first-graders and six educators who were shot to death in a small suburban elementary school by a troubled local man with a military-style rifle in one of the most shocking mass shootings in US history. But in the early stages of mourning their murdered children, the Pozners and other families of victims had to confront an extra burden: accusations that their children were not dead, and that the tragedy that upended their lives was all a fraud designed to undermine Americans’ gun rights. Other family members of public shooting victims have described similar harassment. Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend, 24-year-old journalist Alison Parker, was shot to death on live television, said he has received messages accusing him of being a “crisis actor” paid by the government, and claims that Parker is still alive, got plastic surgery and now lives in Israel. Richards, a 57-year-old from Florida, admitted in her guilty plea this week to being part of the active online community of Americans who believe that the Newtown shooting was staged and that the victims and their mourning family members are only actors. She admitted to sending threatening messages last year to Pozner, telling him multiple times that death was coming to him “real soon”. According to court filings, Richards was angry at a news story she had read about Pozner’s interactions with Florida university professor James Tracy, another Sandy Hook denier, who was fired after the Pozners wrote an op-ed describing him as “chief among the conspiracy theorists”, a man who had “even sent us a certified letter demanding proof that Noah once lived”. (Tracy is suing the university for wrongful termination.) In a statement that Pozner and his ex-wife, Veronique, submitted to the court before Richards’ sentencing, they wrote: “Losing a child, particularly in the manner we lost Noah, is a horrifying, life-changing event. Day after day, we wake up with the knowledge that we have to face the rest of our life without our boy. People like Lucy Richards, who torment victims of violent crime by denying and mocking their pain, are a sad reality.” “Whatever demons drove her to threaten me, she needs to be held accountable for her crime,” the Pozners wrote. “Using the internet/social media to harass/persecute others is the dark underbelly of electronic communication, and we are glad that our justice system is holding those who subscribe to this form of harassment accountable.” Court documents showed that Richards had significant mental health problems including obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, or fear of leaving one’s house, and she appeared in court in a wheelchair. An assistant to public defender Robert Berube, Richards’ attorney, said their office could not comment. Richards apologized in a statement before she was sentenced to five months in prison followed by five months of home detention. “I don’t know where my heart and head were that day, but they were not in the right place,” she said. “It was the worst mistake of my life and I am truly sorry.” Pozner said he hoped Richards’ sentence might deter some of the people dabbling in conspiracy theories online and convince them to “refocus” before they were drawn in too deeply. While he had no exact data, Pozner said he believes there are “tens of thousands” of conspiracy theorists globally who believe that mass casualty attacks such as Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon bombing and the 2012 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, are hoaxes. As more and more people join social media sites, Pozner believes the problem is growing more acute – and more people vulnerable to conspiracy theories are exposed to the “contagious addictive content” that spread hoaxes like viruses across the internet. Pozner, who once listened to InfoWars’ Alex Jones before Jones became a Sandy Hook conspiracy theorist, said that people were drawn to hoaxes for different reasons. Some “have nothing else going on in their lives and this gives them a sense of community, a sense of identity. It’s like a cult,” he said. Others are drawn to feeling “smarter” than the people around them who do not believe the conspiracy, thinking, “Oh, I’m awake – you guys are not awake.” Other people, such as the mothers of young children who spread Sandy Hook hoax theories, simply need to believe “that the world is not a fragile, unpredictable, ugly place where children can get blown up at a music concert”. The HONR Network, the organization Pozner founded to hold hoaxers accountable for their behavior, now has about 300 volunteers who help monitor hoaxer content online. It is a gruesome world to confront briefly, much less over and over again. Hoaxers, for example, will share videos of Boston Marathon bombing victims having their limbs blown off, and then debate whether the color of the blood in the footage is realistic, or look for evidence that the person in the footage whose limb was just blown off was already an amputee who is now faking a new injury. The long fight to use copyright protections to remove family photographs of Noah and his surviving children from posts full of wild conspiracies has left him frustrated at tech companies, who he said often push back or simply refuse to take down content related to his young children. “If you become the victim of a crime, shouldn’t you be protected by society somehow? Shouldn’t society hold you up when you’re kind of weakened? That’s not the case right now. If life has thrown you a curveball and you’ve been knocked to the ground, YouTube and Google and Facebook think that others should be allowed to kick you while you’re down as much as they like, and they’ll protect those people’s right to kick you.” Tech companies have little incentive to take down content that they can advertise against – even when the content is false and harmful, he said. “It’s business, and these videos and posts are content.” “Young people – they see this and they read it and because it’s allowed to remain online they have this idea, maybe there’s truth to it.” While he sees it as positive that tech companies are beginning to acknowledge concerns about the use of their platforms to spread lies and hate, their efforts so far are “just placating everybody. They’re not really doing anything,” he said. Facebook’s attempt to give users a way to flag fake news stories “feels like one of these walk buttons on a busy street that doesn’t do anything when you push it”.

Division on Trump and Russia probe - Is this your current address? RELATIVELY DEADLYOne of the most comforting – and therefore most common – conceits of the defeated is that the other guys only won because they played dirty. This view not only relieves us of responsibility, but it actually makes our loss a marker of virtue, and, in situations of sufficient gravity, martyrs. “Sure, I coulda won, if I wanted to cheat like those bums.” Such self-consolations usually produce limited harm. We might not rightly identify our own shortcomings and thereby fail to mature or improve, e.g.: Just because the Patriots had floppy footballs doesn’t mean that the Steelers’ secondary was up to scratch.  But that’s a problem with every kind of excuse making. The conceit of virtuous defeat, however, also holds within it one of the greatest ethical perils of them all: moral relativism, e.g.: If the Patriots deflate their footballs then the Steelers would be entitled to place a bounty on injuring Tom Brady. If we set limits on our own conduct based on our perceptions of the conduct and motives of others, things can get pretty bad pretty quickly. If we justify our actions based on the conduct of our foes, of whom we are naturally given to assume the worst, even long-held and near universal mores can quickly fall away. And as is the case with its cousin martyrdom, reflexive moral relativism intensifies with the gravity of the issue at hand. Imagine that the issue was the very survival of yourself and your family. Imagine your entire civilization or faith was at stake. It was fitting that one of the amusements of social media in 2016 was the moral conundrum: “Would you kill baby Hitler?” The premise is that if you were transported back to 1890, would you kill the adorable, blameless, year-old little Adolf. The ethical test hinges on the idea, of course, that the murder of an innocent baby would save the lives of tens of millions in the Holocaust and World War II. It’s like “The Terminator,” but for the good guys. What made the question interesting is the same thing that made last year’s election so terrible. With both sides convinced that the very future of the republic, nay, the human race, was at stake, otherwise decent people excused and even engaged in abominable behavior. The binary nature of American politics often creates cascades of relativistic morality, but 2016 was the Niagara Falls of downward definitions of deviancy. Worse still, we are still falling. There was a sniff of moral superiority among some conservatives over what appears to have been the attempted assassination of a group of Republican lawmakers at the hands of the definitive wild-eyed liberal. Critics on the right said the attempted murders were of a piece with the increasing intolerance of the American left: shouting down dissenting voices, protests turned riots and artistic depictions of the assassination of the president. And conservatives have a very good point to make. If you really believed that Republicans were intentionally killing tens of millions by cutting health insurance subsidies or that the president was in league with our Russian foes to topple the government from within, would taking a life really be so extreme? Unhinged rhetoric may feel cathartic to otherwise rational people, but it sounds rational to the unhinged. And then, the weekend brought us the next depredations: The murders of Muslim worshipers leaving Ramadan services in London and Virginia. Surely if those on the right are correct to talk about how rhetoric can lead to attempted murder from the left, then those on the left certainly have a fair point to make here. We don’t know enough to reach definitive conclusions on motives, but surely the sheer volume of dehumanizing anti-Muslim sentiment is worth a look. Also over the weekend, supporters of the president took it upon themselves to try to stop performances of William Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” in which the title role is portrayed an aspiring dictator made to look like the current American chief executive. The reason given for the uncivil and intolerant behavior by the protesters is that it is time for the right to adopt the methods of the left. If liberal protesters are going to shout down opposing voices, then conservatives must do the same or face annihilation. These are people who believe that the very existence of their culture is dangling by a thread, the same kind of sentiment that might, for instance, prompt someone to try to take the lives of opposing lawmakers or adherents of a faith said to be bent on the subjugation of the West from within. Why not pluck some bad Skittles out of the bowl? Again, what sounds satisfyingly extreme to the otherwise rational might sound rational to the extremist. And down we plunge… THE RULEBOOK: SOUND FAMILIAR “But [restraining legislative authority] is an evil infinitely less likely to attend us in a united than in a disunited state; nay, it may be safely asserted that it is an evil altogether unlikely to attend us in the latter situation.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 26TIME OUT: ABSOLUTELY CORRUPTED?Atlantic: “If power were a prescription drug, it would come with a long list of known side effects. It can intoxicate. It can corrupt. It can even make Henry Kissinger believe that he’s sexually magnetic. But can it cause brain damage? … The historian Henry Adams was being metaphorical, not medical, when he described power as ‘a sort of tumor that ends by killing the victim’s sympathies.’ But that’s not far from where Dacher Keltner, a psychology professor at UC Berkeley, ended up after years of lab and field experiments. Subjects under the influence of power, he found in studies spanning two decades, acted as if they had suffered a traumatic brain injury—becoming more impulsive, less risk-aware, and, crucially, less adept at seeing things from other people’s point of view. Sukhvinder Obhi, a neuroscientist at McMaster University, in Ontario, recently described something similar. … Which gives a neurological basis to what Keltner has termed the ‘power paradox’: Once we have power, we lose some of the capacities we needed to gain it in the first place.” Flag on the play? - Email us atHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions. SCOREBOARDTrump net job-approval rating: -17.4 pointsChange from one week ago: +0.8 pointsDEMS SWEAT GEORGIA SPECIAL ELECTIONPolitico: “Democrats are closer than they ever could have imagined to winning a House seat in the Republican suburbs of Atlanta, and dealing a resounding blow to Donald Trump. But they’re also gripped by anxiety about what happens if they fall short Tuesday. A loss in Georgia’s special election here could leave the party demoralized, with little to show for all the furious organizing, fundraising and spending in a handful of congressional special elections in the early months of the Trump administration. As a result, Democrats are now straining to throw everything they have at Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District to push Jon Ossoff over the top against Republican Karen Handel, aiming to prove they can win the suburban districts that may pave the way to a House majority in 2018. … But behind closed doors, operatives and lawmakers expect a withering round of internal second-guessing if they come up short after pumping enough money into the pro-Ossoff effort to make it the most expensive congressional race ever.”Ossoff, Handel condemn TV ad that ties Democrats to Scalise shooting - AJC:“Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel strongly condemned an attack ad that surfaced Sunday accusing the ‘unhinged left’ of endorsing violence against Republicans days before the nationally-watched race to represent Georgia’s 6th District is decided. The ad, funded by a little-known group called the Principled PAC, opens with sounds of gunshots and footage of U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise being wheeled away on a stretcher after he and other members of the Republican congressional baseball team were ambushed by a lone gunman while practicing in a Washington suburb. … A spokeswoman for Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, called the video ‘disturbing and disgusting’ in a statement that stopped short of asking for the ad to be removed.”Stakes high in S.C. 5th congressional district race - Charleston Post Courier: “A pair of wealthy businessmen have spent weeks hawking different perspectives of the president's policies to voters across the 11 northern and central South Carolina counties that make up the state's 5th congressional district. Voters there will make their choice Tuesday. … [Ralph Norman], a longtime member of the S.C. Legislature, emerged from a crowded Republican field by running a campaign imitating the ultra-conservative, anti-tax policy positions of Mick Mulvaney, who left the congressional seat to become Trump's budget chief. … Democrat Archie Parnell, a former attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and business manager with Goldman Sachs, made his best pitch Thursday to members of the Military Order of the Purple Heart at the Logan's Roadhouse in Sumter…”Where the cash is coming from in Ga. and S.C. special elections - Roll Call: “… a vicious political battle is underway for Georgia’s 6th District. Groups hoping to influence the election have spent nine times more money attacking the candidates than they have running positive ads… The parties’ congressional arms have led the scorched-earth battle, each dropping roughly $5 million in the district since the primary. … Meanwhile, in South Carolina… isn’t seen as the same kind of fertile ground for Democrats to pick up a GOP-leaning seat. … Norman has outperformed Parnell in fundraising by about 70 percent, though neither has brought in anything close to the amounts raised in Georgia. Also different than the Georgia race: Most of the money donated to Norman and Parnell has come from within their home state.” Is moderation making a comeback? - Maybe so, says Josh Kraushaar. National Journal: “At a time when ideo­lo­gic­al po­lar­iz­a­tion is near all-time highs, two of this year’s most vis­ible politi­cians—one Re­pub­lic­an, one Demo­crat—are run­ning prag­mat­ic cam­paigns de­signed to ap­peal to sub­urb­an mod­er­ates. Os­soff has a good chance to win a closely watched spe­cial elec­tion next Tues­day spe­cific­ally be­cause he’s avoided the highly charged anti-Trump rhet­or­ic of na­tion­al Demo­crats.”GOP CONSIDERS CANCELLING AUGUST RECESSThe Hill: “Alarmed by the stalemate on healthcare reform, lack of progress on tax reform and appropriations bills that are far behind schedule, Republican lawmakers across Congress are increasingly willing to consider cancelling the month-long August recess. Senate Republican negotiators reported that they are not close to a deal on healthcare reform and that scheduling a vote by July 4, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pushed, is likely unrealistic. That impasse has held up work on a budget resolution, which is necessary to move tax reform and the annual appropriations bills. Once Republicans vote on a budget resolution for 2018, it will wipe out the special vehicle they plan to use to pass healthcare reform with a simple majority vote — a vehicle that was set up by the budget resolution for 2017. Lawmakers calculate there are only 45 legislative days until the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30.”Democrats use Trump ‘mean’ comment to tar GOP - Politico: “Democrats are seeking to capitalize on President Donald Trump calling the Republican health care bill ‘mean’ ahead of the Senate's vote to repeal Obamacare, seeing it as a pivotal moment in an issue that could drive the 2018 midterm elections. The comments from Trump, made privately to senators last week, were largely overshadowed by a mass shooting at a Congressional baseball practice and new developments in the special counsel's investigation into Trump and his associates.

Media By Julia Marsh and Kaja Whitehouse Submit June 27, 2017 | 6:36pm				| Updated June 27, 2017 | 7:31pm Former Governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is suing the New York Times for defamation over a recent editorial tying one of her political action committee ads to a 2011 mass shooting that severely wounded Arizona Democrat Gabby Giffords and killed six people, including a 9-year-old girl​, The Post has learned​. The Manhattan federal court lawsuit, filed Tuesday by lawyers Kenneth Turkel, Shane Vogt and S. Preston Ricardo, accuse​s​ the Gray Lady of having “violated the law and its own policies” when it accused her — in a “fabricated story” — of inciting the 2011 attack by Jared Lee Loughner. Palin, who emerged on ​​the national political scene as running mate to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, is seeking damages in an amount to be determined by a jury at trial. The lawsuit is in direct response to The Times’ controversial June 14th editorial about the shooting of Representative Steve Scalise paper, which accused Palin of “political incitement” ahead of the 2011 shooting. The paper said Palin incited th​​e shooting, which left ​congresswoman ​G​abby Gifford​s​ with a severe brain injury, through an ad from her PAC that put “Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.” In fact, the ad never put Giffords or any other individual in the cross hairs — forcing the newspaper of record to issue an embarrassing correction. The correction, posted on June 16th, admitted that The Times “incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting.” The map “depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs,” the correction said. see also

The Gray Lady’s correction also admitted that the editorial “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.” “In fact, no such link was established,” the paper conceded. “We have not seen the claim yet but will defend against any claim vigorously,” a spokeswoman for The Times told The Post. It’s unclear whether the shooter ever saw or knew of Palin’s map. Investigators later said Loughner, who is serving a 140-year sentence for the mass murder, became fixated on the lawmaker well before Palin entered the picture. He expressed frustration with Gifford as early as 2007 when he met her at a constituent event and felt she gave an unsatisfactory answer to a question he asked, according to reports. “Mrs. Palin brings this action to hold The Times accountable for falsely stating to millions of people that she, a devoted wife, mother and grandmother, who committed a substantial portion of her adult life to public service, is part of a pattern of ​’​lethal​’​ politics and responsible for inciting an attack that seriously injured numerous people and killed six, including a nine-year-old girl who, at that time, was the same age as Mrs. Palin’s youngest daughter,” the lawsuit ​reads. Palin’s lawsuit also blasted The Times for not having “acknowledged that Mrs. Palin did not incite a deranged man to commit murder.” “The Times should have apologized to Mrs. Palin,” she added.

406,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/15/nbc-postpones-carmichael-show-mass-shooting-episode-virginia-attack,"Following Wednesday’s attack on congressional Republicans the episode, which dealt with the aftermath of a mass shooting incident, has been replaced Last modified on Mon 23 Apr 2018 10.35 BST NBC has decided to postpone an episode of The Carmichael Show, which dealt with a mass shooting, after congressional Republicans were targeted by a gunman on Wednesday in Virginia.  The episode, called Shoot-Up-Able, which was due to air on Wednesday night, was replaced by one called Lesbian Wedding, which was slated for 28 June. According to promotional material for the episode, it would have focused on lead character Jerrod Carmichael’s “fights against being labeled a victim after surviving a shooting”. Carmichael didn’t agree with the decision. Appearing on Chelsea Handler’s talk show, he said: “What it says is you don’t think that America is smart enough to handle real dialogue.” It is not the first time a television episode has been postponed in the wake of a shooting. Following the murder of two journalists in Virginia in 2015, USA Network postponed the season one finale of Mr Robot. At the time, the network released a statement explaining that the episode “contains a graphic scene similar in nature to today’s tragic events in Virginia”. It was postponed until the following week “out of respect to the victims, their families and colleagues and our viewers”. The same network also delayed the launch of its sniper-themed show Shooter after a gunman killed five police officers in Dallas in 2016. The Carmichael Show has become known for its tackling of controversial issues, and earlier this year turned heads when creators announced an episode where “nigger” would be used six times in an attempt to critique the taboo surrounding the word. Wednesday’s shooting in Alexandria, Virginia – which preceded a second attack at a UPS facility in San Francisco – was carried out by 66-year-old James Hodgkinson, a home inspector from Illinois who was killed in a subsequent shootout with police. House majority whip Steve Scalise, along with a lobbyist, congressional aide and two Capitol police officers, sustained injuries in the attack. On Thursday morning, Scalise was reported to be in critical condition before undergoing a third operation at MedStar Washington hospital center. NBC was not available for comment but it is believed no decision on when the episode will air has been made yet.",2017-06-15 13:16:56,NBC postpones Carmichael Show episode in wake of Alexandria attack,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

ORLANDO, Fla. – Church bells will toll throughout the Orlando area as residents reflect on the 49 patrons killed during a massacre at the gay nightclub Pulse in the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Starting in the early hours Monday, and continuing almost 24 hours later, survivors, victims' families, city officials and central Florida residents will remember the victims with four services. The first service is closed to the public, and it's being held at the nightclub for survivors, local officials and club employees. It will overlap with the exact time that gunman Omar Mateen began firing shots — a little after 2 a.m. on June 12, 2016. It is followed by another midday service at the nightclub, and an evening gathering in the heart of downtown Orlando. A final, music-filled late-night service is being held at the nightclub. Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during the attack and was eventually killed by police during a shootout after a three-hour standoff. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court, and she has pleaded not guilty to helping her husband. On Monday, local churches throughout Orlando have arranged for church bells to ring simultaneously, 49 times at noon. Local officials also have declared the one-year mark as a day of ""love and kindness,"" and they are encouraging residents to volunteer or perform acts of compassion. An exhibit of artwork collected from memorial sites set up around Orlando after the massacre will be shown at the Orange County History Center, and a giant rainbow, gay-pride flag will be unveiled at the Orange County government building. Not all the survivors planned to attend the events, saying it would be too difficult. ""There's going to be so many things going on that I feel it will be overwhelming for those affected,"" said Ricardo Negron, who managed to escape the club without physical harm after the shooting started. Demetrice Naulings said he would likely go to some of the commemorative events but he wasn't looking forward to it. Naulings also escaped from the club but lost his best friend, who was fatally shot. ""Seeing all of the other people from the club, I'm pretty sure the hugs will be teary. I'm not looking forward to that,"" Naulings said. ""I'm not looking for 'I'm sorry.' I feel like that doesn't help me. I feel like that is pity and I don't want pity.""

409,https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/active-shooter-at-republicans-congressional-baseball-practice,"Updated 10:00 p.m. | House Majority Whip Steve Scalise remains in critical condition and will need additional surgeries beyond what he underwent Wednesday after he was shot in the early morning by a gunman who opened fire at the Republicans’ congressional baseball practice. “Scalise sustained a single rifle shot to the left hip. The bullet traveled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding,” said the statement from MedStar Washington Hospital Center. He was transported “in shock” to the hospital, a Level I trauma center, the statement continued. Scalise “underwent immediate surgery, and an additional procedure to stop bleeding,” according to the statement, which also reported that he had received multiple units of blood transfusion, was in critical condition, and “will require additional operations.” In all, authorities reported that five people were wounded. In addition to Scalise, Zack Barth, a staffer for Texas Rep. Roger Williams, and Matt Mika, a former staffer who is now the director of government relations for Tyson Foods, were shot in the attack. Capitol Police officer Krystal Griner, part of Scalise’s security detail, reportedly was shot in the ankle and another officer protecting  Scalise, David Bailey, was treated for minor shrapnel injuries at a hospital and released. President Donald Trump announced later that the shooter died in hospital from injuries sustained in a shootout with officers. The gunman was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois. Speaking to the House chamber later in the afternoon, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said “there are very strong emotions throughout this House today.” “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,” Ryan said before members of the House on both sides of the aisle stood and cheered while applauding.  Barth, a legislative correspondent for Williams, later posted on Facebook that he was OK. Mika was described to Roll Call as a former Hill staffer who continued to work out with the team, helping fill out practice. “He has been taken to a local hospital and we’re awaiting word on his condition. Matt has worked for Tyson Foods for more than six years and we’re deeply concerned about him and his family,” Tyson Foods said in a statement. Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg said at a subcommittee hearing Wednesday that Mika was a former staffer of his and “became like a third son” to him. Walberg said Mika was in grave condition and is undergoing surgery. Texas Rep. Joe L. Barton, the GOP’s team manager, said there were 22 members at the practice. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks was taking swings in the batting cage Wednesday when he heard the shooter open fire — and briefly caught a glimpse of him. “I heard this loud ‘Blam,’” the Republican congressman told reporters. “I thought it was a car backfiring or something.” “I saw it was a rifle sticking through the chain-link fence, or right up next to the chain-link fence as the shooter was shooting away,” Brooks said. “It took two, three, four, five shots for me to recognize the danger and the precarious position I was in because I was real close to it.” Brooks earlier told CNN Scalise was hit as he stood near second base and he watched him crawl into the outfield as the other players and coaches hit the ground. “There was a blood trail about 10 to 15 yards long from where he was shot to where he crawled into right field,” he said. Owen Britton of Alexandria was in the nearby YMCA gym during the shooting. There were five or six people in YMCA lobby during the shooting. Britton said one bullet went through a window of the building. He saw a man outside crouched behind a wooden structure with an “AK-47 type weapon.” Britton said the shooter exchanged fire with someone crouched down behind a black SUV firing over the hood. A man was lying on the ground between the wheels of the SUV. He later saw the suspect handcuffed and lying on the ground. Sen. Bernie Sanders said on the Senate floor Wednesday that he was “sickened” to learn that Hodgkinson, the gunman, was a onetime volunteer for his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year. The Vermont independent called the shooting “a despicable act.” Earlier, FBI special agent Tim Slater said it’s too early to tell if the lawmakers and staff were “targeted or not.” He initially said it was “not an assassination attempt” but later said authorities weren’t sure as yet and that he misspoke. “No, not aware of that at all,” Slater said, when asked if it was politically motivated. Capitol Police Chief Matthew R. Verderosa said it was his “understanding” that his officers engaged the suspect. Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown called the shooting “an isolated incident.” Barth, a staffer with Williams, one of the team’s coaches, was among those shot, according to a release put out by the Texas Republican. Barth, a legislative correspondent, later posted on Facebook that he was OK. Zachary Barth, a staffer for GOP Rep. Roger Williams of TX, posted on FB that he was shot but is “okay.” Gave permission to post thru friend pic.twitter.com/ruUuNrtqn6 — Jon Ward (@jonward11) June 14, 2017  Williams hurt his ankle amid all the chaos and was put on a stretcher, a source told Roll Call. He was not shot by the gunman.  Williams tweeted that Barth is expected to make a full recovery. I now can confirm that Zack Barth, who is a legislative correspondent in my office, was shot this morning at baseball practice — Rep. Roger Williams (@RepRWilliams) June 14, 2017  Williams said he likely hurt his ankle, foot and leg when he dove into a dugout amid shots being fired. He said he would be coaching behind third base during the game. He said he’s gotten treatment to let him still participate in the game before he sees his own doctors in his home district. “They have got me going enough to play the game,” Williams said of his treatment. Williams said Wednesday evening that Barth has been released from the hospital. He said Barth was texting while shots were being fired to let people know they were under fire and needed help. Williams said he believes the first shot members heard was aimed at Trent Kelly, who was on third base. As the shooting began, Brooks said he and a few others took cover behind the batting cage tarp before scurrying to the other side of the field and diving into the first-base dugout for cover, where Brooks and a staffer unlooped their belts and applied a tourniquet to one of the victims who’d been shot in the leg. As they lay prone in the first-base dugout, one of the Capitol police officers who’d been wounded by the shooter’s gunfire opened fire toward the third-base dugout, where the shooter had holed up. “We were taking batting practice. I was at short stop. Trent Kelly was at third and I heard a gunshot and I yelled to Trent, ‘That was a gun!’” Alabama Rep. Gary Palmer told Roll Call. “And Trent looks over, he says, ‘It’s a shooter.’” “I think the guy shot at Kelly and missed him. And then he shot again and I started running in and I saw Scalise go down. We took cover and and that’s probably even much it,” Palmer said. Palmer said he ran off the field and “a bunch of us took cover behind that big oak.” “And then Scalise’s security detail said the guy was moving around that side,” he said. “We took cover behind the big block building.” Palmer said all players gave a police report. “And I called my wife to let her know I was OK,” he said. Speaking to reporters later, Brooks repeatedly praised the actions of the Capitol Police officers who stopped the shooter and mitigated the carnage. “For the grace of God, and the aim of … our Capitol Police officers shooting back, you know, I’d be with Steve Scalise in a hospital someplace along with some of our other people,” Brooks said. The Capitol Police were present in a Suburban SUV parked outside the field’s fence at practices because they travel with Scalise. “All we would have had is baseball bats against a riffle,” Brooks said. Brooks tweeted about the shooting later Wednesday morning. Praying for those injured at this morning’s practice. I’m especially thankful to the US Capitol Police who risked their lived to protect us. — Mo Brooks (@RepMoBrooks) June 14, 2017  At the Democrats’ baseball practice, which takes place at the same time at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., there is no Capitol Police presence. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who was in the batting cages at the time the shooter opened fire, told CNN he was in a “lucky spot.” “I was at the home plate batting three minutes before then and I was getting ready to leave, sometimes I give Sen. [Jeff] Flake a ride home,” Paul recalled. “[Flake] said, ‘Are you ready to go?’ and I said, ‘I’m going to go one more time at the batting cage.’” The Kentucky Republican said he was able to get out of the fence. There is one fence opening point to the parking lot and one by Scalise’s security detail to get out of the area. Paul estimated 50 to 60 shots were fired between the gunman and police. “Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. They saved everybody’s life,” Paul told CNN. Trump’s initial statement said the victims were in his thoughts and he called Scalise “a true friend and patriot” on Twitter. “The Vice President and I are aware of the shooting incident in Virginia and are monitoring developments closely. We are deeply saddened by this tragedy,” Trump said in the statement. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2017  Current and former lawmakers also responded. Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a mass shooting assassination attempt in 2011, said on Twitter that her “heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police – public servants and heroes today and every day.” My heart is with my former colleagues, their families & staff, and the US Capitol Police- public servants and heroes today and every day. — Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) June 14, 2017  “I’m shocked. I’m grieved. I’m numb,” Nebraska GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry told Roll Call at the Capitol. “Steve Scalise is a close friend of mine.” “All of us receive the aggressive comments,” Fortenberry said. “The aggressive nature of the political environment now is one thing, but when it spills over to violence against a fellow member or anyone in society, it’s just very hard to process.” The team practices at E. Monroe Ave. in Alexandria, Virginia. Simpson Field is at the heart of an athletic and recreation complex in the heart of a residential and commercial block in Alexandria. Alexandria area schools are currently closed, according to MSNBC. “I was out walking my dog and then they condoned of my neighborhood,” said Ann Shackleton, a local resident. “The only reason I’m here is because I’m trying to get home.” She said she did not hear the shots. Capitol Police were showing a more enhanced security posture at the Capitol in the wake of the Alexandria shooting. Officers  near the South Door on the House side said they knew little about the situation but were on enhanced guard. Two of three officers wielded AR-15 automatic rifles. Only members being allowed to enter Capitol building from outside. Staff, including press, being redirected to office buildings. The Congressional Baseball Game is scheduled to be played on Thursday. “There was discussion about it, I don’t know,” Brooks said on CNN when asked if the game would still be played. “I don’t think a decision was made, it’s a real shame.” Thursday’s game is in honor the victims of the Manchester and London terror attacks and British Ambassador Nigel Kim Darroch is slated to throw out the first pitch, HOH reported on Monday.

Bill Nelson said the terrorist’s intent to create an atmosphere of fear and division into Orlando and the rest of the nation instead caused 'the opposite effect.' | AP Photo By SERGIO BUSTOS 06/12/2017 07:55 PM EDT Florida's two senators, Sen. Bill Nelson and Sen. Marco Rubio, each took to the Senate floor on Monday to mourn and memorialize the 49 victims of victims of last June's Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando. Each recalled personally witnessing not only a city's grief but the outpouring of unity following a tragedy that befell the nation. ""It was a massacre of huge proportions,"" said Nelson. ""It was done by a terrorist, and what terrorists want to do is they want to divide people, they want to terrorize them, they inject fear."" But Nelson said the terrorist’s intent to create an atmosphere of fear and division into Orlando and the rest of the nation instead caused “the opposite effect,” saying that the horrific act of violence against innocent victims brought people together. “It has unified people,"" Nelson said. ""It has unified the community like I have never seen before. It has unified our state. Indeed, it has unified our nation. And so quite the opposite effect has happened from what the terrorist intended."" Rubio, also speaking on the U.S. Senate floor Monday, said “the attack may have succeeded in sowing death and heartbreak, [but] failed in sowing doubt about our way of life.” “And a year later, we remember [the victims] and those they left behind,"" he sad. ""And I hope we will honor them by finding a way as a nation to remember that, despite our differences on a vast number of issues, we are still one nation, under God. The greatest nation on earth. The most extraordinary people to have ever lived.” Nelson and Rubio co-sponsored a resolution to honor the 49 victims of what is the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Authorities say on June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old security guard, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a terrorist attack/hate crime inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Mateen was shot and killed by police following a three-hour standoff. The club was hosting Latin Night and many of the victims were Puerto Rican. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Read the U.S. Senate resolution co-sponsored by Nelson and Rubio here.

411,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/republican-baseball-shooting-virginia-what-happened?CMP=share_btn_tw,"In a rampage lasting 10 awful minutes, a gunman targeted Republican politicians as they held an early-morning practice in a picturesque park Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 17.59 BST America has been made to endure this pain before, when a mass shooting has desecrated its most cherished spaces: a schoolroom in Newtown; a cinema in Aurora; a church in Charleston. This time, with the dawn, a baseball park in Virginia became, in the words of Senator Rand Paul, “a killing field”.  What politicians who trade their suits and ties for baseball uniforms lack in fitness, they make up for in earnest enthusiasm. Such is the dedication of Steve Scalise, the No 3 House Republican, and his colleagues that they regularly start practice at 6.15 or 6.30am at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, across the Potomac river from Washington DC. This allows them to beat the heat, which was heading towards 90F(32C) on Wednesday, and the clamour of Capitol Hill. Their surroundings are a serene, affluent area of detached redbrick houses with porches, clipped lawns and trees where trouble is hard to imagine. The baseball field is close to the park where local people walk their dogs, a children’s playground and a YMCA. It lies about halfway between Washington DC to the north and George Washington’s farm, Mount Vernon, to the south. There were 20 House members and two senators present, according to the congressman Joe Barton of Texas, the Republican team’s manager, grabbing the last chance to hit some balls before Thursday’s annual charity game against their Democratic rivals. Just after 7am, a man who would be identified later as James Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Illinois, walked up to two congressmen, Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, as they were getting into their car to leave the field, the pair recalled. Duncan told reporters that the man had “asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or Republican team. I told him they were Republicans. He said, ‘OK, thanks,’ turned around.” Minutes later, as the dedicated amateurs were nearing the end of batting practice, there was a loud bang. They stopped and stared, puzzled. Rodney Davis of Illinois said later that he thought something heavy had dropped at a construction site. “He’s got a gun!” someone shouted. Another person yelled: “Hit the ground!” One of the most vivid accounts would come from Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman. “I was on deck, about to hit batting practice on the third-base side of home plate, and I heard a loud ‘bam’, and I look around and behind third base and the third base dugout, which is cinderblock, I see a rifle,” he told CNN. “And I see a little bit of a body and I then hear another ‘blam’ and I realise that there’s an active shooter.” Hodgkinson, wearing jeans and blue shirt, was wielding a rifle from behind a chain-link fence near third base. By most estimates, he would fire at least 50 rounds, the bullets kicking up earth and gravel. There was pandemonium. Brutally exposed on the open field, people variously hit the deck, dived into a dugout for cover, raced into the dog park or jumped over a fence and ran for their lives. The team manager Joe Barton’s 10-year-old son Jack hid under an SUV. Mike Bishop of Michigan told the New York Times: “He was hunting us at that point. There was so much gunfire, you couldn’t get up and run. Pop, pop, pop, pop – it’s a sound I’ll never forget.” Hodgkinson kept firing as he moved from near the third-base dugout towards the backstop behind home plate. He never got on to the field because the chain-link fence around the park was locked. Barton said later: “Had he gotten in the fence, it would have been a bloodbath.” The Texas congressman Roger Williams, who coaches the Republican team, added: “We were sitting ducks. We had nothing to fight back with but bats, if it came to that.” The first victim was Scalise, 51, who had been fielding balls on second base. He was hit in the hip and collapsed to the ground, screaming. He managed to drag himself to the outfield grass, leaving a trail of blood, witnesses said later. Two Capitol Hill police officers, Crystal Griner and David Bailey, who were in Scalise’s security detail, immediately returned fire. Senator Jeff Flake yelled: “Are you friendly? Are you friendly?” One shouted back: “Yes!” One of the officers suffered a gunshot wound but kept firing. Both were widely praised for saving numerous lives. An Alexandria resident, Katie Fillus, told the Washington Post she saw a female officer pull out a gun and scream, “Drop your weapon!” but the gunman shot her. “She fell on the ground in front of us, and we were all just trying to lay as flat we could. And I belly-crawled, dragging through the mud. I got to the car and I ducked under the car and I laid as close as I could under the car to hide from the person. Then the police seemed to come.” Brooks, meanwhile, had thrown himself down at home plate, but decided to take a chance and run to the first base dugout, where about a dozen congressmen and aides were lying. Among them was congressional aide Zachary Barth, who had been struck in the leg and hobbled across the field. Brooks took off his belt and another congressman applied a tourniquet to try to slow the bleeding. “In the meantime,” Brooks told CNN, “I’m towards the right-field side of the dugout and there’s gunfire within about five, six, seven feet of my head, and I look up and there’s a guy with a gun blasting away. Fortunately, it was one of the good guys, one of our security detail, who was shooting back. “Of course it was pistol versus rifle, our pistols versus the shooter’s rifle on the third-base line just outside the chain-link fence, and he was warning us to stay down.” He added: “But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those aren’t good odds.” By 7.09am, Alexandria police had received a call reporting shots fired at the park, according to the chief, Michael Brown. Three minutes later, they arrived at the scene. Hodgkinson – a home inspector who, it was soon revealed, had volunteered for Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign – was shot at 7.14am. His rampage had lasted roughly 10 minutes. Congressman Mike Conaway said: “The guy’s down to a handgun, he dropped his rifle, they shoot him, I go over there, they put him in handcuffs.” It was not clear how much time passed before Hodgkinson died. The cause was multiple gunshots to the torso, according to the coroner’s report. The coast finally clear, Brooks, Flake and others ran towards the wounded Scalise. Flake recalled: “I wanted to get to him but there were still shots going overhead from both sides. Finally, when the shooter was down, I just ran low out to Steve.” They put pressure on the hip wound to staunch the bleeding while Brad Wenstrup, a congressman from Ohio and a physician, checked for any other wounds. After medical personnel arrived, Flake said, he retrieved Scalise’s mobile phone. “I got his phone and called his wife, just to make sure she didn’t hear the news before. So, fortunately, she hadn’t, and I was able to tell her that he looked to be stable and we were with him.” A helicopter landed in the field and took five people to local hospitals with gunshot wounds: Scalise, who remains in critical condition, lobbyist Matt Mika, congressional aide Zachary Barth, a Capitol police officer and the gunman. Brooks said: “At that time, the police were causing all of us to gather outside the first base line and the chain-link fence and cordoning off the area to help ensure if there was a second shooter we would be better protected.” The typically tranquil neighbourhood was stunned. Bullets had lodged in or gone through windows of the nearby YMCA. Alex Heimberg, 19, who had arrived at 6am for a morning workout, had been in the basement during the gunfire. “We didn’t really know what to think of it,” he said. “It could be weights dropping from upstairs. It’s just something we’ve never experienced but we were given context when a man came down and said there was an active shooter and we said, ‘Oh crap, we need to get somewhere safe.’” One patron reacted casually, wrapping himself in a towel and using a sauna, Heimberg recalled. The YMCA was on lockdown for about three hours. It soon emerged that the shooter Hodgkinson was a leftwing activist with a record of domestic violence. He had signed an online petition calling for Donald Trump to be impeached and wrote on Facebook: “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” Hodgkinson’s Facebook page – later removed by the social network – also featured pictures of Senator Bernie Sanders, who said he had been informed that Hodgkinson had apparently volunteered for his presidential campaign last year. “I am sickened by this despicable act,” a shaken Sanders said on the Senate floor. “Let me be as clear as I can be: violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.” The drama in Alexandria all but cancelled the day’s business at the White House and Capitol Hill. At 11.36am, Donald Trump, sombre on his 71st birthday, announced: “The assailant has now died from his injuries.” In a partisan and rancorous political climate, Trump also made a measured appeal for unity. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” he said. And for a day, at least, the mood in Washington seemed to have changed. At 4pm, the managers of the Republican and Democratic congressional baseball teams appeared together at a joint press conference and vowed that the game at Nationals Park on Thursday would go on. Barton said: “It will be ‘play ball’ tomorrow night at 7.05.” Mike Doyle, the manager of the Democratic team, added: “We’re not going to let incidents like this change our way of life or daily routines.” The congressmen also had another message. They believed the attack was a consequence of the increasingly toxic political climate between politicians, the press and the public. “Members are not looked at as people any more,” Barton said, reflecting on the change since he was first elected in 1985. “People think they can come to our town hall meetings and say just the most obnoxious things and we’ll not feel anything personally.” As a first step, Doyle said the Democrats invited Republicans to the Democratic Club for dinner. Barton ribbed him that he would order the most expensive steak on the menu. Doyle shot back: “We’re Democrats. We don’t have steaks. That’s your club.”",2017-06-15 00:31:35,How a Republican baseball practice in Virginia became 'a killing field',,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Scarborough posted several tweets of his own, condemning Gingrich for his blatant suggestion that Mueller was in some way involved in a shadowy conspiracy against President Trump. Newt Gingrich took to Twitter early Thursday, and his words were straight to the point. He wrote: ""Mueller is now clearly the tip of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and crippling the Trump presidency.""Muelleris now clearly the ti[p of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and crippling the Trump presidency.— Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) June 15, 2017Gingrich, in his reference to the ""deep state,"" suggests that there is an orchestrated conspiracy against the president from within the established government, whereby career government employees hostile to the administration are actively involved in ridding Washington of President Trump. It is a conspiracy theory that has been making the rounds in Washington and in the media for the last few months. Moreover, Gingrich puts Mueller at the forefront of it. Muelleris now clearly the ti[p of the deep state spear aimed at destroying or at a minimum undermining and crippling the Trump presidency. Mueller, a former director of the FBI, was appointed to his current position to provide an independent investigation into the allegations of Russian interference (and, tangentially, any involvement that the Trump presidential campaign may have had) in the 2016 presidential election. Gingrich prefaced the Mueller accusation with a post that labeled Mueller as ""the anti-Trump special counsel."" Joe Scarborough accused Newt Gingrich of spreading conspiracy theories and ""sliming"" the good name of special counsel and former director of the FBI Robert Mueller. [Image by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP Images] Joe Scarborough, upon seeing Newt Gingrich's Twitter posts, took the time to address Gingrich's attempt to spread the ""deep state"" conspiracy theory, calling such rhetoric ""reckless."" He posted: ""It is hard to overstate how reckless the fanning of this anti-government conspiracy is the day after a mass shooting aimed at congressmen.It is hard to overstate how reckless the fanning of this anti-government conspiracy is the day after a mass shooting aimed at congressmen. https://t.co/zOkf4Pi91z— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) June 15, 2017The shooting of which Scarborough wrote occurred in Alexandria, Virginia, Wednesday at a Republicans' baseball practice for an annual charity event. According to CNN, at least six people were shot, including Rep. Steve Scalise (R - La.), the third-ranking member of House Republican leadership and majority whip, and were hospitalized after the incident. Federal law enforcement officials identified the alleged shooter as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, who was killed following a shootout with authorities. It is hard to overstate how reckless the fanning of this anti-government conspiracy is the day after a mass shooting aimed at congressmen. https://t.co/zOkf4Pi91z Scarborough did not stop with just the accusation that Gingrich was spreading a conspiracy theory. He repeated the accusation, then implied that Gingrich's words were meant to bolster the chances of his wife, Callista Gingrich, receiving congressional approval as ambassador to the Holy See (Vatican City). Scarborough wrote, ""This is grotesque and fans the flames of rage among the unbalanced.

Gingrich posted on May 17, ""Robert Mueller is a superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down"".

Although it is not yet clear why Newt Gingrich should alter his opinion of the special counsel so quickly, it is known that the Washington Post reported, just prior to Gingrich's tweets, that Robert Mueller was investigating President Trump and the possibility of obstruction of justice charges being filed against him in regard to the president's alleged interference in the Russian tampering investigation.

415,http://www.gq.com/story/the-resistance-will-be-merchandised,"By Kyle Chayka Photography by Ben Sklar RESISTANCE, PREJUDICE, STAND FOR YOURSELF. Under the Trump presidency, you might expect to see such empowered liberal vocabulary on a protest sign or following a hashtag, but one place you don’t is in the middle of the Port Authority subway station’s mildewed underground mall, where tourists buy NYC kitsch and desperate husbands pick up dusty bouquets on their commute home. In the glass storefront of the boutique R.A.G. New York, a dose of The Resistance can be found splashed across a bright red sweatshirt, jet-black fishtail hoodie, and shiny white bomber jacket. In 2017, politics has spread even here, and the message is on sale for just $16.99. The budget resistance-wear is from a New Jersey brand named Krome, and the line is called Anarchy. It’s a curious label for clothing that takes a seemingly progressive stance in its sloganeering, combining gaudy Banksy-lite graffiti and RESISTOR armbands into woke outerwear. Like a good protest sign, the Krome clothing is both radical and cheap—a combination that’s paying off. “Our brick-and-mortars sold them very well,” says Lisa Alves, who, alongside her husband, runs R.A.G.’s two stores underneath 41st and 42nd Streets, as well as its bustling website. According to the clothing’s creator, the seemingly anti-Trump invective is more of a marketing gimmick. “A lot of kids are upset with the system, the way the system is working,” says Max Bhavnani, the 42-year-old founder of Mischief International, Krome’s parent company. “We’re not saying that the system is right or wrong. We are just trying to be fashion, not trying to be political. Once you get political in your designs, then you have a 50-50 clientele. That’s not good. It’s always good to be neutral.” It’s a Trump-era echo of Michael Jordan’s alleged “Even Republicans buy sneakers” excuse for keeping partisanship out of retail. Liberal politics is only the latest trend that the Queens-born Bhavnani has capitalized on. He worked in the fast-fashion industry for eighteen years before striking out on his own in 2012 by launching Mischief International. (The name was inspired by his father, who founded a business called Mischief Sportswear before passing away when Bhavnani was 18.) Krome might be Mischief’s flagship brand, but as with the Anarchy line, its business is in discount imitation. Krome knocks off sneaker culture, working the wavy ankle shape of the original Nike Yeezys into a hood on a sweatshirt, or putting the mesh texture from Adidas NMD runners onto a T-shirt. The designs are manufactured in Shanghai, and the products go on sale in more than 600 stores, as well as on websites like DrJays.com, according to Bhavnani. In 2015, he hired a 35-year-old Korean designer and Parsons graduate named Chris Hwang to give Krome a new look. Bhavnani says he was struck by the social and political tumult going on at the time: The Baltimore riots following the murder of Freddie Gray, protests after the mass shooting at a church in South Carolina, and the terrorist attacks in Paris. “All this inspiration came with all the hatred and racism against African-Americans,” Bhavnani says. “That’s what Anarchy came from, just being against the system.” Hwang was brought in on the gambit to make fast-fashion wokeness. The word “RESISTANCE” was meant to “represent the spirit of the time,” Hwang says. “The government was very unstable and there were a lot of demonstrations in the U.S., so I wanted to express the situation through the collection.” Hwang left it at that, declining to explain his personal perspective further. Attempting to profit from politics while posing as apolitical has been a popular strategy of late. Versace prominently featured words like “UNIFIED” and “LOYALTY” in a February runway show while failing to clarify what the brand actually meant by them. Designer Demna Gvasalia hijacked Bernie Sanders’ logo for his Fall-Winter 2017 show. Pepsi’s Kendall Jenner ad might have marked the peak of woke-washing, but then Heineken surfed that backlash with its own milquetoast come-together commercial. Even the satirical Dog Rates Twitter account has taken to selling shirts that say “h*ck the system,” except the ""e"" is a paw print. Buy one for every dog-loving anarchist in your life. All of these insta-products made to go viral are hard to take, even if some are created with donation programs and sincere politics in mind. But Bhavnani’s appropriation of protest iconography, despite a commercial interest in remaining neutral, seems to take activism-jacking to another level. It takes guts to maintain a “gotta hear both sides” stance when your company is screen-printing shirts with images of SWAT teams clearly inspired by the riots in Baltimore. Krome reduces ideological conflict to Internet-meme status, then sells it at half off. In a subway basement. The artistry of the ripoff is almost admirable in its shameless erasure of any identifiable source. Krome also released a sweater emblazoned with the phrase “FCK the system,” featuring a two-inch drop shoulder that “almost feels like a shawl,” Bhavnani says. It was copied from a progressive Japanese label. Pressed further, the founder admits he found it on Instagram and doesn’t remember the exact source. “We also made a T-shirt that said ‘Peace’ with Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Gandhi in a frame,” Bhavnani says. “But we never dropped it.” It wasn’t that the imagery was excessive or under copyright; they just had too many designs and saved it for a future season. That unthinking pileup of famous faces with their collective politics boiled down to one word underlines the absurdity of Bhavnani’s enterprise. Krome’s Anarchy line is as empty as a prop can of Pepsi, at least to its producers. Through this kind of lazy appropriation, Krome—and every other company that sees ideology as merch—cheapens the protest language for everyone who actually believes in the cause. It’s a parasitical relationship: The brands degrade the space they inhabit. When the trend passes, they’ll find some other message to hijack, but the real problems their customers face will remain.

416,https://newsone.com/3719011/steve-scalise-shot-by-james-t-hodgkinson/,"Posted June 14, 2017 In what is being called a “deliberate attack,” a White male gunman was arrested, but later died Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, after shooting Republican House Rep. Steve Scalise, a congressional staffer and member of the congressional police force in a wild gun battle, according to CNN. Scalise, 51, the No. 3 House Republican leader who was elected in 2008 to the House of Representatives, was in stable condition and undergoing surgery at a nearby hospital. The injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, notes The Associated Press. The condition of the others who were shot was unknown. The suspected gunman, James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, died after initially surviving the shooting, Donald Trump said in a news conference carried by CNN. The cable news network reports that investigators have uncovered anti-Trump rhetoric on Hodgkinson’s social media accounts. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, took to the Senate floor to condemn the shooting and announce that the suspect was an apparent volunteer for his presidential campaign. The gunman reportedly approached Republican lawmakers before practice to ask their political party affiliations, the report says. The shooting, which sent shock waves around the nation, occurred about 7 a.m. at a popular park and baseball complex, where lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice for a charity game. The members were in batting practice when shots rang out, prompting everyone to duck and run for cover. “I was on deck about to hit batting practice on the third base side of home plate, and I hear a loud ‘bam,'” Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, of Charleston, South Carolina, who was at the game, told CNN. “I look around, and behind third base and the third base dugout, I see a rifle. And I see a little bit of a body. I hear another ‘bam’ and I realize, there’s an active shooter.” Before the shooting witnesses tell CNN they saw an older White man carrying a burlap sack and walking lethargically from a van, which was parked near the park. Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at the practice, also noted that the gunman was equipped with a lot of ammunition. Before holding his mid-morning news conference, Trump released a statement, saying, he was “deeply saddened by this tragedy” and was monitoring developments. While a motive has not been released, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have blamed the shooting on the negative political rhetoric. One lawmaker lamented about the nation’s unchecked mental health crisis, but so far no one has mentioned so-called thugs with guns (oh, the shooter doesn’t fit the stereotype), or lax gun control laws. What are your thoughts?

In the wake of the mass shooting in suburban Virginia last week that left House majority whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and three others wounded, conservatives have been furiously waving the bloody shirt. With left-wing hate filling half the screen, Sean Hannity blamed Democrats, saying they “dehumanize Republicans and paint them as monsters.” Tucker Carlson claimed that “some on the hard left” support political violence because it “could lead to the dissolution of a country they despise.” Others have blamed seemingly anything even vaguely identified with liberalism for inciting the violence—from Madonna to MSNBC to Shakespeare in the Park.				




This is all a truly remarkable example of projection. In the wake of the shooting, Erick Erickson wrote a piece titled, “The Violence is Only Getting Started,” as if three innocent people hadn’t been brutally murdered by white supremacists in two separate incidents in just the past month.
In the real world, since the end of the Vietnam era, the overwhelming majority of serious political violence—not counting vandalism or punches thrown at protests, but violence with lethal intent—has come from the fringes of the right. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project says that “if you go back to the 1960s, you see all kinds of left-wing terrorism, but since then it’s been exceedingly rare.” She notes that eco- and animal-rights extremists caused extensive property damage in the 1990s, but didn’t target people.
Meanwhile, says Beirich, “right-wing domestic terrorism has been common throughout that period, going back to groups like to The Order, which assassinated [liberal talk-radio host] Alan Berg [in 1984] right through to today.” Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told NPR that “when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders.” The actual share is higher still, as violence committed by ultraconservative Islamic supremacists isn’t included in tallies of “right-wing extremism.”
A 2015 survey of law-enforcement agencies conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that the police rate antigovernment extremists as a greater threat than reactionary Islamists. The authors wrote that “right-wing violence appears consistently greater than violence by Muslim extremists in the United States since 9/11, according to multiple definitions in multiple datasets.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, “Sovereign Citizens”—fringe antigovernmentalists—launched 24 violent attacks from 2010 through 2014, mostly against law enforcement personnel. When Robert Dear shot and killed three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, it became the latest in a series of bloody attacks on abortion providers dating back to Roe v. Wade in 1973. In the 30 years that followed that landmark decision, providers and clinics were targeted in more than 300 acts of violence, including arson, bombings, and assassinations, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.
But while the extreme right has held a near-monopoly on political violence since the 1980s, conservatives and Republicans are no more likely to say that using force to achieve one’s political goals is justified than are liberals and Democrats. That’s the conclusion of a study conducted by Nathan Kalmoe, a professor of political communication at the University of Louisiana. In 2010, he asked respondents whether they agreed that various violent tactics were acceptable. Kalmoe found that less than 3 percent of the population strongly agreed that “sometimes the only way to stop bad government is with physical force,” or that “some of the problems citizens have with government could be fixed with a few well-aimed bullets.” He says that while “there were tiny [partisan] variations on these specific items,” they weren’t “statistically significant on average.”
Ideology alone isn’t a significant risk factor for violence. “There’s a much stronger factor of individual personality traits that predispose people to be more aggressive in their everyday lives,” Kalmoe says, “and we see that playing out with people who engage in political violence.” Mass shooters are often found to have had histories of domestic violence, and that was true for James Hodgkinson, the shooter who attacked the congressional baseball practice in Virginia.

Call it the Minutemen theory of gun rights. While the Second Amendment was framed to protect government-organized militias at a time when we had a very small standing army, the right has promoted the idea that it’s “America’s first freedom,” integral to defending our other rights, since the 1960s.
It’s become ubiquitous, from the militia movement that arose in the 1980s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, to the armed standoffs at the Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife refuge. It animated Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, as well as the 2013 Los Angeles airport shooting spree, a 2014 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left two cops and one civilian dead and a number of less dramatic acts of violence.
The belief that democratic government rests on the Second Amendment has become widespread among Americans; one poll found that about two-thirds believe that “their constitutional right to own a gun was intended to ensure their freedom.” But Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of several books on the politics of guns, says that’s a modern idea. While “there’s a long tradition of some in America feeling deeply mistrustful of our government—and there have been incidents throughout our history where people took up arms against the government—the more specific idea that there’s a right to rebel, or that somehow you can keep the government under control by taking up weapons, found its first serious expression in a law review article published in 1960. And the idea really took hold among a subset of Americans and a subset of gun owners, who argue to this day that this was part of the purpose of the Second Amendment. They talk about the Minutemen and the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence. The idea really took hold in the 1970s and 1980s when the NRA itself began to use this same kind of rhetoric.”
It’s also infused right-wing politics beyond the gun lobby. Watering the “tree of liberty” with the “blood of patriots and tyrants” is a common theme in Tea Party circles, where the Gadsden flag—don’t tread on me!—and loose talk of revolution blend seamlessly with mainstream anti-tax ideology and disdain for liberals. While a handful of Democrats competing in red states have run ads featuring them firing weapons, it’s become almost universal in Republican campaigns, where it not only marks a candidate’s opposition to gun-safety legislation but also signals that he or she is ready to wage war against the Washington establishment.
War as a metaphor for politics isn’t limited to the right, but it has become a constant in conservative discourse. “The first shots of the second American civil war have already been fired,” said Alex Jones earlier this month. “We are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,” according to Newt Gingrich. Pat Buchanan offered that we’re “approaching something of a civil war,” and said that it’s time for Trump to “burn down the Bastille.” “You ain’t got any idea of the war that’s raging outside the four walls of the church,” religious-right activist Dave Daubenmire told a crowd of antigay protesters last weekend. “Don’t you understand what’s going on? Don’t you know it’s a war? Don’t you know they want your children? Don’t you understand that those same people singing ‘Jesus loves you this I know’ want to kill us?” Then there’s the quasi-apocalyptic prepper mentality, which holds that we’re on the brink of social collapse so you’d better buy gold and stock up on ammo for when the shit inevitably hits the fan.
Nathan Kalmoe says that there’s “an important distinction to make between people who have more conventional views, versus people who have much more extreme views.” He thinks that, whether on the left or the right, those who are at least somewhat close to the mainstream “probably have a greater commitment to nonviolent approaches to politics and are socialized into nonviolent norms of how participation is supposed to work.” But on the right those lines have become blurred in recent years—Glenn Beck’s goldbuggery, the ravings of the “alt-right” and the Minutemen theory of gun rights have all become features of the larger conservative landscape, even if they’re not quite mainstream.

Kalmoe says that rhetoric alone “isn’t the main cause of political violence, but violent language and vilifying opponents can nudge people in ways that make them think and act more aggressively in politics.” He conducted an experiment that first measured subjects’ aggressive personality traits. Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”
Liberals believe that mature institutions and the separation of powers are what keep tyranny at bay, not an AR-15. If James Hodgkinson looked around himself and saw a president who acts as if he’s above the law and a Congress that’s working in the dark to strip away health insurance from millions of people to finance tax cuts for the wealthy but is unwilling to perform its oversight duties, and decided that he would stand up to tyranny with an assault rifle, he would have taken a theme that’s exceedingly common on the right to its bloody logical conclusion. This is all a truly remarkable example of projection. In the wake of the shooting, Erick Erickson wrote a piece titled, “The Violence is Only Getting Started,” as if three innocent people hadn’t been brutally murdered by white supremacists in two separate incidents in just the past month.
In the real world, since the end of the Vietnam era, the overwhelming majority of serious political violence—not counting vandalism or punches thrown at protests, but violence with lethal intent—has come from the fringes of the right. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project says that “if you go back to the 1960s, you see all kinds of left-wing terrorism, but since then it’s been exceedingly rare.” She notes that eco- and animal-rights extremists caused extensive property damage in the 1990s, but didn’t target people.
Meanwhile, says Beirich, “right-wing domestic terrorism has been common throughout that period, going back to groups like to The Order, which assassinated [liberal talk-radio host] Alan Berg [in 1984] right through to today.” Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told NPR that “when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders.” The actual share is higher still, as violence committed by ultraconservative Islamic supremacists isn’t included in tallies of “right-wing extremism.”
A 2015 survey of law-enforcement agencies conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that the police rate antigovernment extremists as a greater threat than reactionary Islamists. The authors wrote that “right-wing violence appears consistently greater than violence by Muslim extremists in the United States since 9/11, according to multiple definitions in multiple datasets.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, “Sovereign Citizens”—fringe antigovernmentalists—launched 24 violent attacks from 2010 through 2014, mostly against law enforcement personnel. When Robert Dear shot and killed three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, it became the latest in a series of bloody attacks on abortion providers dating back to Roe v. Wade in 1973. In the 30 years that followed that landmark decision, providers and clinics were targeted in more than 300 acts of violence, including arson, bombings, and assassinations, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.
But while the extreme right has held a near-monopoly on political violence since the 1980s, conservatives and Republicans are no more likely to say that using force to achieve one’s political goals is justified than are liberals and Democrats. That’s the conclusion of a study conducted by Nathan Kalmoe, a professor of political communication at the University of Louisiana. In 2010, he asked respondents whether they agreed that various violent tactics were acceptable. Kalmoe found that less than 3 percent of the population strongly agreed that “sometimes the only way to stop bad government is with physical force,” or that “some of the problems citizens have with government could be fixed with a few well-aimed bullets.” He says that while “there were tiny [partisan] variations on these specific items,” they weren’t “statistically significant on average.”
Ideology alone isn’t a significant risk factor for violence. “There’s a much stronger factor of individual personality traits that predispose people to be more aggressive in their everyday lives,” Kalmoe says, “and we see that playing out with people who engage in political violence.” Mass shooters are often found to have had histories of domestic violence, and that was true for James Hodgkinson, the shooter who attacked the congressional baseball practice in Virginia. Kalmoe says, “we often see that violent individuals have a history of violence in their personal lives. People who are abusive, or who have run afoul of the law in other ways, are more likely to endorse violence.”
Political animosity is similarly bipartisan. According to Pew, roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats—around half—say they feel anger and fear toward the opposing party.

A 2015 survey of law-enforcement agencies conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum and the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security found that the police rate antigovernment extremists as a greater threat than reactionary Islamists. The authors wrote that “right-wing violence appears consistently greater than violence by Muslim extremists in the United States since 9/11, according to multiple definitions in multiple datasets.” According to the Department of Homeland Security, “Sovereign Citizens”—fringe antigovernmentalists—launched 24 violent attacks from 2010 through 2014, mostly against law enforcement personnel. When Robert Dear shot and killed three people at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic in 2015, it became the latest in a series of bloody attacks on abortion providers dating back to Roe v. Wade in 1973. In the 30 years that followed that landmark decision, providers and clinics were targeted in more than 300 acts of violence, including arson, bombings, and assassinations, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.
But while the extreme right has held a near-monopoly on political violence since the 1980s, conservatives and Republicans are no more likely to say that using force to achieve one’s political goals is justified than are liberals and Democrats. That’s the conclusion of a study conducted by Nathan Kalmoe, a professor of political communication at the University of Louisiana. In 2010, he asked respondents whether they agreed that various violent tactics were acceptable. Kalmoe found that less than 3 percent of the population strongly agreed that “sometimes the only way to stop bad government is with physical force,” or that “some of the problems citizens have with government could be fixed with a few well-aimed bullets.” He says that while “there were tiny [partisan] variations on these specific items,” they weren’t “statistically significant on average.”
Ideology alone isn’t a significant risk factor for violence. “There’s a much stronger factor of individual personality traits that predispose people to be more aggressive in their everyday lives,” Kalmoe says, “and we see that playing out with people who engage in political violence.” Mass shooters are often found to have had histories of domestic violence, and that was true for James Hodgkinson, the shooter who attacked the congressional baseball practice in Virginia. Kalmoe says, “we often see that violent individuals have a history of violence in their personal lives. People who are abusive, or who have run afoul of the law in other ways, are more likely to endorse violence.”
Political animosity is similarly bipartisan. According to Pew, roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats—around half—say they feel anger and fear toward the opposing party.
Which raises an important question: If red and blue America fear and loathe one another equally, and a similar number believe that political violence is acceptable, then why is there so much more of it on the fringes of the right?
Part of the answer lies in a clear difference between right and left: For the past 40 years, Republicans, parroting the gun-rights movement, have actively promoted the idea that firearms are a vital bulwark against government tyranny.

Call it the Minutemen theory of gun rights. While the Second Amendment was framed to protect government-organized militias at a time when we had a very small standing army, the right has promoted the idea that it’s “America’s first freedom,” integral to defending our other rights, since the 1960s.
It’s become ubiquitous, from the militia movement that arose in the 1980s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, to the armed standoffs at the Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife refuge. It animated Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, as well as the 2013 Los Angeles airport shooting spree, a 2014 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left two cops and one civilian dead and a number of less dramatic acts of violence.
The belief that democratic government rests on the Second Amendment has become widespread among Americans; one poll found that about two-thirds believe that “their constitutional right to own a gun was intended to ensure their freedom.” But Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of several books on the politics of guns, says that’s a modern idea. While “there’s a long tradition of some in America feeling deeply mistrustful of our government—and there have been incidents throughout our history where people took up arms against the government—the more specific idea that there’s a right to rebel, or that somehow you can keep the government under control by taking up weapons, found its first serious expression in a law review article published in 1960. And the idea really took hold among a subset of Americans and a subset of gun owners, who argue to this day that this was part of the purpose of the Second Amendment. They talk about the Minutemen and the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence. The idea really took hold in the 1970s and 1980s when the NRA itself began to use this same kind of rhetoric.”
It’s also infused right-wing politics beyond the gun lobby. Watering the “tree of liberty” with the “blood of patriots and tyrants” is a common theme in Tea Party circles, where the Gadsden flag—don’t tread on me!—and loose talk of revolution blend seamlessly with mainstream anti-tax ideology and disdain for liberals. While a handful of Democrats competing in red states have run ads featuring them firing weapons, it’s become almost universal in Republican campaigns, where it not only marks a candidate’s opposition to gun-safety legislation but also signals that he or she is ready to wage war against the Washington establishment.
War as a metaphor for politics isn’t limited to the right, but it has become a constant in conservative discourse. “The first shots of the second American civil war have already been fired,” said Alex Jones earlier this month. “We are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,” according to Newt Gingrich. Pat Buchanan offered that we’re “approaching something of a civil war,” and said that it’s time for Trump to “burn down the Bastille.” “You ain’t got any idea of the war that’s raging outside the four walls of the church,” religious-right activist Dave Daubenmire told a crowd of antigay protesters last weekend. “Don’t you understand what’s going on? Don’t you know it’s a war? Don’t you know they want your children? Don’t you understand that those same people singing ‘Jesus loves you this I know’ want to kill us?” Then there’s the quasi-apocalyptic prepper mentality, which holds that we’re on the brink of social collapse so you’d better buy gold and stock up on ammo for when the shit inevitably hits the fan.
Nathan Kalmoe says that there’s “an important distinction to make between people who have more conventional views, versus people who have much more extreme views.” He thinks that, whether on the left or the right, those who are at least somewhat close to the mainstream “probably have a greater commitment to nonviolent approaches to politics and are socialized into nonviolent norms of how participation is supposed to work.” But on the right those lines have become blurred in recent years—Glenn Beck’s goldbuggery, the ravings of the “alt-right” and the Minutemen theory of gun rights have all become features of the larger conservative landscape, even if they’re not quite mainstream.

Kalmoe says that rhetoric alone “isn’t the main cause of political violence, but violent language and vilifying opponents can nudge people in ways that make them think and act more aggressively in politics.” He conducted an experiment that first measured subjects’ aggressive personality traits. Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”

If James Hodgkinson looked around himself and saw a president who acts as if he’s above the law and a Congress that’s working in the dark to strip away health insurance from millions of people to finance tax cuts for the wealthy but is unwilling to perform its oversight duties, and decided that he would stand up to tyranny with an assault rifle, he would have taken a theme that’s exceedingly common on the right to its bloody logical conclusion. Part of the answer lies in a clear difference between right and left: For the past 40 years, Republicans, parroting the gun-rights movement, have actively promoted the idea that firearms are a vital bulwark against government tyranny.

.@Judgenap: Why do we have a Second Amendment? It’s not to shoot deer. It’s to shoot at the government when it becomes tyrannical!
—Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 23, 2016

Call it the Minutemen theory of gun rights. While the Second Amendment was framed to protect government-organized militias at a time when we had a very small standing army, the right has promoted the idea that it’s “America’s first freedom,” integral to defending our other rights, since the 1960s.
It’s become ubiquitous, from the militia movement that arose in the 1980s and has seen a resurgence in recent years, to the armed standoffs at the Bundy Ranch and the Malheur National Wildlife refuge. It animated Timothy McVeigh to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, as well as the 2013 Los Angeles airport shooting spree, a 2014 mass shooting in Las Vegas that left two cops and one civilian dead and a number of less dramatic acts of violence.
The belief that democratic government rests on the Second Amendment has become widespread among Americans; one poll found that about two-thirds believe that “their constitutional right to own a gun was intended to ensure their freedom.” But Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at SUNY Cortland and the author of several books on the politics of guns, says that’s a modern idea. While “there’s a long tradition of some in America feeling deeply mistrustful of our government—and there have been incidents throughout our history where people took up arms against the government—the more specific idea that there’s a right to rebel, or that somehow you can keep the government under control by taking up weapons, found its first serious expression in a law review article published in 1960. And the idea really took hold among a subset of Americans and a subset of gun owners, who argue to this day that this was part of the purpose of the Second Amendment. They talk about the Minutemen and the Revolutionary War and the Declaration of Independence. The idea really took hold in the 1970s and 1980s when the NRA itself began to use this same kind of rhetoric.”
It’s also infused right-wing politics beyond the gun lobby. Watering the “tree of liberty” with the “blood of patriots and tyrants” is a common theme in Tea Party circles, where the Gadsden flag—don’t tread on me!—and loose talk of revolution blend seamlessly with mainstream anti-tax ideology and disdain for liberals. While a handful of Democrats competing in red states have run ads featuring them firing weapons, it’s become almost universal in Republican campaigns, where it not only marks a candidate’s opposition to gun-safety legislation but also signals that he or she is ready to wage war against the Washington establishment.
War as a metaphor for politics isn’t limited to the right, but it has become a constant in conservative discourse. “The first shots of the second American civil war have already been fired,” said Alex Jones earlier this month. “We are in a clear-cut cultural civil war,” according to Newt Gingrich. Pat Buchanan offered that we’re “approaching something of a civil war,” and said that it’s time for Trump to “burn down the Bastille.” “You ain’t got any idea of the war that’s raging outside the four walls of the church,” religious-right activist Dave Daubenmire told a crowd of antigay protesters last weekend. “Don’t you understand what’s going on? Don’t you know it’s a war? Don’t you know they want your children? Don’t you understand that those same people singing ‘Jesus loves you this I know’ want to kill us?” Then there’s the quasi-apocalyptic prepper mentality, which holds that we’re on the brink of social collapse so you’d better buy gold and stock up on ammo for when the shit inevitably hits the fan.
Nathan Kalmoe says that there’s “an important distinction to make between people who have more conventional views, versus people who have much more extreme views.” He thinks that, whether on the left or the right, those who are at least somewhat close to the mainstream “probably have a greater commitment to nonviolent approaches to politics and are socialized into nonviolent norms of how participation is supposed to work.” But on the right those lines have become blurred in recent years—Glenn Beck’s goldbuggery, the ravings of the “alt-right” and the Minutemen theory of gun rights have all become features of the larger conservative landscape, even if they’re not quite mainstream.

Kalmoe says that rhetoric alone “isn’t the main cause of political violence, but violent language and vilifying opponents can nudge people in ways that make them think and act more aggressively in politics.” He conducted an experiment that first measured subjects’ aggressive personality traits. Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”

If James Hodgkinson looked around himself and saw a president who acts as if he’s above the law and a Congress that’s working in the dark to strip away health insurance from millions of people to finance tax cuts for the wealthy but is unwilling to perform its oversight duties, and decided that he would stand up to tyranny with an assault rifle, he would have taken a theme that’s exceedingly common on the right to its bloody logical conclusion.

Then he exposed them to two imaginary political ads, one that employed mildly violent political rhetoric and one that used neutral language, and he found that those subjects who had already displayed a penchant for aggressive behavior were far more likely to support political violence after being exposed to the violent rhetoric. So it’s not that violent rhetoric causes real-world violence so much as it can “make people who behave aggressively in real-life more likely to endorse violence against political leaders.”

""I'm sorry that he did this, but there's nothing I can do about it,"" she said, according to interviews posted on St. Louis television stations' websites. Suzanne Hodgkinson said she thought her husband had traveled to Washington to focus on tax issues but had not known much of what he was doing. She works for a tax firm, she said, and was busy in recent months. Facebook page of Virginia shooter's wife becomes heated public battleground The couple had been married for 30 years, she said, and he'd sold almost everything from his business before moving out to D.C. in March. She said she thought he was going to return to Illinois because he'd run out of money. Suzanne Hodgkinson asked reporters to leave the area, saying that she and her family had been through enough. Richard Wagner, chief deputy of the St. Clair County sheriff's office, said afterward that Hodgkinson was told about the shooting by a journalist and has been with the FBI since the shooting. ""She had no idea he would do this. She had no idea he felt as strong as he did,"" Wagner said. ""She's just devastated."" In Belleville, residents continued to grapple with the news that one of their own, a man many knew could be quick to anger, but who many said didn't show outward signs of violence, could have committed the mass shooting. Tom Reis has owned the popular T.R.'s Place about a mile from Hodgkinson's home since 1997. ""It makes you feel real bad that something like this is connected to here,"" Reis said. ""We had policemen and even the FBI in here asking questions, but we just don't know him."" A half-dozen patrons gathered at the tavern Thursday afternoon for the $1 taco special and to shoot pool said Hodgkinson didn't hang out there and wasn't known to them. ""What makes a guy do something like that? I think it's terrible,"" Reis said. ""It doesn't matter whether you're Republican, Democrat, black or white, Muslim or whatever. You just don't go out and shoot someone."" Jack McClenahan, a retired Belleville business owner, said he had several unpleasant run-ins with Hodgkinson over the years while Hodgkinson protested a favored Democratic political cause outside the local post office. ""He would get politically aggressive. I go down to the post office quite often, and he would be there collecting signatures on things he was for, and if you weren't of his opinion, he'd be very agitated,"" McClenahan said. ""It was super shocking for our town because you don't want bad press, and this is about as bad as press you can get,"" he said. cmgutowski@chicagotribune.com Twitter @ChristyGutowsk1 CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2017-06-15 19:34:19,Wife of Virginia shooter James Hodgkinson: 'I'm sorry that he did this',,104826,http://www.chicagotribune.com/hoy/

Presenting the award for Best New Musical while wearing a rainbow LGBTQ+ ribbon, Miranda said, “I’m so proud to be a part of the grand tradition of the American Broadway musical…. During difficult times, musicals provide entertainment and escape, but they’ve also given us hope.” Miranda was briefly interrupted by President Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), his wife Claire (Robin Wright), and chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), but eventually presented the award to Dear Evan Hansen. (See the full list of 2017 Tony winners here.) Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton share an important connection: Alex Lacamoire did the orchestrations for both shows (and won back-to-back Tonys for his work in 2016 and now, 2017), and both shows began their runs off-Broadway at the Public Theater. Last year’s Tony Awards took place just after the mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub, which led Miranda to read a moving sonnet he’d written as his acceptance speech.

Never forget.” tweeted Billy On the Street star Eichner, including an image that featured pictures of every victim who died. “A year later, and the loss and the shock still feels like just this morning,” wrote Hamilton creator (and Mary Poppins star) Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Thinking about you today Orlando. Always.” The shooting, which also left 53 people injured and is now considered the worst mass shooting in U.S. history, occurred last year on the same day as the Tony Awards. At the ceremony, Miranda read a powerful sonnet written in honor of the victims while accepting an award for best original score. “We chase the melodies that seem to find us until they’re finished songs and start to play,” Miranda said while accepting the award for Hamilton. “When senseless acts of tragedy remind us that nothing here is promised, not one day. This show is proof that history remembers/ We live through times when hate and fear seem stronger/ We rise and fall and light from dying embers remembrance that hope and love last forever.

The Carmichael Show is a critic-friendly family comedy that delves into topics such as gun control and sexual assault, and this episode focuses on the emotional fallout of a deadly mall shooting that Jerrod (Jerrod Carmichael) witnessed. “The family tries to get Jerrod to talk about his feelings about it,” Carmichael told EW last month. It did not depict the actual shooting. Carmichael expressed his dissatisfaction about NBC’s decision to yank the episode to Chelsea Handler on her Netflix talk show, saying, “A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that’s not the news, people will say, ‘Too soon.’ But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately, these things happen constantly and it’s a thing that breaks all of our hearts. … I understand a corporation making that decision, but really, to me, what it says is you don’t think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims. We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we could. To pull that is just criminal. It does a disservice to the viewer, it does a disservice to you, it does a disservice to all of us.” A few days later, he explained to IndieWire that he was appreciative of the dialogue that he had with NBC Entertainment chairmen Bob Greenblatt about the episode. “Ultimately, the network’s largest fears won out and they decided not to air it,” Carmichael said. “But it was a great moment for me and Bob Greenblatt talking about this. He was very thoughtful about it and he had a lot of real things to say, a lot of real concerns, and I think we handled it. It was a very great collaborative moment. It, unfortunately, did not produce the result that I think we wanted.” Viewers will finally get to see the results of Carmichael’s efforts Wednesday night at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.",2017-06-27 14:01:36,Carmichael Show mass shooting episode will now air June 28,,72605,http://www.ew.com
424,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/republican-baseball-shooting-virginia-what-happened,"In a rampage lasting 10 awful minutes, a gunman targeted Republican politicians as they held an early-morning practice in a picturesque park Last modified on Fri 14 Jul 2017 17.59 BST America has been made to endure this pain before, when a mass shooting has desecrated its most cherished spaces: a schoolroom in Newtown; a cinema in Aurora; a church in Charleston. This time, with the dawn, a baseball park in Virginia became, in the words of Senator Rand Paul, “a killing field”.  What politicians who trade their suits and ties for baseball uniforms lack in fitness, they make up for in earnest enthusiasm. Such is the dedication of Steve Scalise, the No 3 House Republican, and his colleagues that they regularly start practice at 6.15 or 6.30am at the Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, across the Potomac river from Washington DC. This allows them to beat the heat, which was heading towards 90F(32C) on Wednesday, and the clamour of Capitol Hill. Their surroundings are a serene, affluent area of detached redbrick houses with porches, clipped lawns and trees where trouble is hard to imagine. The baseball field is close to the park where local people walk their dogs, a children’s playground and a YMCA. It lies about halfway between Washington DC to the north and George Washington’s farm, Mount Vernon, to the south. There were 20 House members and two senators present, according to the congressman Joe Barton of Texas, the Republican team’s manager, grabbing the last chance to hit some balls before Thursday’s annual charity game against their Democratic rivals. Just after 7am, a man who would be identified later as James Hodgkinson, 66, from Belleville, Illinois, walked up to two congressmen, Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, as they were getting into their car to leave the field, the pair recalled. Duncan told reporters that the man had “asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or Republican team. I told him they were Republicans. He said, ‘OK, thanks,’ turned around.” Minutes later, as the dedicated amateurs were nearing the end of batting practice, there was a loud bang. They stopped and stared, puzzled. Rodney Davis of Illinois said later that he thought something heavy had dropped at a construction site. “He’s got a gun!” someone shouted. Another person yelled: “Hit the ground!” One of the most vivid accounts would come from Mo Brooks, an Alabama congressman. “I was on deck, about to hit batting practice on the third-base side of home plate, and I heard a loud ‘bam’, and I look around and behind third base and the third base dugout, which is cinderblock, I see a rifle,” he told CNN. “And I see a little bit of a body and I then hear another ‘blam’ and I realise that there’s an active shooter.” Hodgkinson, wearing jeans and blue shirt, was wielding a rifle from behind a chain-link fence near third base. By most estimates, he would fire at least 50 rounds, the bullets kicking up earth and gravel. There was pandemonium. Brutally exposed on the open field, people variously hit the deck, dived into a dugout for cover, raced into the dog park or jumped over a fence and ran for their lives. The team manager Joe Barton’s 10-year-old son Jack hid under an SUV. Mike Bishop of Michigan told the New York Times: “He was hunting us at that point. There was so much gunfire, you couldn’t get up and run. Pop, pop, pop, pop – it’s a sound I’ll never forget.” Hodgkinson kept firing as he moved from near the third-base dugout towards the backstop behind home plate. He never got on to the field because the chain-link fence around the park was locked. Barton said later: “Had he gotten in the fence, it would have been a bloodbath.” The Texas congressman Roger Williams, who coaches the Republican team, added: “We were sitting ducks. We had nothing to fight back with but bats, if it came to that.” The first victim was Scalise, 51, who had been fielding balls on second base. He was hit in the hip and collapsed to the ground, screaming. He managed to drag himself to the outfield grass, leaving a trail of blood, witnesses said later. Two Capitol Hill police officers, Crystal Griner and David Bailey, who were in Scalise’s security detail, immediately returned fire. Senator Jeff Flake yelled: “Are you friendly? Are you friendly?” One shouted back: “Yes!” One of the officers suffered a gunshot wound but kept firing. Both were widely praised for saving numerous lives. An Alexandria resident, Katie Fillus, told the Washington Post she saw a female officer pull out a gun and scream, “Drop your weapon!” but the gunman shot her. “She fell on the ground in front of us, and we were all just trying to lay as flat we could. And I belly-crawled, dragging through the mud. I got to the car and I ducked under the car and I laid as close as I could under the car to hide from the person. Then the police seemed to come.” Brooks, meanwhile, had thrown himself down at home plate, but decided to take a chance and run to the first base dugout, where about a dozen congressmen and aides were lying. Among them was congressional aide Zachary Barth, who had been struck in the leg and hobbled across the field. Brooks took off his belt and another congressman applied a tourniquet to try to slow the bleeding. “In the meantime,” Brooks told CNN, “I’m towards the right-field side of the dugout and there’s gunfire within about five, six, seven feet of my head, and I look up and there’s a guy with a gun blasting away. Fortunately, it was one of the good guys, one of our security detail, who was shooting back. “Of course it was pistol versus rifle, our pistols versus the shooter’s rifle on the third-base line just outside the chain-link fence, and he was warning us to stay down.” He added: “But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those aren’t good odds.” By 7.09am, Alexandria police had received a call reporting shots fired at the park, according to the chief, Michael Brown. Three minutes later, they arrived at the scene. Hodgkinson – a home inspector who, it was soon revealed, had volunteered for Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign – was shot at 7.14am. His rampage had lasted roughly 10 minutes. Congressman Mike Conaway said: “The guy’s down to a handgun, he dropped his rifle, they shoot him, I go over there, they put him in handcuffs.” It was not clear how much time passed before Hodgkinson died. The cause was multiple gunshots to the torso, according to the coroner’s report. The coast finally clear, Brooks, Flake and others ran towards the wounded Scalise. Flake recalled: “I wanted to get to him but there were still shots going overhead from both sides. Finally, when the shooter was down, I just ran low out to Steve.” They put pressure on the hip wound to staunch the bleeding while Brad Wenstrup, a congressman from Ohio and a physician, checked for any other wounds. After medical personnel arrived, Flake said, he retrieved Scalise’s mobile phone. “I got his phone and called his wife, just to make sure she didn’t hear the news before. So, fortunately, she hadn’t, and I was able to tell her that he looked to be stable and we were with him.” A helicopter landed in the field and took five people to local hospitals with gunshot wounds: Scalise, who remains in critical condition, lobbyist Matt Mika, congressional aide Zachary Barth, a Capitol police officer and the gunman. Brooks said: “At that time, the police were causing all of us to gather outside the first base line and the chain-link fence and cordoning off the area to help ensure if there was a second shooter we would be better protected.” The typically tranquil neighbourhood was stunned. Bullets had lodged in or gone through windows of the nearby YMCA. Alex Heimberg, 19, who had arrived at 6am for a morning workout, had been in the basement during the gunfire. “We didn’t really know what to think of it,” he said. “It could be weights dropping from upstairs. It’s just something we’ve never experienced but we were given context when a man came down and said there was an active shooter and we said, ‘Oh crap, we need to get somewhere safe.’” One patron reacted casually, wrapping himself in a towel and using a sauna, Heimberg recalled. The YMCA was on lockdown for about three hours. It soon emerged that the shooter Hodgkinson was a leftwing activist with a record of domestic violence. He had signed an online petition calling for Donald Trump to be impeached and wrote on Facebook: “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” Hodgkinson’s Facebook page – later removed by the social network – also featured pictures of Senator Bernie Sanders, who said he had been informed that Hodgkinson had apparently volunteered for his presidential campaign last year. “I am sickened by this despicable act,” a shaken Sanders said on the Senate floor. “Let me be as clear as I can be: violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.” The drama in Alexandria all but cancelled the day’s business at the White House and Capitol Hill. At 11.36am, Donald Trump, sombre on his 71st birthday, announced: “The assailant has now died from his injuries.” In a partisan and rancorous political climate, Trump also made a measured appeal for unity. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” he said. And for a day, at least, the mood in Washington seemed to have changed. At 4pm, the managers of the Republican and Democratic congressional baseball teams appeared together at a joint press conference and vowed that the game at Nationals Park on Thursday would go on. Barton said: “It will be ‘play ball’ tomorrow night at 7.05.” Mike Doyle, the manager of the Democratic team, added: “We’re not going to let incidents like this change our way of life or daily routines.” The congressmen also had another message. They believed the attack was a consequence of the increasingly toxic political climate between politicians, the press and the public. “Members are not looked at as people any more,” Barton said, reflecting on the change since he was first elected in 1985. “People think they can come to our town hall meetings and say just the most obnoxious things and we’ll not feel anything personally.” As a first step, Doyle said the Democrats invited Republicans to the Democratic Club for dinner. Barton ribbed him that he would order the most expensive steak on the menu. Doyle shot back: “We’re Democrats. We don’t have steaks. That’s your club.”",2017-06-14 20:31:35,How a Republican baseball practice in Virginia became 'a killing field',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

The centerpiece event, the Equality March in Washington, was endorsed by virtually every major national advocacy group working on behalf of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans.  Leaders of those groups have been embittered by several actions of Donald Trump’s administration – including the rollback of federal guidance advising school districts to let transgender students use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice. The activists also complain that Trump, although he campaigned as a potential ally of gays and lesbians, has stocked his administration with many foes of LGBT-rights advances, including vice-president Mike Pence, attorney general Jeff Sessions, and health and human services secretary Tom Price. Throngs of marchers, many thousands strong, paraded past the White House and toward the Capitol, trailing behind a giant rainbow flag near the head of the procession. “We’re here, we’re queer, get that Cheeto out of here,” was among the chants directed at Trump. For the LGBT community nationwide, it’s an emotional time. Monday is the anniversary of the mass shooting a year ago in Orlando, Florida, that killed 49 people – mostly Latinos – at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Among the marchers in Washington was Gil Mendez, a Puerto Rican native who traveled with his partner all the way from San Francisco to join the parade. He carried a sign that included the names of all the Pulse victims. “The attack on Pulse really struck me hard,” he said. “It made the connection between the physical violence of guns and the political attacks on our community.” Also marching, and singing freedom songs and patriotic songs along the way, were scores of members of gay choruses from various cities. “It’s an opportunity to tell everyone we’re still here, and we’re not going away at all,” said Gregory Elfers of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was with a contingent from the New York City Gay Men’s Chorus. “We have to be heard – we have to be sure we’re not trampled on,” said L Owen Taggart of Washington’s Gay Men’s Chorus. Roughly 100 marches and rallies were planned across the US, from Portland, Maine, and Boston to Anchorage, Alaska, and Honolulu. More than 100,000 people were expected to turn out in Los Angeles where the annual Pride Parade was renamed the ResistMarch. Activists in Casper, Wyoming, planned that city’s first-ever pride parade. Among the activist leaders on hand in Washington was Sarah Kate Ellis, president of Glaad, which monitors media coverage of the LGBT community. She noted that Trump, breaking from the practice of Barack Obama, has declined to issue a proclamation in honor of Pride Month, and that the Trump administration has deleted questions about sexual orientation from planned federal surveys. “If you look at their prioritization, we’re really low on it,” she said. “There absolutely is a resistance aspect to this march.”",2017-06-11 14:35:07,Anti-Trump sentiment permeates LGBT Pride marches across US,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

X OUR PICKS: By HILLEL ITALIE NEW YORK (AP) — Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones hemmed and hawed when pressed repeatedly by Megyn Kelly to admit he was wrong to call the massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, a hoax. Jones never gave a direct answer in a segment on NBC’s “Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.” Kelly has been criticized intensely for giving a platform to Jones, who has also called the Sept. 11 attacks an inside job and promoted the false story that a pizza place in Washington, D.C. was the site of a child sex ring. She has defended her decision by noting that his influence has grown with the rise of President Donald Trump, who has praised Jones and appeared on his radio program. “Here’s the thing, Alex Jones isn’t going away,” she said Sunday night. The “Infowars” host said at one point that he was playing “devil’s advocate” in denying the 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. But he added that he remained skeptical after he “watched the footage” of children leaving the building. “Some of it looks like it’s real but then what do you do when they’ve got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up. I’ve watched the footage,” he said. “That looks like a drill.” The segment with Jones combined Kelly’s interview with background on his history of false remarks, his relationship with Trump and comments from Newtown parent Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, was killed in the shooting. When Kelly asked him whether he had anything to say to Jones for Father’s Day, he responded, “I think he’s blessed to have his children to spend the day with, to speak to. I don’t have that.” Last week, Jones leaked an audio recording of what he said was a phone conversation with Kelly, heard promising she would not portray him as “some kind of boogeyman.” Shortly before Sunday’s night interview, Jones released a Father’s Day video in which he offered condolences to families who had lost children in the “horrible tragedy” of Newtown, but did not refer to his previous comments disputing the killings. “Parents should never have to bury their own children,” Jones said. Connecticut’s NBC affiliate said Friday it wouldn’t air the report. In an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, NBC Connecticut staff members were told station executives made the decision after listening to concerns from employees, Sandy Hook families and viewers and considering “the deep emotions from the wounds of that day that have yet to heal.” Lawyers who represent 12 people who lost loved ones at Sandy Hook urged NBC News officials not to air the interview. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack told the AP that the Jones story would be edited with its critics in mind. The interview also was seen as a test of the interviewing skills of Kelly, the former Fox News star whose questions two weeks ago for Vladimir Putin were widely panned for being too easy on the Russian leader. An unaired segment obtained by Huffington Post showed Kelly telling him that “virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia.” Kelly challenged Jones from the start, introducing him as a “radical conspiracy theorist” and promising to confront him on his “notorious lie” about Sandy Hook. The two frequently interrupted each other as Kelly kept asking if he would admit to his wrongdoing and a visibly tense Jones kept deflecting her questions, blaming the media for distorting his remarks or veering between acknowledging and disputing the tragedy. “I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil’s advocate,” he said. Answered Kelly: “Of course, there is no evidence on the other side.” Related Articles

After spending more than a decade at Fox, Kelly signed a multimillion dollar contract with NBC earlier this year. Her star power had grown after she challenged Trump during a 2015 Republican debate on his history of sexist remarks and the candidate responded with a series of angry tweets and other comments, sometimes crude and personal, and boycotted a later debate because she was one of the moderators. She then was a key figure in the downfall of former Fox News chief Roger Ailes, telling in-house investigators of inappropriate conduct by Ailes that supported Gretchen Carlson and other women who had made similar accusations. Kelly wrote of her battles with Trump and Ailes in her best-selling memoir from 2016, “Settle for More.” Kelly’s old employer needled her over the weekend, sending a tweet headlined “Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones: NBC News under fire for ‘botched’ rollout.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Citing President Trump’s appearance on Jones’ program, in which the then-candidate lauded Jones’ reputation as “amazing,” as well as speeches and tweets referring to Infowars’ reporting, Kelly’s interview largely focused on Jones’ dissemination of conspiracy theories. “When you say parents faked their children’s death, people get very angry,” Kelly said, in response to Jones’ refusal to disavow his belief that the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, was a government-orchestrated hoax. Kelly noted that Jones “never completely disavowed his previous statements” during the interview. “Listeners and other people are covering this,” Jones said. “I didn’t create that story.” Kelly, who is making her entrée into network prime-time after 13 years at Fox News, and Jones had both come under criticism after the interview was announced. Families of children killed at Sandy Hook begged NBC to cancel the interview. Kelly was defiant at the segment’s opening, saying “Alex Jones isn’t going away,” and that he has “the ear of our current president.” Watch the full interview here:",2017-06-19 11:19:20,Alex Jones In Megyn Kelly Interview: ‘I Know Trump Watches’,"politics and government,united states politics and government,television,terrorism,crime and criminals,radio",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

432,http://abcnews.go.com/US/guns-mass-shootings-obtained-legally-including-congressional-baseball/story?id=48055331,"A legally purchased gun was used in the congressional shooting. FBI: Gunman acted alone in shooting of congressman — -- The firearms used in last week's shooting at a Virginia park where Republican congressmen were practicing baseball were purchased legally by the alleged gunman, according to multiple law enforcement sources. That reportedly follows a pattern, as many of the guns used in recent mass shootings were also obtained lawfully. According to a database maintained by Mother Jones, there have been at least 90 mass shootings in the United States since 1982, and most of the shooters got their guns legally. The database focuses on what the publication calls ""indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker,"" and excludes shootings stemming from more conventional crimes such as armed robbery or gang violence. Of the 143 guns wielded by killers in mass shootings, more than three quarters were obtained legally, including dozens of assault weapons and semi-automatic handguns with high-capacity magazines, according to Mother Jones. In January of 2013, Mother Jones also began including shootings in which three or more people died, after a federal mandate for investigations of mass shootings lowered the victim baseline from four to three. Other databases differ in both their guidelines and tallies of mass shootings. Gun Violence Archive, which collects data from shooting incidents, defines a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people are wounded or killed, not including the perpetrator. By that definition, it tallies at least 160 mass shootings already in the first five and one half months of 2017. Here’s a timeline based on news reports of some public shootings over the past two years in which authorities confirmed the weapons were obtained legally: Vale said the suspected shooter, identified by authorities as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson, legally purchased the SKS rifle in March 2003 and the handgun in November 2016 through federal firearms licensees. Multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News he was able to purchase both weapons legally because he had no felony convictions, though he reportedly had several previous run-ins with the law. Hodgkinson, who also owned a shotgun, is believed to have obtained a permit in approximately the last two months to carry a concealed weapon, sources told ABC News. At a news conference Wednesday morning, Vale said Hodgkinson ""acted alone” and the FBI so far doesn’t believe there is any nexus to terrorism, though the motive remains unknown. Five people were injured in the shooting, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, whose condition was upgraded from ""serious"" to ""fair"" on Wednesday afternoon. Hodgkinson died from injuries sustained while exchanging gunfire with authorities at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park, which is about seven miles from the White House. Esteban Santiago, a 26-year-old Iraq War veteran, is accused of going on a murderous rampage at an airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that left five people dead and six others injured on Jan. 6. Santiago allegedly began his shooting spree in a baggage claim area with a gun that federal law enforcement officials told ABC News was checked legally in his luggage. The combat engineer had received a discharge for unsatisfactory performance at the rank of E3 – or Private First Class – on Aug. 16, 2016. Federal authorities told ABC News that Santiago had recently received mental health treatment after he showed up at the FBI’s office in Anchorage, Alaska, claiming that the government was forcing him to watch videos produced by the ISIS terror group. In that incident, Anchorage police found Santiago's gun in his vehicle, held it until he was released four days later and contacted him about picking up the weapon, which he did on Dec. 8, according to a Chicago Tribune interview with the Anchorage police chief. Omar Mateen, 29, allegedly killed 49 people and wounded 53 others at Pulse, a gay nightclub, in Orlando, Florida, in the early morning of June 12, 2016. After a shootout with police and taking clubgoers hostage, Mateen was shot and killed by authorities. Mateen purchased an AR-15-style rifle and a handgun from a federally licensed dealer near his home in Fort Pierce, Florida, on separate days about a week before the attack. He passed a full background check and had two security-officer licenses, one of which allowed him to be armed while on duty, according to Ed Henson, owner of the St. Lucie Shooting Center. Mateen was investigated by the FBI in 2013 and 2014, after his co-workers expressed concerns about statements he had made concerning possible ties to terrorist groups. Neither inquiry led to criminal charges. Jason Brian Dalton, a 45-year-old former Uber driver, was arrested after he allegedly opened fire in three locations in Kalamazoo, Michigan, killing six people and injuring two others on Feb. 20, 2016. Dalton faces trial on charges of murder, assault with intent to commit murder and using a firearm during the commission of a felony. Dalton allegedly used two legally purchased 9 mm semi-automatic handguns in the killing of two people at a Kia car dealership and four people outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Police say he bought the firearms at a local gun shop in 2015 and had no disqualifying criminal or mental health history. It's unclear how Dalton obtained 14 other guns that authorities said federal agents later seized while searching his home. Police say Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, on Dec. 2, 2015. Four hours after the rampage, the couple was shot dead by police in a gun battle on a San Bernardino street. Farook and Malik used assault rifles that the FBI says were lawfully purchased by Farook’s neighbor from a licensed dealer in 2011 and 2012. The neighbor, Enrique Marquez, pleaded guilty in February to conspiring with Farook in 2011 and 2012 to provide material support and resources to terrorists, including weapons, explosives and personnel. He is scheduled to be sentenced in August. Marquez told investigators that Farook asked him to buy the weapons because he would draw less attention. At the time, the FBI says, the men were plotting to shoot up a community college and a highway. Christopher Harper-Mercer, 26, allegedly opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, on Oct. 1, 2015, killing nine people and wounding nine others before killing himself. Harper-Mercer and his family members legally purchased the handguns and rifle he used in the murderous rampage from a federally licensed gun dealer, according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Police say Vester Lee Flanagan II, 41, shot and killed two journalists during a live on-air interview in Roanoke, Virginia, on Aug. 26, 2015. The woman being interviewed was injured in the shooting. After being apprehended by police, Flanagan shot himself and later died at a local hospital. Federal officials say Flanagan bought the handgun he used in the attack legally from a licensed dealer. He had not been convicted of a crime or determined to be mentally ill. Police say John Russell Houser, 59, opened fire inside a packed movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, on July 23, 2015, killing two people and injuring nine others before taking his own life. Investigators say Houser used a semiautomatic pistol he had legally purchased from a pawn shop in Alabama. He had been denied a state-issued concealed weapons permit in 2006 because he was accused of domestic violence and soliciting arson. Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez allegedly killed five people and wounded two after he opened fire at a pair of military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on July 16, 2015. Authorities said Abdulazeez was killed in a gunfight with police. According to the FBI, some of the weapons Abdulazeez used in the attack were purchased lawfully and some were not. It is unclear when the purchases were made and whether he was subject to a background check. Relatives told ABC News that Abdulazeez was deeply troubled and had a history of mental illness. They say he had been arrested prior to the shooting on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. And in May 2013, he failed a background check for an engineering job at a nuclear power plant in Ohio. The FBI says Dylann Roof, 21, should have never been allowed to purchase the pistol with which he killed nine people and injured one other at the historic Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof was convicted of hate crimes resulting in death, among other charges. He was sentenced to death. When Roof tried to buy a gun from a dealer in West Columbia, South Carolina, in April 2015, an FBI background check examiner found a felony drug charge in his record. But the examiner missed that Roof had actually admitted to possessing the drugs during his March 2015 arrest. That admission should have barred Roof from buying the gun, according to the FBI. After a three-day wait, the gun dealer was legally permitted to complete the transaction. Two months later, Roof went to a Bible study group at the church and opened fire with the gun.

Orlando marks 1st anniversary of Pulse massacre — -- Family and friends of those who were killed in a mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando last year gathered at the club to mark the first anniversary of the mass shooting. Forty-nine people were killed, and more than 50 others were injured on June 12, 2016, when a gunman opened fire on the gay nightclub. The city of Orlando, in collaboration with Pulse, declared today Orlando United Day: A Day of Love and Kindness. ""This day is dedicated to the memory and honor of the 49 innocent lives taken at Pulse, reaffirms the community's commitment to survivors and loved ones, as well as recognizes the global compassion and love displayed in the wake of the tragedy,"" city officials said in a statement. Army Sgt. Marie Cobbs — who attended the early Monday ceremony, which was open only to survivors and family and friends of those who were killed — told reporters Monday morning that she was too angry to go inside the now shuttered nightclub. A police officer ""was going to let me in, but I just said no. I just couldn't ... I'm too angry,"" she said. She said she was there in remembrance of her nephew Anthony, who was killed in the attack. ""Like, how could this happen?"" Cobbs asked. ""This guy came to my home right here,"" she said gesturing toward the nightclub, ""and shot my brothers and sisters."" The ceremony, which overlapped with the moment that suspected gunman Omar Mateen began firing shots, at a little after 2 a.m., will kick off a full day of services held in honor of the victims and survivors. It will be followed by three main events: a midday service held at the nightclub, an evening gathering called Orlando Love: Remembering Our Angels and a music-filled celebration held at Pulse. Churches throughout the city agreed to ring their bells simultaneously 49 times at noon. Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS during the attack and was killed in a shootout with police. His wife, Noor Salman, is facing charges of aiding and abetting and obstruction in federal court. She has pleaded not guilty. One survivor, Ricardo Negron, told The Associated Press that he would not be attending the events because it would be too difficult to bear. ""There's going to be so many things going on that I feel it will be overwhelming for those affected,"" said Negron, who managed to escape from the attack the club without physical harm. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-06-12 06:52:17, Orlando marks 1-year anniversary of Pulse massacre ,"homosexuality,police,crime and criminals,murders and attempted murders",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

442,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/talk-gun-control-notably-absent-scalise-shooting/story?id=48071504,"Capitol Hill is not pushing gun control debate following yesterday's shooting. Trump on Rep. Scalise's condition: 'He's in some trouble' — -- Members of congress, their staff and voters across the country had come to expect a rhythm that these days is perhaps petering out. For years, after a mass shooting, there would inevitably be a debate of some sort on gun control on Capitol Hill. For example, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 -- which left twenty children and six adults dead -- there was a push for stricter background checks and a limit on ammunition. And last year, following the shooting massacre at Orlando's LGBT Pulse Nightclub -- during which 49 people were killed -- Democratic members sat on the floor and demanded a vote on what seemed to be a small measure to them: purchasing access for people on non-fly, terror watch lists. But yesterday, after a gunman opened fire on some of their own congressional colleagues at a Virginia park baseball diamond, only a few Democrats fell back on familiar gun control talking points and frustration about the abundance of weapons in the U.S. Instead, by and large, the tone was different than after past tragedies. There appeared to be a sensitivity that it was not the appropriate time to fight with their colleagues over policy. And there was also a resignation, it seemed, that both parties know where the other stands, and little, if anything, could be passed on the federal level. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who led the filibusters last summer and has been a vocal advocate for stricter laws since the Sandy Hook tragedy in his state, wrote that he was glad the congressional baseball game was going forward, but he worried about how fast the country could move on from ""cataclysmic"" events? “Are we so jaundiced to gun violence and mass shootings that it only takes us twenty four hours now to revert back to business as usual?” Murphy wrote on his Facebook page. “We are becoming massively desensitized to the carnage.” Hours after the shooting, Murphy, sounded disheartened and hopeless that his colleagues in Washington would ever address the epidemic of gun violence through stricter regulations. “We’re beyond the place where Washington responds to mass shootings. I mean, we don’t. We don’t. After Orlando and Sandy Hook, that’s clearly not how people’s minds work here,” he told Politico. Former New York congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy, one of the most persistent and determined Democrats on the issue during her nine terms in office, expressed dismay during an interview with ABC News Thursday. “It is a shame that nothing is done between these horrible shootings,” she said. McCarthy’s husband was fatally shot in 1993 during a shooting rampage on a Long Island Rail Road commuter train outside New York City. The idea that talking about policies after a shooting was seen as somehow politicizing a tragedy still makes McCarthy defensive. “We can’t talk about it any other time. Nobody listens to us. It just dies,” she said. “When was the last time you heard about anyone trying to do anything when there isn’t a mass shooting of any sort? The subject just won’t come up."" She argued, almost disparagingly, that if Democrats think they have a chance at taking back the majority of the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms, she thought they were even less likely to push the issue. In fact, it was Republicans instead yesterday who talked about possible policy solutions. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Texas, who was at the practice during the shooting suggested it would have been better if more people on the scene had guns to shot back at the assailant. “We had no arms, all we had were bats,” he said during a press conference. “We were sitting ducks.” Representative Tom Garrett, R-Va., spoke to the New York Times about a bill he introduced in March that would make it easier for people to carry a gun and “allow the most law-abiding among us to defend themselves.” On the one hand, McCarthy said she was glad there was talk of bipartisanship and calming the political rhetoric after yesterday's shooting, but she also sounded disappointed watching the coverage of Capitol Hill. “Towards the end of my career, I thought, ‘Could we stop praying for everybody who gets shot or injured and just do something about it? That is how frustrated you get and I know most victims feel the same way,” she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-06-15 20:27:15, Talk of gun control notably absent following Scalise shooting,"education and schools,politics and government,crime and criminals,firearms",39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

444,http://abcnews.go.com/US/disgruntled-employee-kills-workplace-orlando-police/story?id=47838338,"The situation is contained. Disgruntled worker returns to job, kills 5 people and himself in Florida — -- Five people were shot and killed by a ""disgruntled"" former employee at a workplace near Orlando, Florida, this morning, three years after the suspect was involved in another workplace violence incident there, authorities said. The suspect shot and killed himself after shooting his former co-workers this morning at Fiamma, which is part of an Italian company that manufactures awnings and accessories for RVs, authorities said. Most victims were shot in the head and some were shot multiple times, according to Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings. The active shooting was reported at about 8:03 a.m. Deputies arrived minutes later to find three men and one woman dead, Demings said. A fifth person, a man, was taken to a hospital where he died, Demings said. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old John Robert Neumann Jr., was allegedly ""singling out"" victims, Demings said. When Neumann encountered a young woman who was a temporary employee, he allegedly pointed the gun at her and told her to get out of the business, Demings said. It appears Neumann reloaded at least once during the shooting spree, Demings added. Eight people inside the business survived, Demings said. Demings described the suspect as a ""disgruntled"" former employee who was fired in April 2017. In 2014, authorities responded to Fiamma when Neumann was involved in another workplace violence incident, in which he allegedly battered another employee, Demings said. No charges were filed at that time, Demings said. There's no indication that the suspect was a member of any terror organization, Demings said, adding that this was ""likely a workplace violence incident."" It appears that the person he was accused of battering in 2014 was not one of the victims today, the sheriff said. Shelley Adams told ABC News that her sister, a Fiamma employee, saw someone lying on the floor as she walked out of the bathroom. She was ""just hysterically crying,"" Adams said of her sister, who called her on the phone. ""She kept saying, 'My boss is dead.'"" The victims were identified as Robert Snyder, 69; Brenda Montanez-Crespo, 44; Kevin Clark, 53; Jeffrey Roberts, 57; Kevin Lawson, 46. Neumann was a U.S. Army veteran who was discharged honorably in 1999, Demings said. He lived alone and has no family in the area, Demings said. Next week marks the one-year anniversary of the June 12, 2016, mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that killed 49 people. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said in a statement, ""Over the past year, the Orlando community has been challenged like never before."" ""I ask all Floridians to pray for the families impacted by this senseless act of violence,"" Scott said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2017-06-05 11:14:24, Disgruntled former employee kills 5 at Florida workplace,murders and attempted murders,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

6.19.2017 9:59 PM Congress is considering the ""Hearing Protection Act,"" which would change federal regulation of gun ""silencers."" Here's a guide to some of the basic facts and relevant laws on the subject. What is a ""silencer""? Properly speaking, the devices are called ""suppressors"" or ""moderators,"" because guns that use them are still very loud, as will be detailed below. A sound suppressor is based on the principle you can see in a bathtub drain. Because water swirls when it goes down the drain, the rate of water flow is less than if the water just went straight down. The same principle can be applied to a gas. In a firearm, the bullet is propelled through the barrel and out the muzzle by expanding gas from burning gunpowder. As the gas exits the muzzle, it makes a very loud noise. If gas swirls on the way out, it exits more slowly. The slower exit reduces the noise of the gunshot. Thus, a suppressor is a simple canister attached to the gun muzzle. Inside the canister are baffles, which make the gas swirl, producing less sound. The first sound moderator came to market in 1909, under the name ""Maxim Silencer."" The name was marketing hyperbole, like calling a flannel shirt an ""Arctic coat."" The inventor, Hiram Percy Maxim, also applied his noise-moderating system to automobile mufflers and other machines whose gas emissions create noise. Today, the company Maxim Silencers does not make firearms silencers, but it does produce noise reducers for many other applications. Noise reduction made shooting more pleasant in the short run, and protected hearing in the long run. President Theodore Roosevelt  put a Maxim Silencer on his 1894 Winchester lever-action rifle. How much is the noise reduced? By  up to 30 decibels, depending on the type of gun, ammunition and suppressor. Currently, gun control lobbies are claiming that if ""silencers"" are available, people will not be able to hear a mass shooting that is going on nearby. To test the claim, let's consider last week's attack on Republicans who were practicing baseball in Alexandria. The criminal used a SKS rifle, with 7.62mm ammunition. Without a suppressor, the sound of a shot from such a gun is 165 decibels. This is more than twice as loud as a jet take-off, if you are 25 meters from the jet. With a suppressor, the SKS would be about 140db. That's equivalent to being on an active aircraft carrier deck. The would-be assassin also had a Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun. In handguns, 9mm is an intermediate caliber—smaller and quieter than larger calibers such as .44 or .45 (inches). Without a suppressor, the S&W handgun is about 157 to 160 db. With a suppressor, that handgun would be around 127 to 130 db. That's about the same as a jackhammer. Thus, the assertions that people will not be able to hear criminal gunfire are not well supported by physics, although the assertions are consistent with how ""silencers"" are portrayed in movies. (The specific decibel levels for particular guns were supplied by Jeremy Mallette, director of social media for Silencer Shop, a company in Austin.) Advocacy for banning silencers. In the early 20th century, the most influential advocate for banning many firearms and accessories was William T. Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo. Using the resources of the Bronx Zoo and others for conservation, Hornaday helped save the American bison from extinction. Hornaday's 1913 book, ""Our Vanishing Wildlife: Its Extermination and Preservation,"" warned that over-hunting was wiping out American wildlife. According to Hornaday, one problem was that modern guns were too accurate. Also, hunters now had better scopes and binoculars. In Wyoming, hunters were using silencers so one shot didn't frighten away other game. Even worse, in Hornaday's view, was who was hunting. Namely, lower-class Americans and immigrants. He urged new laws to ""prohibit the use of firearms by any naturalized alien from southern Europe until after a 10-years' residence in America."" Wildlife was vanishing because ""the Italians are spreading, spreading, spreading. If you are without them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. Meet them at the threshold with drastic laws, thoroughly enforced."" In the South, Hornaday argued, the problem was hunting by ""poor white trash"" and blacks. In an earlier time, black Americans ""were too poor to own guns."" But ""the time came when . . . single-shot breech-loading guns went down to five dollars a piece. The negro had money now, and the merchants . . . sold him the guns, a gun for every black idler, man and boy, in all the South."" Hornaday favored an Alabama proposal for an annual tax of at least $5 a year on every firearm, to prevent poor people from owning inexpensive guns. Hornaday argued that all pump-action guns should be banned, as should all semi-automatics and all ""silencers."" Some of Hornaday's proposals did become law, in attenuated form. For example, states did not ban hunting by immigrant citizens, but they did enact laws against hunting or firearms possession by legal resident aliens. North Carolina enacted a statute (later repealed) that required a license for purchasing a pump action gun. (These laws are described in my article in the Harvard Journal on Legislation, Background Checks for Firearms Sales and Loans: Law, History, and Policy.) The National Firearms Act of 1934. In 1934, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act, which used the tax power to set up a tax and registration system for certain arms and accessories. As enacted, the NFA applies to machine guns, short-barreled shotguns and rifles, ""silencers,"" grenades, mortars and various other devices. As introduced in Congress, the NFA also covered handguns, which prompted a tremendous debate. Once handguns were removed from the bill, the NFA passed with little opposition. In the legislative history, there was no discussion of ""silencers."" We simply have no idea what (if anything) Congress thought it was doing about them. See Stephen P. Halbrook, Firearm Sound Moderators: Issues of Criminalization and the Second Amendment, 46 Cumberland Law Rev. 33 (2016). Pursuant to the NFA, purchasing a suppressor today requires a $200 tax. Before a person takes possession of a suppressor, the suppressor must go through a months-long registration process with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Gun Control Act of 1968. As amended, the 1968 Act is the main federal law for ordinary firearms. For the GCA, suppressors are treated the same as ordinary firearms. Thus, the retail purchaser must fill out the dozens of questions in the four-page federal Form 4473, which includes questions about the purchaser's race, and whether the purchaser is Hispanic. A false answer on the 4473 is punishable by five years in federal prison. 18 U.S. Code 924(a)(1). The Form 4473 functions as a registration system, since the dealer must retain the form. The dealer's registration forms may be examined by law enforcement officials in the course of criminal investigations or during regulatory compliance inspections. 18 U.S. Code 923(g). Once the 4473 has been completed, the retailer contacts the FBI or a state counterpart by Internet or by telephone. The law enforcement agency conducts a background check by comparing the buyer's name to various lists of ""prohibited persons."" These include persons with felony convictions, domestic violence misdemeanors, illegal aliens, dishonorable discharges from the military, and so on. Sometimes the ""instant check"" is completed in less than 20 minutes. Other times, the wait time to initiate the check can be hours or days. If the lawful buyer has the same name as a prohibited person, there may be delays of days or months. To repeat: A suppressor purchaser must go through the same procedures as an ordinary firearms buyer (Gun Control Act) and the same procedures as a machine gun buyer (National Firearms Act). This is an unusually stringent pair of systems. Most firearms accessories (e.g., scopes) have no special rules for purchase. The default rule is to have controls on the firearm, and not to bother with extra rules for accessories. State laws. As long as a person complies with the NFA and the GCA, suppressor ownership is legal in almost all states. The exceptions are Hawaii, California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In the 42 states where suppressors are legal, they are allowed for hunting in all but two (Connecticut and Vermont). (See this map from the American Suppressor Association.) The number of states that allow possession of suppressors, including for hunting, has grown in recent years, in part due to the lobbying of the NFA Freedom Alliance, a group that concentrates on items covered by the NFA. Why do people own suppressors? There are three main reasons: reduction of noise pollution, hearing protection, and safety training. As for the first, hunting sometimes take place in state or national forests or other locations near where people live. During hunting season, nearby residents may be annoyed by the frequent sound of gunfire. Likewise, some people have built houses near established target ranges; when people at the range use suppressors, the ambient noise is reduced, although certainly not eliminated. In the 1950s, many shooters did not use hearing protection. As people have become more health conscious, they have recognized that gunfire can damage the inner ear. Accordingly, use of hearing protection when shooting has become standard and is mandatory at public ranges. Earmuffs reduce the felt decibel level by about 20 to 30 decibels, depending on the model. Today, best practices are to supplement over-the-ear muffs with foam inserts into the ear. By themselves, ear plugs are usually not as effective as earmuffs, but they do provide some additional protection. Suppressors reduce noise by about as much as earmuffs do. No one would ever suggest that a suppressor is an acceptable replacement for muffs, but suppressors are a very good supplement to reduce the sound the reaches the inner ear. Using a suppressor + earmuffs + ear plugs can reduce the perceived sound to around 100 decibels, the same as a power lawn mower. Finally, firearms safety instructors often prefer that their students use suppressors. First of all, suppressors reduce overall noise, which makes it easier for students to hear the instructor. Second, some new shooters flinch because of the sharp noise of a gun when it is fired. A suppressor can prevent a flinch from developing and thus help students progress more quickly to proper and safe shooting form. How many people own suppressors? As of November 2006, the number of suppressors in the ATF's registry was 150,364. By February 2016, the number had risen to 902,805. These numbers are not as precise as they might appear, since the ATF has acknowledged that its National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record registry (NFRTR) is riddled with errors; items that were properly registered with the ATF at some point may not appear on the current ATF registry. Regardless, there is no doubt that suppressors have become much more popular, especially with hunters, as CNN has reported. What is the rate of crime with suppressors? A study of federal prosecutions for 1995-2005 , using Westlaw and Lexis, found 153 total ""silencer"" prosecutions. ""[M]ore than 80 percent of federal silencer charges are for non-violent, victimless crimes."" Paul A. Clark, Criminal Use of Firearms Silencers, 8 Western Criminology Review 44 (2007). In other words, the possessor was a prohibited person (not allowed to possess firearms, ammunition or silencers), but the possessor was not misusing the item. In only 2 percent of the cases was the firearm discharged. The author noted that most prosecutions involved improvised, home-made silencers, rather than the commercially manufactured kind that can be purchased in gun stores. The article's analysis of California cases from 2000-2005 found similar results. Thus, the misuse rate for lawfully purchased suppressors appears to be very low. What are the laws in other countries? American suppressor law is anomalous, because suppressors are accessories yet are treated the same as firearms (Gun Control Act). On top of that, they are also treated like machine guns (National Firearms Act). As Halbrook's article details, in European nations such as Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Britain, among others, an individual who is licensed to own a firearm is always allowed the appropriate suppressor. Many European guns are sold with suppressors already attached. The policy is that if a person is legally authorized to possess a firearm, then it is generally preferable for that firearm to have a suppressor. What is the Hearing Protection Act? In the current Congress, the Hearing Protection Act (HPA) is H.R. 367 in the House (sponsored by Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C.) and S, 59 in the Senate (sponsored by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho). The HPA retains all of the Gun Control Act's provisions on suppressors. In other words, purchasing a suppressor would continue to be subject to all the rules that apply to purchasing or possessing an ordinary firearm. The HPA removes suppressors from the National Firearms Act, which means buyers would not have to pay a $200 tax and would not have to go through a months-long federal registration process. The HPA does not preempt the laws in the states that prohibit suppressor possession. It does say that in states where suppressors are lawful, states may not impose additional registration requirements or special taxes. To get the Volokh Conspiracy Daily e-mail, please sign up here.

446,https://www.thedailybeast.com/marc-maron-on-obama-gun-violence-and-the-great-american-asshole-donald-trump,"SEARCH For years, the comic has mostly refused to talk about politics on his podcast or in his stand-up comedy. But that doesn’t mean he’s run out of opinions on Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and more. Senior Writer 2015 was a big year for Marc Maron. He got President Barack Obama to come to his garage in Highland Park, Los Angeles for an hour-long podcast interview that prompted yet another national discussion on race. He traveled to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City to confront Lorne Michaels about why he didn’t get a coveted SNL gig 20 years ago. And this Friday, December 4, his second major stand-up special in three years makes its debut on the Epix channel. Maron is known for being a particularly angry comic, but he has noticeably mellowed with recent success. For example, his new special includes an entire bit about how much he loves ice cream. His WTF podcast, which just aired its 660th episode this week, regularly tops the iTunes charts and has managed to turn his career around in a way that nothing else could. For the first time in recent years, fans are actually paying to see him perform live. Even if, as he has mentioned on the podcast numerous times, an outsized portion of them are slightly depressed loners who purchase single tickets. When The Daily Beast caught up with Maron as he was stuck in Los Angeles traffic this week, some of that signature anger shone through an otherwise pleasant disposition. As the GPS on his phone kept interrupting his train of thought, he exclaimed, “How the fuck do I turn that off?” and later, “I don’t know how the fuck to turn this down, man.” A previously announced TV interview series with VICE, to be titled VICE Portraits, recently fell through, but he has so much else going on right now, from his IFC show Maron, which recently ended its third season, to memorable appearances on such critical hits as Louie and Girls, that it doesn’t seem to phase him. “That’s not happening,” he explains. “I had a time window and they didn’t have a network and the time ran out.” Ultimately, it’s VICE’s loss. Below is the condensed and edited conversation, in which Maron discussed the state of his comedy, his frustration with our political system and how he really has achieved some form of inner peace, despite the occasional outburst. It can be a little bit intimidating interviewing someone who has conducted so many incredible interviews over the past several years. Have you been particularly nervous to interview any of your recent podcast guests? I get nervous all the time for different reasons, you know. Sometimes I don’t know what I’m going to talk to somebody about. I don’t know how it’s going to begin or I don’t know the bulk of how it’s going to go, because I don’t really lay it out. I’m just kind of flying by the seat of my pants in terms of, hopefully, having a conversation evolve. Then other times I’m nervous about doing justice to someone who has had a particularly long career, or maybe I’m just nervous because I’m intimidated by somebody’s work. I’m always nervous for one reason or another. Let’s move on to your new special. A lot of it is about how you either express or try to control your anger, yet I’ve noticed in some of your podcast intros, you seem a lot more content than you used to be. What is that balance like in your real, everyday life? Well, I have enough peace of mind now to make different choices around my anger. You know there are some things in my life now that have never been there. There’s a certain amount of self-esteem that comes from doing something that people enjoy or that seems relevant or having accomplished something. I’m earning a living, which is something I’ve experienced not doing for years sometimes, so that is another piece to a peace of mind puzzle. But then what you’re left with is the sort of core wiring that is provoked or that activates anger and some of that runs pretty deep. So, it really is about making choices and figuring out what that is and why those feelings come. And a lot of times, it’s really just what we’re used to on a very deep level. It’s what is actually comfortable with us, and that’s the tragedy of being anxious or neurotic or angry. It’s something that we’re wired with and it feels like home to us. So to overcome it, it’s very cognitive. You have be like, “That feeling’s happening. I want to fucking snap, but why don’t we just ride it out?” Keep it inside and maybe it will pass. Just practical tools. But a lot of it is still there, it’s just that I know better. And a lot of it’s not connected to anything, so I’m more careful with it. In the epilogue to the special, you talk about how you don’t want to ‘divide people’ with your comedy. Can you expand on that a little bit? Is that something you see in other stand-ups and try to avoid? Look, I’ve done political comedy, I’ve done very opinionated comedy, I’ve done comedy in my life that was in its nature offensive. And as I’ve gotten older and detached myself from politics and even from pop culture to a certain degree, I just find that I can share my experience of personal struggles, which are emotional, psychological, and experiential. That’s the most honest thing I can share. And I think in varying degrees, most people, or certainly the people that are going to connect with me, also experience those things. There are plenty of people who are going to go, “That guy’s a whiner, that guy is just angry, that guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about.” Fine. That’s always going to happen. I’m not trying to please everybody, but I am trying to be honest and true to my own self enough that people feel that they can relate to it. One of the great things that comedy can do is make people go, “Oh shit, I thought I was the only one who felt that.” Or, “I never thought of it that way.” Or, “I’m not alone.” Laughter that is connected to those three things is powerful stuff. And it’s very satisfying for me to experience that connection with people. That’s a more positive view of comedy than you maybe had when you started your career. No, I always felt that comedy could blow minds and offer people a certain point of view that may disarm things that are terrifying or overwhelming or incomprehensible. I always knew that it could do that. It’s just finding your own place within it. And in different points in my career I was more fueled by self-righteousness or anger or an assumption that I knew more than other people. I sort of wandered around the terrain of anger and enlightenment and political awareness and having an extreme point of view for effect. But you get older and certain things that used to seem so important kind of fade a bit and you’re sort of left with an existential reality that you deal with on a day-to-day basis. The more personal I can be, the less possibility there is of me crossing streams with somebody or talking about something within pop culture that everybody has a similar take on. I just listened to your interview with Gloria Steinem, and you asked her about the impact of political correctness on comedy. I’m curious to know where you stand on that issue these days. Comics like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Maher have accused audiences of being too sensitive. Is that something you’ve experienced with your crowd? And does it affect what you decide to joke about at all? There is a timidity of younger people in terms of what they should or shouldn’t be sensitive to. There’s a self-censorship that’s based on a vague paranoia of not wanting to offend anybody. And I think sometimes that’s a little dangerous. But I think having a discussion about that is not unreasonable….If you’re saying things just to push a point, just to create a controversy, you know what you’re doing. If you say something that is a mistake or has hurt a community’s feelings, then it’s on you to either defend it or apologize for it. It’s really just about taking personal responsibility. I don’t really believe in censorship in any way, but I do believe it is appropriate to be sensitive. If you still want to say something that is hurtful and challenging and you have a reason for doing it, and if you can defend that reason, do it. Say whatever the fuck you want, that’s part of the beauty of the freedom that we have, but you may have to take responsibility for it, so be prepared for that too. But I do think there is a profound amount of hyper-sensitivity that might be detrimental to emotional growth, both culturally and otherwise. Can you talk a little bit about how the recent Lorne Michaels interview and how that came together? Why was it so important to you and what wisdom or closure do you think you gained from the conversation? I’ve been relatively obsessed with a meeting I had with Lorne Michaels in ‘95 for a long time, in terms of what really happened there and what I remember and you know, what my life would have been like had it gone differently. And I had a certain feeling about him that had become malignant in my mind over time. But to actually be able to sit down with him and talk to him about that meeting, which he seemed to remember, it certainly provided a certain amount of closure. And there was one beautiful moment in it that I thought was great and well played on his part. The part about his condescending — what I perceived as a condescending comment about what we were doing below 14th street not mattering. And in the interview, he said something to the extent of, “I was trying to help you. I was just trying save you some time.” [Laughs.] I thought that was very funny. But ultimately, I felt great and I liked him and I saw him as a person, with a job that he’s had for a long time. I saw him as a lifer, a TV lifer. Outside of the fact that he has a tremendous amount of power and a tremendous amount of money, he loves television and that’s his job. And to see him as a guy with a job, with a system and a world that he operates in, was very humanizing for me. So it definitely worked out in terms of me getting some closure, but also finding some respect in a way that I didn’t really have and have now. And then of course, slightly less monumental than Lorne, was the interview with President Obama. The media immediately seized on his use of the “n-word” as the only thing they wanted to talk about. Did you know when that moment happened that it would get so much attention? No, I’m not usually very good at that. My producer, Brendan McDonald, is very acutely aware of those things. I knew he said it. But I’m a comic and discussions about that word or being around people that use that word — primarily black people — I didn’t think like, “Oh my God!” But it was sort of jarring and it was powerful and I think that in saying it in the context that he did, to make a point about using that word in the context of racial progress was a powerful thing. The tabloid media is going to do what it’s going to do, but I think he had a context that was a service to the conversation. The distinction that was kind of lost in the media was that people were saying he “used” the n-word, when in reality he said it in a very specific context. So I think that was the kind of nuance that can be gained in long podcast interview that was completely lost when people picked out that one moment. Yeah, because people don’t take the time to process. They impulsively react and that seems to be enough for a lot of people. Because of that, was there anything in that interview that you think got lost or buried because that singular focus happened? I don’t know, I had nothing to do with that. I don’t know how many people listened — well I do know how many people downloaded it — I don’t know how many people processed that whole interview. It was downloaded, I think, close to three million times. And I got very little bad feedback from the left or the right. I got some people saying, “I don’t like him, but that was great.” Or I got some people saying, “I forgot how much I liked him.” Or I got some people saying, “I like him now.” But there was very little hate. I was prepared for people thinking it was some sort of soft interview, but I thought it was very nuanced. I sort of intentionally avoided policy, because I didn’t want to get lost. I wanted to stay connected to him. And he knew when he was getting in the weeds. You’re dealing with a guy who has a fairly articulated position on most things and I wanted to get around that as much as possible. But it was a necessity to deal with what happened in Charleston because it was literally two days after that. And there was no way we couldn’t talk about that and a couple of other things that were going to be breaking the following week. But outside of that, we were able to change gears and we were able to have a lot of candid and nuanced conversations about fear and the job of president and about his family. And also the tone of it was unlike anything we’d really heard before [from him]. You mentioned Charleston. And now we’ve had this latest mass shooting in San Bernardino, California yesterday. What do you make of the country’s seeming inability to deal with the gun problem in any way? Now that people are describing this latest incident as terrorism, do you think that will somehow spur more action? [Pauses.] Well, the fact that it remains a political problem is troubling. This is really about fear on behalf of Americans about being armed or not being armed. And I don’t really know how you resolve that other than putting more restrictions on gun ownership and more thorough background checks, and all the stuff that has been suggested by people who are rightfully opposed to how easy it is to get guns. When and if Americans have had enough of something, it’s very hard to say. It’s just a sad fact that there’s such a stalemate around progress on this issue. Whatever the agenda is of any person shooting innocent people, whether it’s impulsive or whether it’s planned, whether it’s based on mental illness or an ideological agenda, what these people think constitutes their freedom basically puts them and everybody else in so much fear that our freedom is actually compromised because we can’t make reasonable decisions around guns. Amy Schumer recently jumped into this issue after there was a shooting at a screening of Trainwreck. I know you’ve really left politics behind since your days at Air America. Do things happen in this country that make you want to start talking about politics again or are you happy to leave it behind? There are political issues that affect everybody. But how do you get everybody to access the feelings that are necessary to create an urgency around any political issue that is really based on human progress? It becomes very tricky. So if I can attach my personal experience to some sort of logic around political issues, I’ll do it. I just don’t want to be in the dialogue because that just becomes a ridiculous fight of punditry that doesn’t seem to go anywhere. A lot of people seem to find that as entertaining as watching sports and picking teams. At some point you would hope that if Americans have the desire to live with a quality of life that is tolerant and progressive in terms of being civilized, it would happen. I guess I romanticize the idea that I still believe most people are innately good. I think a lot of people are distracted and self-involved, and I may be one of those people, but I never feel that I want to get into the political dialogue again because I think you end up honoring a dialogue that may not be your own, just to service a political system that is corrupted in a lot of ways. But I think what’s going on certainly with regard to guns, gun violence, terrorists, lunatics, even police gun violence to some degree, is disturbing and it’s heinous and it’s frightening. And I hope that something gives, but it’s hard to be optimistic when something like [the San Bernardino shooting] happens. On a personal level, are there any 2016 candidates that you are excited about in either a positive or negative way? I don’t want a Republican. [Laughs] I love a lot of what Bernie [Sanders] has to say and he’s created a dialogue around certain issues that this country needs to hear in a practical way. I don’t know how many people are hearing it. I think it would be exciting to have a woman as president and Hillary [Clinton], I would be OK with that. Talking to Obama, it’s a very difficult job, most of the people that can do that job or are voted to do that job cannot really fulfill their vision. Most of them are paying a lot of lip service to things they know they can’t do in order to get to where they want to be. So there’s a lot of bullshit involved in all of it. Ultimately, I’d like the country to move in a direction where there’s less angry people and less poor people and a little more justice and a little more fairness and a little more access to basic human services for everybody. I want all those things. Unfortunately, it’s very slow going in, theoretically, the most advanced country in the world. So is it safe to say you don’t think Donald Trump is up to that task? Donald Trump’s a clown. He’s a very traditional, populist, American clown. And whatever he’s doing seems to be fragmenting and befuddling the entire Republican [party], so that’s fine. But I don’t see him as a serious candidate even if other people do. I think that if somebody like Donald Trump actually got into office, he would very quickly be emasculated and neutered by Congress, probably his own Congress. So, whatever, he’s a great American asshole and it’s making people excited. Probably the wrong people, but what are you going to do? What do you think explains that excitement? What is it about the American people that make them want someone like Trump? They’re angry! And many of them, this is not what they expected in their life and in their country. Some of them are nostalgic for an America that I don’t even think existed, ever. I think it was always just an idea, this idea that everything was OK for everybody. Whoever speaks to rage and relieves it somehow with their rhetoric will be popular in the hearts of excited, angry people who feel like they’ve been dealt a bad hand. Now that you’ve interviewed the president and Lorne Michaels, who looms large as a guest that you haven’t been able to get on the podcast yet that you would really like to talk to? There’s always people I want to talk to. I’m talking to William Friedkin on Saturday, I’m excited about that. I’d like to talk to Albert Brooks at some point. I just interviewed Todd Haynes, the director. There’s always people that I find interesting and that do things I’m interested in or can learn from. But for some reason I’m mildly obsessed with Albert Brooks and I don’t think that’s ever going to happen. I don’t think he wants to do it, it’s just not something he does. Leading up to the Lorne Michaels interview, you joked about it being the end of your podcast. Can you imagine a time when you would actually let it go? No, because it’s sort of the core of what I do: stand-up and the podcast. I see other things — my life on television in a fictional way [on IFC’s Maron]. Acting, I’m OK at it, I’d like to try a little more of that. But the podcast is something I have complete creative control over, as well as my comedy. And I like having that. I like having time, for however long it lasts, where people want to see me and want to listen to the podcast. So as long as that audience is out there, I’ll keep working...I do have fantasies of going entirely off the grid and just living peacefully, but a lot of people think that’s some sort of weird dream of mine that’s impossible.

Anyone watching Sessions testifying before his former Senate colleagues – as he liked to call them, before they hurled all kinds of calumnies in his direction – was surely shocked by how often the attorney general has had to endure such indignities. Who could expect this fine man to live by the common standards of recusal? It’s quite outrageous to think that recusal from the Russia investigation means he had to recuse himself from firing someone for the Russia investigation. The normal rules do not apply to Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Charles M. Blow at The New York Times writes—Rhetoric and bullets: In 2011, after Representative Gabby Giffords of Arizona was gravely injured and six others were killed by a shooter in Tucson, I was moved to commit an entire column to condemning the left for linking the shooting so closely to political rhetoric. [...] Now, here I am again, only this time extending the same condemnation to the right for doing the same after four people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, were shot at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field where Republican members of Congress were practicing in advance of a charity game. [...] The very real possibility that the shooting was politically motivated was clearly on the minds of many, including Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who was at the baseball field during the shooting: “This could be the first political rhetorical terrorist attack, and that has to stop.” Let me be clear: I don’t have a problem with viewing these incidents through a political lens. Not to do so is naïve and ridiculously self-blinding in a way that avoids reality. Martin Longman at Washington Monthly writes—Fox News Drops Claim to Be Fair and Balanced: The rise of Donald Trump has been almost as disruptive to Fox News as it has been for the country and the world. Add in the disgrace and death of Roger Ailes, the firing of Bill O’Reilly, and the departure of Fox staples Megyn Kelly and Greta Van Susteren, and the faux news network hardly resembles its old self. The latest development drives home the contrast. As Fox News moves further into the post–Roger Ailes era, the network is shedding one of its most iconic elements. According to network executives, Fox News has abandoned the marketing slogan “Fair & Balanced.” The decision was made last August after Ailes’s ouster by Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy, because the phrase had “been mocked,” one insider said. Of course, the “Fair and Balanced” motto has been mocked from the beginning. What’s changed is some kind of self-consciousness about being ridiculous. The network will remain far right, at least for now, but it’s not going to go to such absurd lengths to pretend otherwise. What they’re going to do is stick with “Most Watched. Most Trusted.” We could ask “most trusted by whom?” but a better challenge might be to examine if they remain the most watched. E.J. Dionne Jr. at The Washington Post writes—The GOP’s fantastically anti-democratic quest to kill health care in the dark: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell once had passionate views about how carefully Congress should consider sweeping changes to the health-care system. “Fast-tracking a major legislative overhaul such as health care reform or a new national energy tax without the benefit of a full and transparent debate does a disservice to the American people,” McConnell said in 2009, referring to the two big issues of the moment. Democrats using such means, he added, “would make it absolutely clear they intend to carry out their plans on a purely partisan basis.” Republican hypocrisy is now so rampant that it’s typically ignored or, worse, granted the political class’s all-purpose form of absolution: “Everybody does it.” But everybody doesn’t do it. McConnell is trying to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act using methods completely at odds with how the law was originally brought to life in the early Obama administration. The ACA was debated for more than a year and went through an elaborate hearing and amendment process that included some changes urged by Republicans. By contrast, the bill Senate Republicans are writing is being held as close as the nuclear codes William M. Buzbee at The New York Times writes—Regulatory ‘Reform’ That Is Anything But: After decades of failed efforts to enact “regulatory reform” bills, Congress appears to be within a few votes of approving reform legislation that would strip Americans of important legal protections, induce regulatory sclerosis and subject agencies that enforce the nation’s laws and regulations to potentially endless litigation. This is not reform. These bills would sabotage agency regulation with legislative monkey wrenches. Key compromises about agency power and procedures, worked out under the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, would be discarded by these overwhelmingly anti-regulatory bills. And because they would be statutory changes, not mere presidential edicts, these changes would likely long outlive the Trump administration. It is easy to complain about regulation, of course, and much could surely be improved. But government rules are the foundation of the safety net that protects Americans. Joshua Matz at The Guardian writes—Trump is ushering in a kleptocracy. That's why he is being sued: When Donald Trump announced his Muslim ban on 27 January, pandemonium erupted. Lawyers everywhere raced to airports. Galvanized by Trump’s threat to liberty, they rapidly assembled legal theories and commenced a still unbroken siege of Trump’s bigoted policy. As attorneys stockpiled caffeine, the American people rallied by moonlight outside terminals and federal courts. The legal response to Trump’s emoluments clause violations has taken shape more slowly. And understandably so: until recently, most Americans had never heard of “emoluments”. Only in the past few months – aided by creative public artand a high-profile lawsuit – has the public come to appreciate that Trump’s conflicts of interest are forbidden by the constitution. It’s no coincidence that this arcane issue has newfound salience. We’re now witnessing kleptocracy on an unprecedented scale in America. And there’s barely even a fig leaf of cover. Trump has openly enmeshed his private financial interests in national policy. To say that this creates an appearance of corruption would be far too polite. This is the real deal: sketchy dealings all the way down. [...] Anti-kleptocracy cases initially got off to a slow start under Trump. But the pace of suits attacking his conflicts will increase as these issues move to the core of our national agenda. With private plaintiffs, states and federal legislators before them, courts will soon have to decide whether to order Trump to follow the constitution. Susanne Ramirez de Arellano at The Guardian writes—Puerto Rican statehood is sold as a cure-all. That's a pipe dream: Puerto Ricans went to the polls last Sunday in yet another attempt to find a solution to the dilemma that has plagued the island for more than two centuries of colonial rule: should the US territory put all its eggs in one basket and seek to become the country’s 51st state? The 11 June plebiscite status vote was the fifth since 1967. All of them were nonbinding referendums that sought to find a permanent solution to the status of the island – a US colony since 1898. None of them pushed the needle forward at all. It is doubtful that this latest incarnation will. Jeet Heer at The New Republic writes—How Congress Can Fight Political Violence: As Lois Beckett argued in the Guardian earlier this year, “In one mass shooting after another, some gun control advocates and journalists see a common thread: when domestic violence is not the immediate cause of a mass shooting, it was there as a warning sign in the history of the perpetrator.” New York magazine’s Rebecca Traister, writing last year after the cargo-truck attack in Nice, France, argued that if Republicans “are truly looking to stem terrorism and mass violence of the sort that happened in Nice, they might do better to look to a different kind of litmus test: domestic violence and grievances against women.” If this analysis is right, then there are reasonably bipartisan policy options available to elected officials in Congress—allocating funds for anger management programs, for instance, and restricting gun ownership to those with a history of domestic violence. Since some of these killers also have a history of mental illness, Republicans should support policies that improve access to affordable mental health services. America is a Darwinian society where troubled individuals too easily fall through the cracks rather than get the treatment they need. It’s also a society where guns are readily attainable and affordable. Finally, it’s a society where politics is becoming increasingly polarized. Thus, it shouldn’t be surprising that people prone to violence are latching onto political rhetoric to give meaning to their anger. But if there is no solution to such polarization, and limited solutions to the prevalence of guns, then the least America’s lawmakers can do is propose policies to help troubled people. Alexandra Petri atThe Washington Post discovers an alternative version of J.B. Sessions’ memory-”loss” testimony: Sessions: Hello. I have come here to challenge the Senate to a duel for impugning my HONOR! Here is my rapier! Where may I toss this gauntlet? Whom may I strike with a cane? Indeed, throwing a gauntlet would be too good for you.
Mark Warner: What year were you born? It says 1946, but that literally cannot be right. You just announced that your honor had been impugned scurrilously.
Sessions: Sir, sir, I must protest! You dishonor this elegant marble hall. You call yourself a Virginian? Fiddle-dee-dee! I do not think you have earned the name.
Richard Burr: So you were on President Trump’s foreign policy team?
Sessions: Frankly, I think calling it a coordinated foreign policy team is a little strong. I would call it more of a — are you familiar with the term “garbage fire”? George Zornick at The Nation writes—Progressive insurgents should take note of what worked for Tom Perriello in Virginia—and what didn’t: In the grand sweep of things, Tuesday night’s Democratic primary in Virginia was an enormous victory for the left. Former representative Tom Perriello came out of nowhere late in the process, staked out a starkly progressive agenda predicated on fighting inequality and racism, and racked up 41 percent of the vote. The winner, Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam, moved left throughout the primary and is likely the most progressive Democratic nominee in the history of Virginia. Perriello’s run directly moved Northam to the left on several issues. When Perriello announced he was running on a $15 minimum wage, he was the the first candidate for statewide office ever to make that pledge—and Northam quickly became the second just one day later. Perriello made free community college a centerpiece of his campaign very early on, and Northam later came out with a free-community-college proposal for certain high-demand jobs. When Northam went after Perriello, it was usually to ding the former congressman for being insufficiently progressive on both gun control and abortion rights. Northam wasn’t the preferred candidate of many activist left groups, but still stands in stark contrast to past Democratic nominees and governors. Brian Beutler at The New Republic writes—Trump’s Scandals Are Making Republicans More Dangerous: The odor of corruption and criminality engulfing the Trump administration has forced Democrats in Congress to oppose the president on two fronts—one in the realm of legislation, and another in the realm of oversight. Complicating matters further is the fact that the nature of the two fights are thematic opposites. The investigations of the Trump Organization and Russian meddling in the 2016 election are overwrought with dramatic tension. Explosive new details spill out on a near-daily basis, as one witness after another—former FBI Director James Comey last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week—testifies before the Senate. Legislation and oversight are equally important congressional prerogatives, each of enormous public interest, but only the latter is producing big news at the moment. That is in large part due to the extraordinary, scandalous steps Republicans are taking to advance legislation that would take health insurance away from millions. Senate Republicans have all but completed a secret bill, the precise contents of which are only known to the 13 men who drafted it, the analysts at the Congressional Budget Office (who are duty-bound not to leak), and, in all likelihood, health industry lobbyists, whose influence in this instance is as opaque as the legislation itself. The process is secretive precisely to limit the number of bombshell stories that can be told about it—to keep the media in the dark so that public pressure is held at bay until the bill becomes law, and it’s too late. Tom Englehardt  at TomDispatch writes—America Last Will Trump Set a Record for the History Books? In its own inside-out, upside-down way, it’s almost wondrous to behold. As befits our president’s wildest dreams, it may even prove to be a record for the ages, one for the history books. He was, after all, the candidate who sensed it first.  When those he was running against, like the rest of Washington’s politicians, were still insisting that the United States remained at the top of its game, not an -- but the -- “indispensable nation,” the only truly “exceptional” one on the face of the Earth, he said nothing of the sort.  He campaigned on America’s decline, on this country’s increasing lack of exceptionality, its potential dispensability.  He ran on the single word “again” -- as in “make America great again” -- because (the implication was) it just isn’t anymore.  And he swore that he and he alone was the best shot Americans, or at least non-immigrant white Americans, had at ever seeing the best of days again. In that sense, he was our first declinist candidate for president and if that didn’t tell you something during the election season, it should have. No question about it, he hit a chord, rang a bell, because out in the heartland it was possible to sense a deepening reality that wasn’t evident in Washington.  The wealthiest country on the planet, the most militarily powerful in the history of... well, anybody, anywhere, anytime (or so we were repeatedly told)... couldn’t win a war, not even with the investment of trillions of taxpayer dollars, couldn’t do anything but spread chaos by force of arms. Meanwhile, at home, despite all that wealth, despite billionaires galore, including the one running for president, despite the transnational corporate heaven inhabited by Google and Facebook and Apple and the rest of the crew, parts of this country and its infrastructure were starting to feel distinctly (to use a word from another universe) Third Worldish.

The attack on members of Congress at baseball practice in Alexandria this morning is, by one count, the 195th mass shooting of the year. Thankfully, this time it appears that nobody was killed. The same can’t be said, alas, for the gun battle in a Fresno home on June 6, or the workplace eruption in Orlando on June 5, or the shooting in St. Louis on June 2. Mass-casualty gun violence, like all forms of violence, has declined from its terrible peaks of the early 1990s. Yet it remains prevalent in the United States on a scale that staggers the rest of the civilized world. Earlier this month, we grieved the terrible car and knife terrorist attack on London Bridge. In the United Kingdom, jihadis employ knives precisely because they cannot readily lay hands on guns. The consequence is that committed ideological murderers, operating in teams, inflict fewer fatalities on the rare occasions they strike than do American casual killers every few days. In only one of all the completed and attempted Islamic terrorist atrocities in the U.K. since 9/11 did the killers even carry a single gun: a 90-year-old Dutch revolver so battered that they never tried to use it. Yet despite the predictable recurrence of these crimes, Americans have developed a strong taboo against ever discussing or even thinking about them. When the killer strikes, it is “too soon.” The next day, it is “too late”; we have all moved onto the next topic. Then comes the next massacre, and it is “too soon” all over again. Like ancient villagers, Americans accept periodic plagues as a visitation from the gods, about which nothing can or should be done. The only permitted response is “thoughts and prayers”—certainly never rational action to reduce casualties in future. Even to open the discussion as to whether something might not be done violates the taboos of decency: How dare you politicize this completely unpredictable and uncontrollable event! It is as if gun violence were inscrutable to the mind of man, utterly beyond human control. The fact that such things do not happen anywhere else with anything approaching the same frequency—that too is the work of some ineffable mystery. Who can say why such things happen so seldom in Canada and Australia and Britain and Germany and France, and so often in the United States? Who would be rude enough even to wonder? A few hours before the attack on the Alexandria playing field, a lower-income housing tower erupted in flames in London. At least six people lost their lives; 20 more remain in critical condition at latest report. In an interview conducted even as firefighters battled the blaze, the mayor of London said, “There will be a great many questions over the coming days as to the cause of this tragedy and I want to reassure Londoners that we will get all the answers.” About fires, apparently, it is permitted to use human reason. But not about firearms! Against the much greater toll from those, the only remedy—the only approved response—is to send “thoughts and prayers.” Prayer refreshes the soul and clears the mind. It opens the way to repentance and improvement. But prayer alone does not lift from human beings the duty to do what they have the power to do. And that’s not my personal opinion. It’s also the opinion, emphatically declared, of the God to whom believers in the Bible address their prayers. In the stately words of the King James translation, Isaiah 1:15: And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.",2017-06-14 10:33:05,When Prayer Alone Does Not Suffice,"terrorism,crime and criminals",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/

On Thursday, it happened again: a mass shooting in America. This time, a gunman killed eight people at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Already, the shooting has led to demands for action. “10 Republican Senators — including Indiana’s @SenToddYoung & @SenatorBraun — decide whether we are going to do something about this deadly epidemic or continue to do nothing and live with this death every damn day.” the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted. But if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017, the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low. This has become an American routine: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues to experience levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens — no laws are passed by Congress; nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror. So why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it’s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States but also America’s unique relationship with guns — unlike that of any other developed country — and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times the rate of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to 2012 United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) To understand why that is, there’s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the 2018 Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. That does not, however, mean that every American adult actually owns guns. In fact, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population, as surveys from the Pew Research Center and the General Social Survey suggest. These three basic facts demonstrate America’s unique gun culture. There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence — a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal. And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world. At the same time, these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority, who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures. The research on this is overwhelmingly clear: No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths. This is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) within the United States, as this 2013 chart from Mother Jones demonstrates. And it’s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) across developed nations. Data compiled in 2018 from GunPolicy.org shows the United States is an extreme outlier in both categories. Opponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America’s unusual levels of gun violence — particularly mental illness. But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had a mental illness. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” Stone concluded. Other research has backed this up. Another argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns, enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting. Yet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths, but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths. While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others, the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents. Multiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process. This video, from ABC News, shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they’re shot: The relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates, meanwhile, is well established. Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center back this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths — not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This 2018 chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. To deal with its problem, America will have to not only make guns less accessible but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well. The research also speaks to this point: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. But even with the outrage over gun massacres, the sense that enough is enough, and the clear evidence that the problem is America’s high gun ownership rates, there hasn’t been significant legislation to help solve the problem. If you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures, they will often say that they support them. According to Pew Research Center surveys, most people in the US support universal background checks, a federal database to track gun sales, and bans on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun, another proposal with solid research behind it. So why don’t these measures ever get turned into law? That’s in part because they run into another political issue: Americans, increasingly in recent years, tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns. This is part of how gun control opponents are able to thwart even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures, such as background checks that include private sales (which have upwards of 80 percent support, according to Pew): They’re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns, and galvanize a backlash against it. This kind of problem isn’t unique to guns. For example, although many Americans say they don’t like the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law. The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a “government takeover of health care” and “death panels.” Since most Americans don’t have time to verify these claims, especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts, enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward. Of course, it’s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws. And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters — and they’re backed by a very powerful political lobby. The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association (NRA). The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America, and that development is more recent than you might think. The NRA was, for much of its early history, more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control, and even supported some gun restrictions. In 1934, NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying, “I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.” A 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything. As crime rose in the 1960s and ’70s, calls for more gun control grew as well. NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law — eventually ending, they feared, with the government’s seizure of all firearms in America. So members mobilized, installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership, forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today. This foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms. It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations, such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases, are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America, which the NRA views — wrongly, in the minds of some legal experts — as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. So anytime there’s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to quash these bills. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers. As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA’s support, especially the A-to-F ratings the organization gives out, very seriously. Politicians will go to sometimes absurd lengths to show their support for gun rights. In 2015, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with — this is not a joke — a machine gun. Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has. This might be changing. Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland, Florida, shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords, gun control groups are generally more organized, better funded, and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control. But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: very passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, “The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their ‘control’ position?” Probably not, Norquist suggested, “but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.” What’s behind that passion? Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, suggested that it’s a sense of tangible loss: Gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence — although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. (See: #NeverAgain.) There is also an exception at the state level, where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past several years, for instance, Vermont, Washington state, and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks. “There’s a lot more going on than Congress,” Goss said. “In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.” But state laws aren’t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name “the Iron Pipeline.” But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue — by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state. And until such a federal law is passed, there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law. Yet the NRA’s influence and its army of supporters push many of America’s legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures — even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them. In 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history. Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.) The result: Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers. It’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia’s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.” One 2010 study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking: Javier Zarracina/Vox One other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: “While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.” Depending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses, there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year. These events are, it goes without saying, devastating tragedies for the nation and, primarily, the victims and their families. Yet other, less covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings. Under a broad definition of mass shooting, these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016. That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year — most of which were suicides, not homicides. Preventing suicides isn’t something typically included in discussions of gun control, but other countries’ experiences show it can save lives. In Israel, where military service is mandatory for much of the population, policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend. So Israeli officials, as part of their solution, decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home. It worked: A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent. So while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control, the problem goes far beyond those incidents. Though it’s hard to fault them for trying; mass shootings, after all, force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture. But it seems that we as a nation just aren’t willing to look, or else don’t sufficiently mind what we see, when these events occur. Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut — in which a gunman killed 20 young children, six school personnel, and himself — catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states. Since then, there have been, by some estimates, thousands of mass shootings. And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

In the wake of mass shootings, many people wonder how they could have been prevented. Were there warning signs that should have been heeded? Was the person mentally ill? Did they hold extremist views? It’s a question we’re bound to ask after awful attacks like the deadly shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio over the weekend. President Donald Trump’s response, in part, was to blame the deaths on mental health. “Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,” Trump said on the Monday. It wasn’t the first time Trump blamed mental health, and dismissed guns as a problem. After the school shooting in Parkland, Florida in 2018 he called for increased focus on mental health care to potentially prevent similar attacks. The truth is: It’s largely a myth that poor mental health is associated with mass violence. “The share of America’s violence problem (excluding suicide) that is explainable by diseases like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is tiny,” Vox’s Dylan Matthews writes. What’s more, there are serious mental health care shortages in America, and Trump and his Republican allies tried to push legislation for much of his early presidency that would have potentially limited it even further. The only personal factors that reliably correlate with mass shooters are being young and being male. There are a lot of angsty young men in this country. That makes prediction hard. But what makes prediction even harder is just how rare these instances of mass shooting are. Yes, America has a serious gun violence problem. But the vast majority of people will never commit such a crime. Even if we said one in a million people will become mass murderers, that would be too high an estimate. There are 323 million people in the United States. The fact that there are so few mass shooters and so many more harmless people makes it actually mathematically impossible to predict who might become a mass shooter. On Monday, Trump said he’s “directing the department of justice to work in partnership with local, state and federal agencies, as well as social media companies to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike.” But this is likely to be an exercise in futility. few years ago, Sanjay Srivastava, a psychologist at the University of Oregon, walked us through a thought experiment to consider. ”Even with very good detection procedures, when you’re talking about rare events, [prediction models] do not work the way you might think,” he said. Even a prediction model that’s 99 percent accurate would be of no use. Let’s see why. This is science fiction, clearly. But if we could invent such a machine, we’d want it to analyze the intricate regions of a person’s brain and then determine his intent and willingness to commit a mass crime. In addition to mind reading, we’d want it to track a person’s online behavior, social connections, and purchasing decisions and use that data to determine who is a would-be mass killer. For the purposes of this example, let’s assume it works absurdly well. This 99 percent accuracy is also science fiction. We’re not even that good at predicting the weather, let alone the complexities of human behavior. But you’d have faith in a system that was 99 percent accurate, wouldn’t you? It would mean that it would correctly identify mass shooters 99 percent of the time and correctly identify peaceful citizens 99 percent of the time. Let’s assume that there’s actually one future mass shooter lurking in this group of 100,000 people. The machine is 99 percent accurate, so it labels 99 percent of these “harmless” people correctly. Hooray! More good news: The machine should also theoretically correctly identify the mass shooter. What? I thought this thing was 99 percent accurate! What junk! Well, it is 99 percent accurate. But that means it will falsely label one out of every 100 people a mass shooter. In a group of 100,000 people, we’d be left with 1,001 potential mass shooters: 1,000 false positives and one correct guess. What does the government do with this information? Monitor all 3.2 million potential killers? Wiretap all their homes? This isn’t feasible. In the wake of the horrendous shooting in Norway in 2011 that left more than 70 people dead, the Swedish Defense Research Agency looked into whether it would be possible to monitor social media to identify would-be mass shooters. Here’s what the agency wrote in a 2014 paper: To produce fully automatic computer tools for detecting lone wolf terrorists on the Internet is, in our view, not possible, both due to the enormous amounts of data (which is only partly indexed by search engines) and due to the deep knowledge that is needed to really understand what is discussed or expressed in written text or other kinds of data available on the Internet, such as videos or images. The lesson here is that it’s much easier to look backward and assume the warning signs were there and could have been spotted. ”But that’s going the wrong way — it’s hindsight, not prediction,” Srivastava said. ”Spend some time online and realize just how many young men there are saying angry things on the internet. Which ones are really dangerous, and which ones are just exercising their constitutional right to say angry things? The math just isn’t on your side.” Prediction won’t work, so what will? Well, there’s an answer, but it’s not going to make a lot of people happy. Considering the mathematical hurdles of predicting killers, maybe stricter gun control is actually the easier option to reduce gun violence. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Five people, including the gunman, are dead after a workplace shooting in suburban Orlando, Florida. The story is quickly developing, so some details may be wrong and may change. But here’s a rundown of what we know, based on the best information available so far: The shooting is a devastating tragedy, but also the kind of event that Americans have become increasingly familiar with over the past several years — including another shooting in Orlando at a gay nightclub in 2016. And as the country deals with a level of gun violence unmatched by other developed nations, the question has often turned to what restrictions on firearms could help reduce how many shootings happen year after year. No other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times Sweden’s, and nearly 16 times Germany’s, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Javier Zarracina/Vox What’s more, there appears to be a correlation between America’s high levels of gun violence and gun ownership, as this chart from Tewksbury Lab shows: Tewksbury Lab Research reviews by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center have concluded that more gun ownership leads to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances. Studies have found this at both the state and country level. Take, for instance, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, showing the correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates: A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level. This holds up around the world. As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” Guns are not the only factor that contributes to violence. (Other factors include, for example, concentrations of poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership and easy access to guns are major reasons the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. And stricter gun policies could help. The research shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help address the toll of gun violence: Studies in both Connecticut and Missouri suggested that gun licensing laws in those states helped reduce homicides and suicides. But as Harvard’s David Hemenway told Dylan Matthews for Vox, it would likely take decades for the mild gun control measures proposed in the US to have a significant impact. “It’s all speculation,” Hemenway said. “I suspect it would take a while (decades) for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a) we have so many guns which are durable, and b) we have a gun culture — we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countries.” To have a more immediate impact, then, the US would have to find a way to quickly remove the number of guns in circulation. Other countries have actually done that: In Australia, after a 1996 mass shooting, lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program that essentially confiscated people’s guns, seizing at least 650,000 firearms. Related According to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers, Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent. Although it’s hard to gauge how much of this was driven by the buyback program, researchers argue it likely played some role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.” Still, similar policies would be difficult to pass in America, a nation in which gun culture and ownership are tremendously ingrained — notably in the Second Amendment. And gun owners are backed by a powerful lobby: the National Rifle Association. Combined, these forces have stopped any serious gun legislation from passing at the federal level — although some states have passed new restrictions in the past few years. The result is, based on the evidence, more shootings — including, perhaps, more tragedies like the one unfolding in Orlando. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

America’s murder rate climbed for the second year in a row in 2016 — and the reason for the surge is still unclear. A new report from the Brennan Center for Justice analyzed crime rates from the 30 largest US cities. Brennan concluded that although the overall crime rate increased by about 0.9 percent in these cities, the homicide rate rose by a whopping 13.1 percent. More than half of the increase is explained by a continued rise in murders in Chicago, the nation’s third largest city. (One caveat: A few cities were left out in some of the estimates due to a lack of available data.) This would make 2016 the second year in a row when the murder rate rose in the 30 largest US cities. In 2015, more than half the increase was attributable to Baltimore, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Brennan estimated that the violent crime rate in the 30 largest US cities also increased by 4.2 percent, in large part due to spikes in violent crime in Baltimore and Chicago. The increases come after decades of drops in the crime and murder rates. A previous report from Brennan, which used preliminary data from before the new analysis, found that the overall murder rate across the entire US rose by 7.8 percent between 2015 and 2016. At that estimate, the murder rate would still be at nearly half of what it was 25 years before — but it’s a sizable increase nonetheless. Brennan’s reports are based on early estimates. The FBI will release full 2016 crime data for the whole US later this year. But Brennan’s reports give us an early peek at what’s likely to come. Throughout these reports, Brennan has repeatedly emphasized that even after the increase, America is still much safer than it was just decades ago. The murder rate increases in 30 large US cities and nationwide also don’t mean that every big city in the US saw a rise; New York City, for example, has seen crime drop or hold steady for years. “Today, the crime rate in New York is actually lower than the national crime rate,” Brennan previously noted. But after the second year in a row of national increases, the report raises a red flag about what is happening in the US. Could crime be back on the rise? Or are the 2015 and 2016 numbers, like similar increases in 2005 and 2006, just another temporary rise before the crime and murder rates continue their long-term decline? And what could be behind the recent increases? Criminologists caution that it’s probably still too early to know why violent crime and murder have been going up in the past couple of years, but they have some early ideas. One prominent theory is what’s known as the “Ferguson effect”: the impact of Black Lives Matter protests against police shootings since Michael Brown’s 2014 death in Ferguson, Missouri. There are essentially two hypothesized versions of the Ferguson effect: One is that Black Lives Matter protests have scared law enforcement officers from doing the proactive policing necessary to prevent crime, while at the same time criminals have been emboldened because they now know police are backing off from aggressive tactics. The other theory is that these protests have reinforced communities’ distrust of law enforcement, making it harder to solve and prevent crimes. It’s also possible both of these versions are playing a mixed role. Conservative columnist Heather Mac Donald has been a major proponent of the first version of this theory. She’s pointed to data showing that after protests and riots over the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore in 2015, murder rates began to climb. And there was some evidence in her favor in the data for last year, with violent crime and murder rates in Chicago rising after protests over the police shooting of Laquan McDonald. (But we’ll need a more rigorous analysis before this connection is validated.) Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri St. Louis who studied the 2015 increase in murders, has cautiously argued that the other version of the Ferguson effect is more plausible. He previously told me, “There is good sociological and historical evidence that if people lose confidence in the police to protect them, or if they lack trust in the police because they believe the police are harassing them or behaving unfairly, they do tend to take matters into their own hands. So one tends to see preemptive killings and retaliatory shootings go up.” The distinction matters for policy. If Mac Donald’s version of the Ferguson effect is right, it vindicates proactive, aggressive policing tactics that have characterized the US’s “tough on crime” policy era. If the other version is right, it calls for less aggressive tactics and more community engagement. Still, there’s reason for caution: No rigorous study so far has definitively backed up either version of the Ferguson effect. And its impact may not last long: For example, Brennan projected that Baltimore’s murder rate declined in 2016 after a massive nearly 56 percent increase in 2015. Another possibility, echoed by every criminologist I’ve talked to about this, is that the 2015 and 2016 changes are short-term fluctuations that won’t become a long-term trend. We’ve seen short-term fluctuations before. The murder rate went up steadily from 5.5 per 100,000 people in 2004 to 5.6 in 2005 and 5.8 in 2006 — before dropping all the way down to the historical low of 4.4 in 2014. The same thing could have happened in 2015 and 2016. For whatever reason (maybe even some version of the Ferguson effect), the two years were just particularly bad for murders and crime. But maybe (hopefully) it was just a blip, and the long-term trend of crime decline will continue. It’s also possible that the murder rate alone gives a distorted view of violent crime. Since the murder rate is generally very low, it’s prone to large statistical fluctuations. As one example, New Orleans–based crime analyst Jeff Asher told me he expects the 2016 mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 50 died, to lead to a massive increase in the murder rate in the city, even though it was just one particularly bad event. Consider this: Criminologists are still debating what caused the roughly 50 percent decrease in violent crime and murders since the 1980s and ’90s. There are many theories, from changes in policing tactics to more incarceration to reductions in lead exposure. But no one knows for certain. Similarly, experts are beginning to develop all sorts of theories for why there may be an ongoing rise in murder and violent crime rates. Asher, for one, told me it’s possible police are beginning to pull back on tactics and strategies that worked to reduce crime before, perhaps as a result of dwindling resources. University of Chicago criminal justice researcher John Roman argued that the increase in murders may be driven by shooters using higher-caliber weapons — a claim backed by recent reports — while a rise in shootings in Chicago could be driven by a contagion of shootings leading to retaliatory shootings. But again, all of this needs more study as researchers work through hyper-local trends to tease out a plausible national story. In fact, it’s possible the ultimate cause is a factor we haven’t even considered yet. Or there may not be a single national driver for the increases at all; instead, the increases may be driven by disparate local issues that vary from city to city. Statistical fluctuations and “we don’t really know yet” aren’t the most satisfying answers. But given that they’re seriously plausible, everyone should probably wait a few years before trying to build a definitive theory around one or two years of bad crime statistics.

Nearly one year ago, a man walked into a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and killed 49 people — the worst mass shooting in US history. The brutal attack took place during Pride Month, when LGBTQ communities come together in solidarity to celebrate and show the world that it’s okay to be queer. This year, the Pulse shooting hangs in the thoughts of all Pride celebrations. It’s a now-jarring fact of American history that the worst mass shooting ever targeted LGBTQ people. It has made this Pride Month all the more important — a chance to reflect on what that horrifying shooting nearly a year ago means for the movement. Yet over at the White House, as far as the Trump administration is concerned, June isn’t Pride Month (although it is National Homeowners Month). Even as events last year showed how necessary Pride still is, the Trump administration has eschewed a tradition started by President Bill Clinton and upheld by President Barack Obama (although not President George W. Bush), and has failed to proclaim June as Pride Month. This lack of action comes despite Trump’s promises on the campaign trail that he will protect “L, G, B, T … Q” people, even posing with the rainbow flag to signal that he’s a different kind of Republican on these issues. Many people in LGBTQ communities were skeptical of his promises, but they were commitments that Trump made. By forgoing something as simple as declaring June as Pride Month, Trump has shown how unserious he was about his promises. Orlando demonstrated to the movement and others why celebrating Pride each year was still necessary: Despite all the legal and cultural progress in the past few years, someone still felt emboldened enough to launch a horrific attack in an LGBTQ space. By failing to recognize Pride Month even as the anniversary of such an attack approaches, Trump has offered yet another reminder about the progress left to be made. Even without presidential proclamations, June has been Pride Month since the 1970s, marking the anniversary of the landmark Stonewall Rebellion in New York City. Through the late 1960s, police regularly raided gay establishments in cities across the country, since innocuous acts like same-sex dancing were sometimes punishable by law. But at Stonewall in June 1969, patrons fought back against the police for several days in an act that has largely become known as the beginning of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The movement and Pride Month have continued since then, chipping away at the inequality that LGBTQ people face in the US and across the world. To get a sense of why Pride Month is still necessary, consider: If the Orlando shooting happened just a few hundred miles north in Alabama or Georgia, it would likely not have been recognized as a hate crime under state law. It’d be recognized as a hate crime under federal law, but states maintain different laws to direct their own law enforcement agencies, which make up the great majority of US police forces. That’s because many states in the US still don’t protect LGBTQ people under their own hate crime laws. And while the federal government was bound to step in for a shooting as destructive as Orlando’s, other hate crimes go uninvestigated and unprosecuted, since the feds don’t have the resources to go after all anti-LGBTQ hate crimes. (Hate crimes are so poorly tracked by government agencies, in fact, that we don’t even know how many hate crimes there are each year.) We see this kind of patchwork at the state level with other laws relevant to LGBTQ people. For example, the federal government and most state laws explicitly prohibit discrimination in the workplace, housing, public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and other places that serve the public), and schools based on race, sex (except public accommodations at the federal level), and other protected groups. But sexual orientation and gender identity aren’t explicitly included in these federal or state laws. So in most states, it’s legal under local and state law to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace, housing, public accommodations, and schools. So under most states’ laws, an employer can legally fire someone because he’s gay, a landlord can legally evict someone because she’s lesbian, and a hotel manager can legally deny service to someone who’s transgender — for no reason other than the person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. There are also the unique challenges LGBTQ people face in the criminal justice system, LGBTQ youth homelessness, health issues like HIV/AIDS, and the extreme threat of deportation for undocumented immigrants fleeing anti-LGBTQ persecution. These are the kinds of issues that exemplify why Pride Month is still necessary. Yes, the LGBTQ rights movement had a massive victory with marriage equality. But the reality is there’s still a lot of progress to be made before LGBTQ people have fully equal protection under the law. The Trump administration has shown how fragile LGBTQ rights gains really are. The administration is largely made up of politicians who have been staunchly anti-LGBTQ for their whole public careers, like Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. And what the administration has done so far has signaled that it would rather pull the country in a direction less friendly to LGBTQ rights. For example, last year the Obama administration signed a guidance that asked publicly funded K-12 schools to respect and protect transgender students’ rights, including their ability to use the bathroom and locker room that align with their gender identity. This was at the time taken as a massive victory in the LGBTQ movement. The Trump administration, however, quickly rescinded the guidance once in office — leaving trans students effectively unprotected by the federal government. In doing so, the Trump administration played into the bathroom myth that has been increasingly used to subjugate trans rights across the US. The argument, in short, is that if trans people are allowed to use the bathroom for their gender identity, either trans women or men who pose as trans women will sexually assault or harass women in bathrooms. There is zero evidence for this, as I have repeatedly explained. But the myth has been used to bar trans people from using the bathroom for their gender identity, with several states passing laws or considering bills to that effect. Gavin Grimm, a trans teenager who’s sued his school for access to the right bathroom, best captured why these anti-trans policies are a big problem: “This wasn’t just about bathrooms. It was about the right to exist in public spaces for trans people,” he told me, quoting trans actress Laverne Cox. “Without the access to appropriate bathrooms, there’s so much that you’re limited in doing. If you try to imagine what your day would be like if you had absolutely no restrooms to use other than the home, it would take planning. You would probably find yourself avoiding liquids, probably avoiding eating, maybe [avoiding] going out in public for too long at a time.” This is what Trump is now letting schools do to trans kids. And several schools have embraced anti-trans policies as a result — that’s one reason why there are now several lawsuits working through state and federal courts in regards to this issue. The impact Trump will have on LGBTQ rights can only grow from here. Will he appoint a Supreme Court justice who won’t uphold LGBTQ rights? Will he encourage Congress to pass religious freedom measures that effectively allow discrimination against LGBTQ people? Will other actions he takes, such as an increase in deportations, disproportionately hurt LGBTQ people — by, for example, sending immigrants back to countries where they are prosecuted for their identities? So it’s not just Trump’s failure to proclaim June as Pride Month. It’s also everything else that’s come with it. The anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting and worst attack on LGBTQ Americans in US history will come and go. But Trump’s retreat from his promise to be an ally is yet another standing reminder for LGBTQ communities about how fragile many of their newly attained rights are — and that nothing can be taken for granted.

What’s going on? The scene was all too familiar. A group of innocent people targeted, a lone man with a gun, a violent outburst. During a Sunday morning service at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on a group of church-goers, killing 26 people and wounding 20 others. Related One characteristic in particular links Kelley to a long line of mass shooters before him: a history of domestic violence. In 2012, Kelley was discharged from the Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico for assaulting his wife and child, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. Kelley fits a pattern. In June, James T. Hodgkinson fired 50 rounds of shots from a military rifle and handgun at a group of GOP leaders at a congressional practice session in Alexandria, Virginia. He had been arrested in 2006 for domestic battery and discharge of a weapon after reportedly punching his daughter’s friend and shooting at her boyfriend. The charges were dropped, but he later lost custody of his daughter. Omar Mateen, the Pulse nightclub shooter, allegedly beat his wife. Robert Lewis Dear, who shot up a Planned Parenthood in 2015, was accused of physical abuse by two ex-wives. According to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, a majority of mass shooting victims from 2009 to 2015 were an intimate partner, ex-partner, or other family member of the shooter. And research from Boston University shows that in states with more gun owners, there are more homicides — and women are more likely to be the ones killed. To understand the link between mass shootings and domestic violence, I spoke with Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York Cortland and the author of several books on gun policy, including The Politics of Gun Control. Spitzer is a frequent commentator on issues related to gun control and mass shootings. This conversation is edited and condensed for clarity. You have written a lot on the history of the [National Rifle Association] and the politics of gun control. How does domestic violence — specifically, violence against women — play into this history? It's interesting to look at the connection between what's generally labeled gun culture and male/female attitudes. Sociologists and writers go to gun shows and talk to people there about their interest in guns, their affinity to guns. And oftentimes, the people being interviewed say, ""Please don't use my name because I'm divorced from my wife and she thinks I'm hiding income,"" or they raise very specific issues about marital troubles or male/female troubles and express resentment over the idea that the estranged spouse might try to get more financial support, which seems to be a rather odd sort of thing. Joan Burbick, who wrote Gun Show Nation, saw that marital problems very much came to the fore in her interviews with men at gun shows, and this was going back 10 years. It's not just a proclivity to violence, but it's closely related to traditional notions of male behavior — and by that, I mean macho behavior. One of the arguments about gun ownership is that men, to some degree, are expressing a hypermasculinity, and that is very much married to what you might call traditional attitudes about marriage, about male/female relations. Which include subjugation of the woman, a woman's place is in the home, that sort of thing. Of course, in the modern era, those attitudes rarely prevail. There aren't that many women who would meekly accept this idea that the woman should stay in the home, should not argue with the man — this whole bundle of old attitudes. In the gun culture, there is also an extolling of what might be identified as traditional male values of male dominance, of the man properly expressing the use of force. As women have gained more rights, have mass shootings or domestic violence incidents increased? Boy, that's a very good question and I don't think anybody has marshaled real evidence to support that proposition. Anecdotally, and even in recent news articles, evidence suggests that men go after the women in their lives because the women argued with them, disagreed with them. Perhaps argued as to whether they should be owning guns at all, things like that. It's often the woman who calls the police, who says, ”My husband or my boyfriend is threatening me, and he owns guns and he's threatened me with a gun.” Are you seeing parallels between the motivations of a mass shooter and the motivations of somebody who's committing domestic violence? Well, domestic violence incidents often become mass shooting incidents. That's a key — the political events receive more attention. The Orlando shooting, the ballpark shooting last week, because of the political overtones. The more, I hate to say, ""routine shootings,"" but the more numerous shootings that spiral out of control often begin with a domestic dispute. A man shoots his estranged wife and three children and then kills himself. I mean, those kinds of things happen a lot, and constitute a significant proportion of the total of mass shootings. Is a history of domestic violence the greatest common characteristic among mass shooters, beyond political motivations or other variables? Statistically, yes. They simply don't receive the same degree of attention. When you look at the 11,000 or 12,000 murders last year, what proportion of them involved people who knew each other? In a majority of murders, the perpetrator and the victim knew each other. They were relatives, neighbors, friends. Within the subset of the perpetrator knowing the victim, how many of them were domestic-related? I'll hazard a guess that the majority of them are. [Author’s note: Spitzer is correct: according to Angela Stroud, author of Good Guys With Guns, ""between 1980 and 2008, 41.5 percent of murdered women were killed by a current or former husband or boyfriend, 30 percent were killed by an acquaintance, and 16.7 percent were killed by a family member.""] Tying personal relationships not only to mass shooting but to murder generally, and to interpersonal violence, it plays a huge role. What is the relationship between gun laws and gun ownership? Those two things themselves are correlated. So a state like Alaska or Montana has very high gun ownership rate on a per capita basis. Also extremely lax gun laws. And you indeed find very high homicide rates, and especially very high gun suicide rates. That's the other part of this. The correlation between the prevalence of guns and gun suicide is very significant. Strictness of gun laws is related to that, as well. So obviously there's an interaction effect there, too. If you're a state that has strict gun laws on the books, it's an indication that the gun lobby or gun rights people in that state are not as strong, which also correlates to less gun ownership to begin with. And when you have stricter laws, you can assume it has a discouraging effect on gun ownership. You have to do more things to get your permit, for example. I went through the process of getting a pistol permit here in New York a couple years ago. It's a lengthy, complicated process. It's not like the 12 states that have now eliminated pistol permitting entirely. If you can legally own a handgun, you don't need a permit, because the state doesn't issue them. So, a lot easier to carry a gun around with you, to own guns. Those things are all correlated, and I don't know that anybody has done the statistical analysis to separate out what impact each factor has — the law, gun ownership rates, crime rates. But there definitely is a correlation. States with a higher rate of gun ownership also have more homicides. Not only that — women are disproportionately affected. Research shows that gun ownership rates cause only 1.5 percent of the rise in murders of men but 41 percent of the rise in murders of women. Why are women more likely to be victims of gun violence? One, when you find greater levels of violence generally, a lot of that's going to be domestic violence or spawned by domestic violence. So you would expect that. The other thing is this notion of traditional male attitudes — that the man rules the roost, that the male ego in a relationship should be handled carefully. There is certainly reason to believe that more traditional attitudes about male/female relationships, which make a greater allowance for men's expression of violence and masculinity, which are often seen as linked, can cultivate violence against women and violence generally. What about the argument that if women have access to guns, they can protect themselves from a violent male partner? Well, the NRA has been playing on that argument for many years. There are women who own guns, obviously, and some for that reason. If you look at the percentage of gun owners who are women across the last 20 years, what you find is that it's basically been level. There have been short-term increases and decreases, but basically, the gun people have failed to persuade more women to get guns. To buy guns, own guns, use guns. There is an intuitive logic, frankly, to the idea that if any segment of society should be getting guns to protect themselves, it probably should be women, because women, on average, are smaller and not as strong physically as the average man. But when you look at what actually happens, the gun violence that ensues is far more likely to be used against women than in protection of women. Even in cases where the women have training, where they are acquainted with the use of guns. There are cases, obviously, of women who have successfully protected themselves. But there's not a lot of real, hard evidence to support the idea that women are materially benefited by getting a gun to protect themselves. Many men who have been charged with domestic violence are still able to purchase or keep a gun. Why is that? Including, of course, the shooter from last week, who falls into that category. Exactly. One reason is that in a final legal judgment, the ultimate verdict may be appealed. It may be bargained down, so that it's a sufficiently minor offense that they're not barred from getting guns. Secondly, we know that in domestic disputes, the spouse will ultimately decide to drop charges or will not file charges, even though real violence may have occurred. So you have a prosecution problem, where the complainant doesn't want to proceed with the complaint and ergo, no police record. And the general tendency, historically, at least, for police to not treat domestic violence episodes as seriously as other kinds of violence. Police forces have come a long way in that regard, but they've not come far enough to help out a lot of women who have been subject to this kind of violence. If you don't have that legal trial for a felony, or serious something on the record, like threatening to kill your wife, these individuals often wind up being able to get guns. Many cases of domestic abuse or violence go unreported. Does that make it even harder to establish this relationship between domestic violence and mass shootings? Well, sure it does, precisely because you don't have the hard data. You can count, with great accuracy, the number of murders that occur every year, because when a murder occurs, the police are there. They conduct an investigation and reports are filed, etc. But if no report is filed or if charges are dismissed or withdrawn later on, without a hard paper trail, it's much, much harder to have good evidence about the frequency of these circumstances and therefore, the links to people who commit other kinds of gun violence later. So it is a problem because of underreporting. What about mass shooters? Is there a large enough sample size to draw conclusions? That's an issue too. First, there's some dispute about what constitutes a mass shooting. How the FBI counts them versus news organizations, things like that. In recent years we've had something like 300 mass shootings. It correlates closely to the number of days in the calendar year. It's on the small end, relatively speaking, so there's a limit to what you can do with the data from those cases. When you have 10,000 murders a year nationwide, versus, let's say 300 mass murders, given that the mass murders are normally committed by a single individual, that's 300 individuals out of a nation of 325 million people who do something horrendous. So there is a question of being cautious about generalizing about such a tiny number in relation to all crimes, or in relation to the population as a whole. Do women commit mass shootings? What could we learn from those outliers? There was the case in San Bernardino. The husband and wife. So she participated with her husband, but she clearly was an active participant. But there are very, very few. Which is consistent with the notion that most, the vast majority of most violent crime generally, is committed by men. So it really is the province primarily of men, and younger men. Although ... the ballpark shooter last week was 66. Women just don't commit as many violent crimes. After either a mass shooting or a domestic violence incident, are there clues that would have given hints about what happened? Are the clues the same for both mass shootings and domestic violence incidents? There are definitely clues. Here in New York state, if you apply for a pistol permit, one of the things you need to do is give the county sheriff a list, in the application, of four character references. And the police contact those people, and they send them detailed questionnaires, with the most detailed kinds of questions. ""Does this person abuse substances, alcohol or other drugs?"" ""Does the person exhibit any behavior such that you don't think they should be able to own a gun?"" And so on. In other words, they're not using the standard, ""Did this person break the law?"" but, ""Is there anything about this person that gives you a whiff, a scent, that maybe they shouldn't have a gun?"" And if you look at a lot of the mass shooters, they gave off abundant signals to their family, to fellow students, to acquaintances, to co-workers. If anybody had asked those people, ""Look, is there anything about this person that says to you maybe this person ought not to have a gun?"" they would have all said, ""Yes, absolutely.” It was true of [Seung-Hui] Cho, who shot up Virginia Tech; it was true of the guy who shot Gabby Giffords; it was true of the guy who shot up the movie theater in Colorado in 2012. Had any of those people lived in New York and tried to get a gun legally, there's no way they would have been given legal permission to get a gun. Contrary to what many people say, the law does make a difference. It is the job of the law to make it tough or impossible for a person who shouldn't have a gun to get a gun. But most states don't do that. There are usually signals of mental health, of rising rage, uncontrollable rage and other things, but in most places, nobody makes that connection. In most states, they're not asking questions of friends, neighbors, co-workers about whether the person should be a gun owner. And so are there signs? There absolutely are. And could they stop mass shootings? I don't think there's any doubt that they could — at least some of them. After every lethal shooting, there's usually a conversation in Congress about enacting tougher laws, but they often fail to pass. What would it really take for this country to enact tougher national gun laws? We are in a situation where the NRA is thoroughly embedded in the Republican Party. The Republican Party is more conservative than it has been probably ever in its history, and is ever more loyal to kind of archconservative principles, including untrammeled access to guns. So it's not really possible to have a national debate when the leaders of the two elected branches of government don't want to talk about these things at all. Because leaders have an ability to shift the focus of debate. So we would need to have a very different government in place. One where these issues could at least be discussed. And that's not going to happen in the near future. I would add that at the state level, there's been a lot happening. And a fair number of states have enacted tougher laws in the last three years or so, three or four years. But more states have enacted laws to weaken their existing gun laws, so there's been a lot happening in the states. Part of this puzzle is that the gun safety side, or gun control side, needs to continue the things it's been doing: raising more money, spending more money, making it a campaign issue, and building grassroots support to try and counterbalance the longtime dominance of the NRA. That could change things too. But these are long-term trends. Related Are there other variables that incite someone to lash out in a violent way? Political reasons? The 2017 shooting in Virginia was the 153rd mass shooting in just 165 days under Trump, which is outpacing recent rates. Well, it's kind of a big gray area. There are many factors that contribute to that. One of the arguments about the Trump era is that Trump's open invocation to violence, exhorting people who came to his rallies to beat up protesters, things like that — some of the rhetoric that he borrowed from the alt-right, even some anti-Semitic rhetoric; he denied it, but you know there are pretty clear links — that that has kind of given a green light to dark forces in the country. I don't know if it has actually translated into more violence, or if there's other factors at play. But it's at least a question to be raised. Because the tenor and tone of national debate, and of course after the shooting last week, people saying, and members of both parties saying we need to lower the partisan tone, and things like that. The tone of politics does have an effect, although it's hard to show a link between politicians arguing with each other and some guy in his garage deciding to pull out his gun and go shoot people. Although, obviously, with the shooter last week, there did indeed seem to be that kind of link. What else, besides enacting tougher gun laws, could also help protect women who are victims of violence? First, it goes back to policing procedures. How police handle such complaints when they first receive them. If the police don't get a complaint, they don't know, they can't do anything. And if you're a subject of domestic violence, where else are you gonna go? Obviously, family or friends, but in terms of it being a public matter. So that's a factor. In addition, more thorough background checks could well be valuable as a way of getting a better handle on some of these sorts of problems. The nation is not going to be getting rid of its guns. We have a great many of them. But given that, there are more things that could be done for society to try and make sure that guns, especially the destructive varieties, don't fall into the wrong hands. You're not going to get everybody — by a long shot. But you would rather have a mass shooter using a bolt-action rifle than an assault rifle with a 30- or 70-bullet magazine, or magazine drum. I mean, that's not hard to figure out. You are a member of the NRA. Yes. Does the NRA bear any responsibility for some of the mass shootings or any of these violent acts? Well, I am a member of the NRA, and I've been a member for over 20 years, and I'm also a member of the Brady Coalition. In terms of bearing responsibility, I would say that any group that exhorts people to get guns, and to lobby on their behalf, does have a responsibility to talk not just about gun rights but about gun safety, about the responsibility that comes along with having a gun. Where are the public service announcements on television and radio to exhort gun owners to be sure and lock up your gun? To keep the ammunition, especially if you have children in the house, stored separately? To remember that a gun is a lethal weapon, treat it with respect, make sure you know what you're doing? To say to people, ""You guys, you have to be careful if you own a gun""? So yes, I think they do have a responsibility, and I don't think they do a very good job of fulfilling it, because to them it sounds like an apology. And they just don't want to do that. How can you be both a member of the NRA and the Brady Campaign? Well, I study the issue. It's a way for me to see what the organizations are doing. I also do it because it freaks out my students. They don't get it, or they look at me like, ""Huh?"" For that reason alone, it's well worthwhile.

Sixteen people accidentally shot themselves, eleven people were killed in gun accidents, nine kids were accidentally shot, six people accidentally fired guns they claimed they were cleaning or otherwise “inspecting,” four people were accidentally shot during their target practice (one more just couldn’t wait to get to the range, and was accidentally shot in the car on the way there), four people accidentally fired their weapons into neighboring properties (plus one more incident in which a passerby in golf cart was struck by a stray round), three people accidentally shot family members or significant others, and two people accidentally fired their weapons while shopping at neighborhood Walmart stores. OK, that last item was a bit unusual. (But only a little bit.) We’ll get back to that in a moment. But first, some of the other, more unusual incidents of the week. First, a relatively well-publicized and tragic event from Forest Park, GA, in which a 13-year-old boy accidentally shot and killed himself while streaming his gunplay on Instagram Live. Second, an equally tragic incident from Fort Worth, TX—one which we’ve unfortunately seen more than a few times—in which a man shot and killed himself “while showing a friend how the safety on his gun worked.” I shouldn’t have to tell anyone that there are a million better ways to demonstrate how a gun’s safety works than by pointing it at your own or someone else’s head and pulling the trigger. Even pointing it at your own foot and pulling the trigger is better, though I would likewise counsel against it. But if you absolutely must demonstrate how a safety works, first, make sure you actually know how it works, and second, give yourself some margin for error if your demonstration really has to include pulling the trigger. Do your best to be sure the gun is pointed in a “safe” direction. One further reminder: if you’re in an apartment building, the units next door, or above and below you, do not count as “safe” directions. (See this week’s incident from Montebello, CA for further illustration of that point.) One more safety tip, while we’re at it. Whether you’re an expert or a beginner taking classes to earn your concealed carry permit (in states where such training is even required), if you absolutely must spend additional time “practicing aiming [your] gun and pulling the trigger” but don’t have time to go all the way to the gun range to do it, one really great idea is to spend a moment making sure your weapon is not loaded. Also, if you’re going to practice both aiming and pulling the trigger, do not “aim” at your own leg. I do not know whether the person involved in this accident did, in fact, go on to earn her concealed carry permit. But I do know that it happened in Florida, so, you know, probably. A few more final comments. One, just as a reminder of how convoluted stories that end in a GunFAIL can be, try making sense of the events of April 11th in Russellville, AR. None of what happened there makes much sense to me, except that the risk posed by adding a gun to that fact pattern seems extraordinary. That much seems obvious, even though I can’t make heads or tails out of the rest of it. Next, the two accidental discharges inside Walmart stores illustrate some continuing problems with wider acceptance of citizens going about armed in daily life. The Conroe, TX incident illustrates how a moment of carelessness (or perhaps an entire gun-carrying life of carelessness that just happens to crystallize on one moment) can quickly spin way out of control. Luckily, not all the things that could have gone wrong in Conroe did go wrong. But someone made a very poor choice of carrying methods there, and dropped their weapon, leading to an accidental discharge inside the store. No one was hit, but at least one other shopper said of the incident, ""It really freaked me out. For a second, I thought it was another mass shooting."" I imagine that could cause some real problems in a place where a significant number of citizens are armed, and then suddenly become panicked and confused, then are perhaps further surprised to see several other armed strangers roaming the store with guns in hand. The second Walmart incident, in Sidney, OH, likewise leaves us with questions. It’s not entirely clear from reports whether this particular store location prohibits firearms on the premises, but most reports do make note of state’s new law, which “overrules private business owners from banning guns on their property as long as the person is a CCW license holder and locks the weapon in his or her personal vehicle.” That would be much more relevant if guns were prohibited in the store, and this gun owner brought his in, regardless. But it’s just not clear. Still, we can be pretty sure that discharging the weapon was a problem, since Sidney police confiscated it afterwards. Yet another gun carried for “safety” that instead ended up endangering everyone nearby. Lastly, there’s this week’s title story, from Crawford County, KS. I don’t think it needs any explaining, other than to point out that though hunters and others are fairly often mistaken for game and shot, this is a particular danger in turkey hunting. Apparently, turkey hunters don’t wear blaze orange gear, and further, they appear from the reports to do more to disguise themselves as turkeys to lure game than the hunters of other species do. I think the results are somewhat predictable, but you may disagree. I’ve never heard of anyone accidentally shot while buying one of the turkeys widely available in stores, but I suppose both that some people like a challenge, and perhaps we just haven’t waited long enough, yet.

Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) told talk show host Matt Murphy that Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and at least four other people were hit by gunfire on Wednesday morning while practicing at a field in the Del Rey neighborhood in Alexandria, Virginia. Scalise was shot in the hip and is in stable condition. In addition to Scalise, CNN confirms that two Capitol Hill police officers were also shot. Alexandria police say that they have apprehended the suspect and that he is no longer a threat. UPDATE: Suspect is in custody and not a threat. PIO will be onscene shortly to share updates. — Alexandria Police (@Alexandria Police)1497443034.0 Brooks appeared on CNN to describe how he was on deck waiting to bat during the practice when he heard gun shots. He described how the shooter was subdued, but only after he shot at least five people. Brooks and his colleagues then rushed into the outfield to assist Scalise, who had left a ""trail of blood"" while he dragged himself from second base to the outfield. Brooks said he got a look at the gunman and described him as a white male who was ""a bit on the chubby side."" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) subsequently told CNN that the shooter was a white male in his 40s or 50s. Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said that his officers arrived on the scene within three minutes of people called, but wouldn't give any other information about the shooter. He confirmed that five people were transported medically from the scene. Scalise was taken to MedStar Health in Columbia, Maryland, where he underwent surgery to treat his wound. BREAKING: House Majority Whip Steve Scalise appears to have been shot in Alexandria, VA, GOP Rep. Mo Brooks says https://t.co/IVQc8RHXL8 — CNN (@CNN)1497441992.0 Sen. Rand Paul, who was also at the practice, told MSNBC that he heard between 50 to 60 shots fired by the gunman. He said he believed the shooter was using an AR-15-style rifle. ""Everybody would've died except for the fact that Capitol Hill police were there,"" Paul said. President Donald Trump released a statement saying that he was ""deeply saddened by this tragedy"" and that he offered ""thoughts and prayers"" to everyone who was affected by the shooting. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, a true friend and patriot, was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him. — Donald J. Trump (@Donald J. Trump)1497444506.0 Watch live video coverage of the shooting below.   An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter. Whallon-Wolkind's identity as the unindicted co-conspirator was first reported by Alan Feuer, a reporter for the New York Times, on Twitter on Thursday. A knowledgeable source speaking on condition of anonymity provided the same information to Raw Story.                    No investigative story ever really ends. If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost."" The Washington Post published an excerpt from the book this week, and in the excerpt, Bender discusses a ""group of Trump's most hardcore rallygoers"" known as the Front Row Joes.

Mass shootings like the Wednesday morning attack that wounded Rep. Steve Scalise are clarifying moments for most presidents, ones that test their ability to comfort a frightened nation and rise above the partisan fray. This will require a very different demeanor for President Trump, who has taken to Twitter to send out inflammatory — and often inaccurate — comments after terror attacks like the recent suicide bombing in Manchester, England. Trump’s initial comments after the shooting that wounded Scalise and four others were classy, restrained, and clearly scripted. “We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nation’s capital is here because, above all, they love our country,” Trump said. “Please take a moment today to cherish those you love, and always remember those who serve and keep us safe.” Whether he can stay on message when he turns off his teleprompter and goes back to Twitter remains to be seen — especially if the conservative media he consumes so obsessively blames the Scalise attack on Democrats. Take Trump’s response to the deadly assault in London earlier this month, which killed seven people and wounded dozens more. The president first used it to renew calls for his travel ban. He tweeted out unverified information labeling it a terror attack long before authorities had done so (NBC News memorably responded with a tweet explaining they weren’t “relaying president’s retweet, as the info is unconfirmed”). And he took London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s words out of context to make it seem as if Khan were dismissing the terror threat when he was instead trying to urge public calm. What Trump didn’t do, in any of those tweets or his subsequent public remarks, was try to reassure the American public that a terror attack in London didn’t mean that ISIS militants lurked just around every corner here at home. In the aftermath of the Scalise attack and the mass shooting in San Francisco that left three dead, the true test of the president will be what he says — and, more importantly, manages to avoid saying — in the days to come. On April 28, 2017, Trump strode into a packed auditorium in Atlanta and told National Rifle Association members who had gathered for the group’s annual convention that “the eight-year assault on your Second Amendment freedoms has come to a crashing end.” Trump’s rollicking speech amounted to a high-profile thank-you to the NRA, which gave him $30 million and whose members backed him overwhelmingly. “You have a true friend and champion in the White House,” he added. The rapturous reception obscured the fact that gun rights are a delicate issue for the president. The lifelong New York City resident has never shown a particular interest in guns or hunting. (That’s not the case with his two older sons, who have boasted about hunting big game and posted pictures of themselves with dead leopards and other animals.) The second is that Trump’s views on guns have changed markedly over time and largely focused on the threat posed by Islamist extremists, not disenchanted white men like James T. Hodgkinson, the alleged shooter in today’s attack in Virginia. Take the decades-long debate over banning the kind of assault rifles used in the mass murder of dozens of children and other innocents in Sandy Hook and San Bernardino. As NPR has detailed, Trump, in his 2000 book The America We Deserve, supported the 10-year ban on the weapons that then-President Bill Clinton had signed into law in 1994 (the law lapsed and hasn’t been renewed). ""I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun,"" Trump wrote. ""With today's Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record."" Trump dropped that position during a March 2016 debate, when he said, “I don’t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault"" weapons. PolitiFact promptly labeled it a “full flop.” Presidents of both parties have shone after mass shootings, often managing to successfully tread the line between mourning the dead and reassuring the living. Take George W. Bush, who traveled to Virginia Tech in April 2007 after a student killed 32 people, including 27 students, in what remains the deadliest attack on a university in American history. ""It's impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering,"" Bush said in a six-minute address in the school’s Cassell Coliseum. ""Those whose lives were taken did nothing to deserve their fate. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now they're gone — and they leave behind grieving families, and grieving classmates, and a grieving nation."" Or take Barack Obama, who memorably brushed away a tear while speaking to reporters at the White House after the slaughter of 20 elementary school students and six adult staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. ""The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of 5 and 10 years old,"" Obama said. ""Our hearts are broken today for the parents and grandparents, sisters and brothers, of these children."" Trump has yet to confront mass killings on the scale of Sandy Hook or Virginia Tech. I pray he never has to, even though I fear — given how easy it is to acquire military-grade weaponry — that he eventually will. The question Trump will face then, as he faces to a lesser degree now, is whether he’ll be able to comfort a worried nation as well as his predecessors did, and whether he’ll have an answer to the scourge of mass shootings that continue to plague America. Trump knew how to campaign for the presidency, and for today, at least, he showed that he also knows how to act presidential. The question now is whether he can continue to be what the country needs him to be in the days to come. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Two protesters interrupted the Public Theater’s Shakespeare in the Park performance of Julius Caesar on Friday night, with one of them crashing the stage to yell, “Stop the normalization of political violence against the right! This is unacceptable!"" The production, which features a Donald Trump-esque figure in its title role, has been a target of right-wing outrage since before its official opening on June 12. Because the 400-year-old play sees Julius Caesar assassinated by members of the Roman Senate — and thus, in this production, it’s the Trump-esque figure who meets an untimely demise — the Public Theater’s staging has drawn condemnation from news outlets such as Breitbart and Fox News and lost the support of two corporate sponsors as a result. Related The incident on Friday night was filmed by one of the two protesters, Jack Posobiec,  who posted video footage on Twitter: BREAKING: Julius Ceasar Gets SHUTDOWN pic.twitter.com/ITgfMR0tHE The woman in the video has been identified as Laura Loomer, who, according to the New York Times, is a self-described “right-wing investigative journalist and activist.” As Loomer approaches the stage, Posobiec yells and gestures toward his fellow theatergoers, calling them Nazis, likening them to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, and seemingly blaming the production for Wednesday’s mass shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, by screaming, “The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!” The Times reports that Loomer was ultimately charged with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct and released — in part because she would not step away from Central Park’s Delacorte Theater, where Julius Caesar is being performed, upon being escorted out. “Because of liberal violence like this, a congressman this week was shot in Virginia,” she reportedly declared. I'm out of jail, but I'm not apologetic. Thanks to everyone who is supporting me & condemning political violence. https://t.co/QkZkxu1yCj Such claims have been a theme among many on the right in the aftermath of the shooting, which left House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) critically wounded. As Vox’s Jeff Guo writes: Many Republicans condemned Democrats and the “liberal media” for promoting a combative tone against the GOP. They pointed to raucous town halls, protests in the streets, and, of course, that controversial photo of Kathy Griffin holding a bloodied, beheaded figure of Trump. ""The rhetoric has been outrageous: The finger-pointing, the tone, the angst and the anger directed at Donald Trump,” complained Chris Collins, a Republican representative from New York. Related And since the shooting happened in the same week that the uproar over Julius Caesar hit a fever pitch, some — including both Friday’s protesters, apparently, as well as the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. — have been quick to draw a direct connection between the shooting and the play: This https://t.co/RD5jExTSjc Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President But as many Shakespeare fans and scholars have been pointing out since the outrage over the Public Theater’s Trump-tinged production first began to draw criticism, Julius Caesar is an inherently political play with warnings for everyone — and one that specifically implores those who commit political violence, even in service of their country, to consider the futility of their actions. It also lends itself to different interpretations for different political contexts. As Alissa Wilkinson writes for Vox: Julius Caesar is a political play, one that plumbs the uneasy relationship between power and populism, as well as the conflicts that arise between personal relationships and loyalty to country. It even explores the pitfalls of various forms of government, from democracy’s potential for mob rule manipulated by showy speakers to the potential for personal power seeking in a republic to the dangers of iron-fisted, people-crushing authoritarian rule. And thus, with regard to the Public Theater’s production of Julius Caesar in particular, Wilkinson explains that those who’ve argued that it incites violence are completely missing the point: You can only read Julius Caesar as a simple revenge fantasy if you don’t actually read the play. And casting a Trump-like character as Julius Caesar does a lot more for him than merely let an audience watch him get assassinated onstage. Just as Julius Caesar is a play with many warnings, a specifically Trump-oriented Julius Caesar contains many warnings and implications — and bafflingly, right-wing media hasn’t bothered to point them out. ... Opponents of the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar, if they were familiar with the text, could have seized on the chance this production handed them. For one, it puts Trump in the position of the beloved leader of the people, casting him as a legendary hero. And it warns about the futility of violence against him (something that has new resonance in the wake of controversy over Kathy Griffin’s “beheading” of the president). A canny right-wing response to the production could have praised it for embedding conservative and even Trump-supporting ideas inside the more obvious, arguably even ham-fisted depiction of the president. (National Review came closest to this approach, calling it “boring.”) But Friday’s protesters clearly viewed the Public Theater’s production of Julius Caesar as a call for violence against the right. As for what happened post-protest during Friday night’s performance, the Public Theater’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis, gave a statement to the Daily Beast in which he characterized the incident as a both minor and meaningful: Two protesters disrupted our show tonight; we stopped the show for less than a minute and our stage manager handled it beautifully. The staff removed the protesters peacefully, and the show resumed with the line ‘Liberty! Freedom!’ The audience rose to their feet to thank the actors, and we joyfully continued.

Controversial because the actor playing the assassinated Caesar looked and sounded like Donald Trump, right down to the overlong red necktie and clownish orange-blond nimbus of hair. But the curtain didn’t fall because of the outrage that came tumbling from the right — including protesters heckling at a couple of the performances and death threats directed at the production’s director (not to mention feverish tweets and emails from confused trolls hurled at any theatre company with the word “Shakespeare” in its name). Nor did it occur because two of The Public Theatre’s corporate donors, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines, pulled their sponsorship of the show, a gutless move of appeasement from two businesses, banking and air travel, so well known these days for their dazzling records of customer satisfaction. (Another company, American Express, didn’t yank its cash from The Public but tweeted that its money doesn’t fund Shakespeare in the Park “nor do we condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play.”) No, the fact is, Julius Caesar always was scheduled to end the night that it did. That was to make way for the summer’s second Shakespeare in the Park production — A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Gentle readers will recall that this is the Shakespeare play in which, among a great many other things, a knavish sprite named Puck turns a man into an ass. Such an act once seemed like magic, but given today’s political climate, the turning of men into asses has become the rule rather than the exception. Witness the aforementioned kneejerk reaction of the right, so quick to accuse the left of behaving like snowflakes but themselves so hypersensitive to even the mildest heat that they melt as fast as Frosty the Snowman — that is, if he was a whiny Fox or talk radio host instead of a jolly happy soul. We’ve established before that this is not a crowd that embraces a thoroughgoing knowledge of history in general, and it’s probably fair to assume a knowledge of theatrical history not at all. Elsewise they might realize that Julius Caesar is not a play that celebrates political violence but loudly condemns it. In an email, The Public’s artistic director (and director of Julius Caesar) Oskar Eustis wrote: Back in the day, Queen Elizabeth I herself recognized that the playwright’s scripts often were thinly veiled depictions of the current political scene in Britain and even of herself. Apparently, she had a thicker skin than the gang at Delta Air Lines or Bank of America — she kept encouraging Shakespeare with money from the royal purse. Julius Caesar in particular has always been a play lending itself to parallels with contemporary politics. George Washington hosted an amateur production in Philadelphia during the first full year of his presidency. He didn’t seem to take offense. Orson Welles directed and played Brutus in a 1937 staging that drew parallels with the rise of fascism in Europe, even recreating the infamous “Cathedral of Light” at Hitler’s Nuremburg rallies. For the last few years, The Acting Company has been touring the country with a version in which Caesar bears a close resemblance to Barack Obama — no one has protested. And ever since Trump started to dominate the electoral landscape, several productions have used Julius Caesar as a metaphor for the debilitating illness that pervades our body politic. Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro recently wrote: “It is the mark of a tolerant society that we don’t try to shut down the expression of words or viewpoints that some might find disagreeable, least of all Shakespeare’s, whose works we all share. “We rely on newspapers to learn what is happening in the world. But we turn to productions of Shakespeare to make sense of it.” But none of this stopped the trolls of the right from throwing a major-league hissy about the show, even if very few of them actually attended a performance. Much of the consternation was based on a video of the play’s assassination scene that went viral. Some, Sean Hannity among them, even suggested that the recent wounding of House majority whip Steve Scalise and four others at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, somehow was linked to the production of Julius Caesar. “The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!” screamed one of those who disrupted a performance. And the president’s son, Donald Jr., retweeted conservative commentator Harlan Hill’s comment that the shootings were “EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our president.” This was and is opportunistic sophistry, an attempt to use tragedy to distract by aiming a fallacious attack at “elites” and the left. The production of Julius Caesar should no more be condemned for its alleged connection to an act of senseless violence than The Catcher in the Rye should be banned because John Lennon’s assassin Mark David Chapman was obsessed with the book. The attack on Scalise and the others was the act of a deeply disturbed man who had made anti-Trump statements on Facebook and elsewhere. And there’s no denying that it took place in an atmosphere of elevated hate speech from right and left — but face it, mostly from the right — and violence that has only gotten worse since the election, aggravated by the man now president who egged on his supporters at splenetic campaign rallies. But let’s talk about what also really needs discussing. Not just a production of a classic play that offended some, or the unreasoned words and actions of far too many, including men and women in Congress and the White House. Since we’re talking about the freedom to speak out, let’s speak out about guns. For one, given the mental state of the man accused with the Scalise shooting why was he allowed to have weapons? As my colleague Michael Hiltzik at the Los Angeles Times wrote: Too soon? Let’s pray for Steve Scalise’s continued recovery but not forget his A+ rating from the National Rifle Association or, say, his opposition to stricter gun laws after 26 died in the Sandy Hook shootings of 2014. Hiltzik noted: “Among the bills he has cosponsored is the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, a 2011 measure that would have allowed anyone with a valid state-issued concealed firearm permit to carry a concealed firearm in any other state that issues concealed firearm permits, regardless of the other states’ standards for issuing those permits. On Jan. 6, 2016, Scalise could be seen on CNN misrepresenting, and then assailing, President Obama’s day-old executive order designed to tighten the rules on background checks of gun buyers.” Counting the Scalise incident, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker, as of June 25, 2017, so far this year there have been 211 mass shootings in the United States. Guns have killed more than 6,800 in America this year; 13,500 have been wounded, according to Chelsea Parsons, vice president of guns and crime policy at the Center for American Progress. In a recent op-ed, Parsons pointed out out the gun fatality rate in this country is 25 times greater than in other high-income countries. And yes, as the argument goes, more people might have died in Alexandria if Scalise had not had armed police protection with him, but they were trained professionals, not the amateurs — including members of Congress — who want to run around with concealed carry permits and handguns wherever they choose. But that’s what the GOP wants. Jonathan Martin reported at The New York Times: “And that was before President Trump was elected with far more help from the National Rifle Association than Mitt Romney got in 2012. Mr. Trump received more money from the NRA than any other outside group.” The counterintuitive argument that the answer to guns is more guns is madness. As Marc Antony says in Julius Caesar, during his famous oration at the funeral of the murdered leader, “O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.” Too soon?

A few hours after James Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican congresspeople and their staffs in Alexandria, Virginia, a gunman in San Francisco shot and killed three people and himself while wounding two others at a UPS factory. Three hours later, gunfire erupted at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, injuring one. The Alexandria shooting resulted in a fierce partisan gun control debate between Democrats and Republicans as lawmakers and pundits took to Twitter to express their concerns. The debate ended up playing out in real time as two more shootings occurred. The shootings also took place two days after the year anniversary of the Orlando Pulse shooting that claimed 49 lives at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there Alexandria baseball field shooting marked the 154th mass shooting this year, and the UPS factory shooting brings that number to 155.

Jerrod Carmichael wants to help people “talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way.” The Carmichael Show, an NBC sitcom that routinely tackles difficult subjects and social issues, was supposed to air an episode on the evening of Wednesday, June 14, that deals with the aftermath of a mass shooting. But earlier that day, very real mass shootings occurred in Alexandria, Virginia, and San Francisco. NBC ended up pulling the episode, titled “Shoot-Up-Able,” in the wake of those shootings and airing a completely unrelated one instead — a move that Carmichael Show creator and star Jerrod Carmichael says he understands but vehemently disagrees with. On this week’s new episode of Netflix’s Chelsea talk show — which was taped the day of the shootings, after NBC made the call to pull the episode — Carmichael brought up the decision himself to express his disappointment that it wouldn’t air at the exact time when he feels it could have been the most helpful. ""I thought that [the] episode would have an opportunity to talk about these tragedies in a meaningful way, to really lend itself to conversation,"" Carmichael said. ""A lot of times when things like this happen and someone wants to talk about it in an outlet that's not the news, people will say, 'Too soon.' But when is it not too soon? Unfortunately, these things happen constantly, and it's a thing that breaks all of our hearts."" “Shoot-Up-Able” doesn’t depict a mass shooting, but instead focuses on the complicated feelings that Carmichael’s character grapples with after having survived one. “When something like this happens, we realize that we all suffer from fear of going out, fear of enjoying your life,” Carmichael continued. “We all suffer from the pain of knowing that families have lost loved ones. And that’s what the episode is about.” While Carmichael insisted during his Chelsea appearance that he does understand the thinking behind NBC’s decision, he also argued that the network did “a disservice” to its viewers. “What it says is that you don't think America is smart enough to handle real dialogue and something that reflects real family conversations and something that feels honest and true and still respects the victims,"" Carmichael said. ""We handled the episode with as much love and integrity as we could. To pull that is just criminal. It does a disservice to the viewer, it does a disservice to you, it does a disservice to all of us."" The Carmichael Show, which is now in its third season, has made a name for itself by taking on subjects that other family sitcoms rarely touch. Previous seasons have devoted episodes to abortion and Bill Cosby’s legacy, and an upcoming episode in season three will air the n-word multiple times as the Carmichael family debates its use. So it’s not surprising that The Carmichael Show would take on mass shootings, nor that Carmichael himself would be disappointed that NBC pulled the episode and cut off the very thing the show values most: an open, honest dialogue about hard topics that many are often too afraid to touch. The Carmichael Show currently airs Wednesdays at 9 pm on NBC; seasons one and two are streaming on Netflix, and previous episodes of season three are streaming on NBC.com and Hulu. Carmichael’s episode of Chelsea is streaming on Netflix. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

463,http://www.rawstory.com/2017/06/representative-steve-scalise-is-out-of-icu/,"Steve Scalise, the Louisiana lawmaker shot last week at a U.S. congressional baseball team practice, is no longer in the intensive care unit of the hospital where he is being treated and remains in fair condition, the hospital said on Friday. Scalise was shot in the hip on June 14 when a lone gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for an annual charity game against the Democrats. He entered the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries. ""Congressman Steve Scalise’s continued good progress allowed him to be transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on Thursday,"" said MedStar Washington Hospital Center. ""He remains in fair condition as he continues an extended period of healing and rehabilitation,"" the hospital said in a statement posted on its web site. Matt Mika, a lobbyist wounded in the same shooting at an Alexandria, Virginia ball field, has been released from George Washington University Hospital, his family said in a statement on Friday. Local media reported that Mika, a Tyson Foods lobbyist, was visited before leaving in his hospital room by Jayson Werth, a Washington Nationals star player. Scalise, 51, is the No. 3 Republican in the House. He, Mika and others were shot or otherwise injured in a mass shooting carried out by James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, who later died in the hospital of gunshot wounds. The FBI, which investigated the incident, said on Wednesday that Hodgkinson did not post online any threats against or references to members of Congress before the attack. The agent said authorities found a laptop computer, a cell phone and a digital camera in Hodgkinson's car after the incident, and 200 rounds of ammunition in a storage locker Hodgkinson had rented in April in Alexandria. The shooting occurred as 25 to 30 Republican members of the House and Senate had gathered for an early morning practice a day before the annual charity game, which was played on June 15. With many players on both teams wearing hats to honor Scalise, the game was won by the Democrats, 11-2, but they loaned the trophy to the Republicans until Scalise is better. As the game was about to begin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi stood side by side at Washington's Nationals Park to shout: “Let’s play ball!” (Reporting by Rick Cowan; Additional reportng by Jon Herskovitz; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Simon Cameron-Moore) An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter.

          July  9, 2018  5:34 pm Scroll down Mass shootings per 100,000 people since 2013: No. of incidents: Population: Sources: Gunpolicy.org , United Nations Development Programme Each block represents 10 gun-related deaths in 2016 - Mass shooting - Homicide - Suicide - Other or undetermined Source: CDC On December 14, 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. By June 12, 2016, when a shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, led to 50 deaths, there had been 994 more shootings.

Orlando was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history… …until October 1, 2017, when a gunman fired into a crowd at a music festival on the Las Vegas strip, killing 59. Then on February 14, 2018, a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17. In total, there have been at least {total} mass shootings since Sandy Hook, with at least {total_killed} killed and {total_wounded} wounded. The map shows that almost no state is immune to mass gun violence, even as crime and murder rates have generally declined in the past couple of decades. America is a big outlier among developed countries when it comes to gun deaths — in large part because it has so many guns, making it easy to carry out an act of violence. Studies have linked stricter gun laws to fewer gun deaths. But the US has the weakest gun laws in the developed world. As shocking as mass shootings are, they are responsible for only a small portion of all gun deaths.

In 2016, according to the CDC, 39,000 people died of gun-related injuries. Each block here represents 10 gun-related deaths. Mass shooting deaths represented less than 2 percent of all gun deaths in the US that year — 451 of nearly 39,000 overall gun deaths. Meanwhile, more than 14,000 of the gun deaths that year were homicides, and almost 23,000 — the great majority — were suicides.

Last week, several top Democrats were targeted by pipe bombs, two black Americans were killed in what appeared to be a racially-motivated murder, and a terror attack against Jewish Americans in their place of worship that left 11 people dead. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed a host of terror attacks and mass shootings — in San Bernardino, in Colorado Springs, in Charleston, in Orlando, in Chattanooga, in Santa Barbara, in Fort Hood, in Santa Monica, in Newtown, in Minneapolis, in Aurora, in Oakland. The motives in each of these attacks vary, but they’re all united by the common thread of violence. They also raise difficult questions, like: are American growing more violent? Are we regressing into something akin to what we saw in the 1960s, an era marked by assassinations, civil unrest, and political chaos? Has the cocktail of guns, polarization, and alienation made mass shootings a permanent feature of American life? To get some answers, I reached out to seven experts to see if they thought that politically motivated violence was on the rise. Their responses were mixed, but most are convinced that we’re experiencing an uptick — and that once this sort of violence takes root, it is hard to stop. Read their responses, which have been lightly edited for clarity, below. Are we becoming a more violent country? Answered as a simple yes-or-no question, the answer appears to be “yes.” But in truth, the question is more complex. Last week saw an outburst of violence, all of it tied, in one way or another, to the rising intensity of the political climate as midterm elections near. In the lead up to those elections, political rhetoric is becoming increasingly heated, as are the emotions of many Americans. And with the rise in violent rhetoric, we’ve seen a tragic rise in violence. As a broad phenomenon, this is nothing new. The United States has a long history of voter intimidation and election day rioting, and some riots have even resulted in deaths. What’s distinctive about our current moment is that the president of the United States himself is using violent rhetoric. As the nation’s elected leader, his words have added weight, so when he brands certain Americans “the enemy” or suggests that they’re destroying the republic, it matters; it potentially encourages and excites extreme action. To begin to judge the long term effects of this electoral uptick in attack-talk and attacks, we’ll have to watch events after the election, when the heat of the chase begins to dissipate. I’ve spent decades researching how and why civil wars start, and people have been asking me whether the US could experience a second civil war. Up until 2016, I would have said no, because the US had none of the risk factors known to lead to civil war. But that has changed. The two best predictors of whether a country will experience a civil war is whether it is moving toward or away from democracy, and whether its population is polarized. And Americans now live in an increasingly polarized world with a strongman leader intent on subverting democracy. Until 2016, the US was categorized as a full democracy alongside countries like Switzerland, Canada, and Australia (Polity IV data). Experts now consider it a flawed democracy, in the same category as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and South Africa. American citizens may think they still live in a full democracy, but they don’t. They are moving down the democracy scale toward the middle zone. Americans are also becoming more polarized ... and not surprisingly, violence is increasing. The U.S. was recently placed on the list of “most worsened countries” for political stability by the Fund for Peace, a non-profit dedicated to preventing violent conflict. It has also dropped more than any other country in the world on the Global Peace Index, an index that measures the relative likelihood of peace in countries, declining eleven places to rank 114th out of 163 countries for peacefulness. Americans aren’t becoming a more violent people, per se. We have always had violence within us and the means to pursue it. What has changed is the motivation to use violence.  As democratic norms and practices have eroded, and people have become more fearful of different segments of society, the incentive to turn to violence has increased. This has been stoked by President Trump. We’re in the same place now as we were a year ago after the Las Vegas massacre — which is to say, not in a good place at all. The top-down rhetoric of divisiveness and intolerance continues to have a corrosive effect. For example, President Trump did his best to turn a minor Fox News segment about a group of migrants fleeing violence in Central America and moving northward into a border crisis for the United States — and he succeeded. The president claimed that “criminals and unknown Middle Easterners” were in the group, a claim without any basis in fact. Before attacking worshipers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the shooter railed on social media about Jews who had aided and abetted the “caravan” of “invaders.” The murders in Pittsburgh followed a week in which one man mailed bombs to almost a dozen Trump critics and another man deliberately shot two African Americans at a Kroger in Louisville after trying to target a black church. President Trump continues to vilify the media, and then acts surprised when journalists are attacked. In failing to denounce white supremacists unequivocally, Trump has provided a warm spot under his wing where alt-right extremists have found a place to nest. If he is capable of moderating his rhetoric, swearing off acrimony, and creating unity, then now would be a good time to do it. Words matter. Political rhetoric matters. With this past week’s tragic events, it makes sense to stop and take stock of what the trends in mass violence have been over the last few years. We hear a great deal that political violence his risen dramatically. But is that really true? It’s hard to know without a detailed analysis, but one thing we can do easily is look at trends in mass shootings using data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which defines a mass shooting as any event with four or more casualties in one event not including the shooter. This measure combines many kinds of gun violence, but if politically-motivated attacks using guns are rising significantly, that should show up in the data unless there is some countervailing trend in other kinds of gun violence. So what do we see in the trends? First, there is indeed a long-term rise in the frequency of mass shooting events. That trend largely parallels the overall trends in violent crime (there were 369 incidents per 100,000 in 2013 and 394 per 100,000 in 2017 according to FBI statistics), making it hard to know if there something specifically political about the trend. One simple way to try to get at the source of the increase is to analyze trends separately in states President Trump won in 2016 vs. those in which he lost. As you can see in the figure below, doing so shows that the upward trend in the rate of mass shootings since 2013 is larger in states that President Trump carried. However, there is no discernible increase in the rate of mass shootings since President Trump took office in Nov. 2016. Seeing exactly what is going on is challenging because there are more mass shootings in the summer, but two observations stand out. First, these is a large increase in Summer ’15 compared to Summer ’14 in states where the president won. Second, Summer and Fall ‘16 saw more frequent mass shootings than earlier periods in both kinds of states. Whatever is driving the trend over time, it does not appear to have gotten worse since the 2016 election. Since summer 2013 the frequency of mass shootings has gone up more in places which supported President Trump in 2016 than in places which did not. One can interpret that many ways. What is clear is that the aggregate data are consistent with the claim that politically-motivated violence is on the rise. Given history as baseline, I would say that the United States is not becoming a more violent people, a more violent country. The United States was much worse in its past and one of the reasons why violence is so low in frequency, intensity and scope now is because of how much bloodshed has been spilt to get to this point. We need to remember that violence has generally been a small (albeit noteworthy and newsworthy) fragment of human interaction. Most of our lives are spent in various degrees of peaceful harmony or, as discussed in my recent book, some place along a peace continuum. That said, it’s important to consistently question the violent nature of a country that spends more than half of its tax dollars on the military and national security. If the identity of the US is so intricately connected with militarism, weapons, imprisonment (without the objective of reform), harsh sentencing, aggressive/intimidating policing, the death penalty and interventionism (at home as well as abroad), then the existence of violent episodes like the most recent tragedy in Pittsburgh fits a broader pattern — perhaps not in frequency, severity or scope but in intent and form. America was decidedly violent long before Cesar Sayoc (the recent mail bomber) and Robert Bowers (the man who attacked the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh) burst into public view. Nevertheless, we might take this moment to reflect on the condition of American politics and the violence that too often characterizes it. Even before Trump, the Republican Party deemed itself the sole legitimate force in American political life. As such it is unwilling to compromise with adversaries. Think here, for example, of its determination to destroy Barack Obama’s presidency from day one, or its perverse insistence on confirming Brett Kavanaugh, a dime a dozen right-wing jurist. The Republican Party is also willing to do anything to keep itself in power regardless of its effect on democracy. And why not? It does not believe in democracy. Think of its nationwide efforts to suppress voter turnout, especially but not exclusively along racial lines. In short, the GOP has made it clear, in word and deed, that it has no intention of sharing a polity with others. We should be even more concerned about the effect that Trump’s ascendancy (and the Republican Party’s fealty to him) is having on the United States. Public discourse has become particularly venomous, and it’s an open question as to how that discourse might encourage or embolden certain people to act. On any number of occasions Trump has expressed his approval — explicitly and implicitly — of violence against a wide range of political opponents, which he considers enemies. When Trump and the GOP communicate to their constituencies that they are under attack by foreigners or by foreign elements in America, and that their very way of life is in danger and needs to be protected, this kind of narrative and rhetoric can have pernicious effects. When they’re matched by grandiose actions (like Trump sending thousands of troops to the southern border to protect the nation from desperate refugees), many of those who nurture a deep sense of rage and resentment about a “lost” country, and many of those who consider themselves true patriots are only too happy to take matters into their own hands and deliver a decisive blow for what they hold sacred. So it shouldn’t surprise anyone when white nationalists take up the calls to arms that Trump and his Republican lieutenants have issued. The latter will disavow the likes of Sayoc and Bowers, of course, but continue to feed the passions that helped manufacture these culture warriors. In the longer term (1800s to today), we are definitely a less violent place. This isn’t the 1850s, the civil war era, the 1960s, or any other exceptionally violent period. There is, however, an uptick in political violence. I hesitate to lay this all at the feet of our current president, though. Like Brazil, Hungary, Russia, and others, we elected a right-wing populist with little concern for democratic norms and processes. There are enough people on the left and right that feel they are not gaining from participation in institutional politics. That is a worrisome and a violence-enhancing trend. Most of the intense political violence we currently see is from people like Dylan Roof ( the Charleston church shooter) or Robert Bowers ( the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter) or James Hodgkinson (Republican baseball team shooter). The terrifying thing about what we’re seeing now is that anyone could be an attacker, and these attacks seem to develop through online interactions that escalate, and it is extremely difficult to stop. The upside of individual politically-motivated violence compared to organized group violence is that it is less sustained and less of an existential threat to the state. That is no consolation to the families of the victims. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism? Millions turn to Vox to understand what’s happening in the news.

466,http://www.rawstory.com/2017/06/the-domestic-terror-threat-from-americas-right-wing-is-on-the-rise-heres-why/,"The murder in College Park, Maryland of Richard Collins III, an African-American student who had recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was days away from his graduation from Bowie State University, underscores the violence of America’s far-right wing. Sean Urbanski, the University of Maryland student who allegedly stabbed Collins to death, belongs to a racist Facebook group called Alt-Reich: Nation. It makes sense that the FBI is helping the police investigate this incident as a suspected hate crime. But my 15 years experience of studying violent extremism in Western societies has taught me that dealing effectively with far-right violence requires something more: treating its manifestations as domestic terrorism. While attacks such as the recent suicide bombing in Manchester that left 22 people dead and several dozen injured will probably continue to garner more headlines, this growing domestic menace deserves more attention than it’s getting. Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare. Most terrorist groups lack the resources, expertise and manpower to defeat state actors. Instead, they promote their agenda through violence that shapes perceptions of political and social issues. Collins’ murder, if it was motivated by racist sentiments, should be treated as an act of domestic terrorism, which I define here as the use of violence in a political and social context that aims to send a message to a broader target audience. Like lynching, cross-burning and vandalizing religious sites, incidents of this kind deliberately aim to terrorize people of color and non-Christians. I consider domestic terrorism a more significant threat than the foreign-masterminded variety in part because it is more common in terms of the number of attacks on U.S. soil. For example, my report published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point identified hundreds of domestic terror incidents per year between 2008 and 2012. Another report initially published in 2014 by New America Foundation on domestic incidents of extremist violence shows that excluding the Orlando nightclub massacre, between 2002-2016, far-right affiliated perpetrators conducted 18 attacks that killed 48 people in the United States, while terrorists motivated by al-Qaida’s or the Islamic State’s ideology killed 45 people in nine attacks. The Orlando mass shooting, given its mix of apparent motives, is hard to categorize. In briefings with law enforcement and policymakers, I have sometimes encountered a tendency to see U.S. right-wing extremists as a monolith. But traditional Ku Klux Klan chapters operate differently than skinhead groups, as do anti-government “patriot” and militia groups and anti-abortion extremists. Christian Identity groups, which believe Anglo-Saxons and other people of Northern European descent are a chosen people, are distinct too. Certainly, there is some overlap. But these groups also differ significantly in terms of their methods of violence, recruitment styles and ideologies. Across the board, undermining the threat they pose requires a more sophisticated approach than investigating their criminal acts as suspected hate crimes. In an ongoing study I’m conducting at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with several students, we have determined that, as apparently occurred with Collins’ recent murder in Maryland, many attacks inspired by racist or xenophobic sentiments may appear spontaneous. That is, no one plans them in advance or targets the victim ahead of time. Instead, chance encounters that enrage the perpetrators trigger these incidents. Sporadic attacks with high numbers of casualties that are plotted in advance, such as Dylann Roof’s murder of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina church, are always big news. More typical incidents of far-right violence tend to draw less attention.   AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster The fatal stabbing of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Ricky John Best aboard a train in Portland, Oregon on May 26 seems to be emerging as an exception. The alleged killer of these two white men, Jeremy Joseph Christian, attacked them with a knife after they stood up to him for haranguing two young women who appeared to be Muslim, police said. A third injured passenger is expected to survive. Much of the media coverage is focused on Christian’s violent and racist background. Given the spontaneous nature of so much far-right violence, U.S. counterterrorism policies should, in my view, target the dissemination of white supremacist ideology, rather than just identifying planned attacks and monitoring established white supremacy groups. The number of violent attacks on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology has spiked since the beginning of this century, rising from a yearly avarage of 70 attacks in the 1990s to a yearly avarage of more than 300 since 2001. These incidents have grown even more common since President Donald Trump’s election. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that researches U.S. extremism, reported 900 bias-related incidents against minorities in the first 10 days after Trump’s election – compared to several dozen in a normal week – and the group found that many of the harassers invoked the then-president-elect’s name. Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that tracks anti-Semitism, recorded an 86 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the first three months of 2017. Beyond the terror that victimized communities are experiencing, I would argue that this trend reflects a deeper social change in American society. The iceberg model of political extremism, initially developed by Ehud Shprinzak, an Israeli political scientist, can illuminate these dynamics. Murders and other violent attacks perpetrated by U.S. far-right extremists compose the visible tip of an iceberg. The rest of this iceberg is under water and out of sight. It includes hundreds of attacks every year that damage property and intimidate communities, such as the recent attempted burning of an African-American family’s garage in Schodack, New York. The garage was also defaced with racist graffiti. Data my team collected at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point show that the significant growth in far-right violence in recent years is happening at the base of the iceberg. While the main reasons for that are still not clear, it is important to remember that changes in societal norms are usually reflected in behavioral changes. Hence, it is more than reasonable to suspect that extremist individuals engage in such activities because they sense that their views are enjoying growing social legitimacy and acceptance, which is emboldening them to act on their bigotry. Despite an uptick in far-right violence and the Trump administration’s plan to increase the Department of Homeland Security budget by 6.7 percent to US$44.1 billion in 2018, the White House wants to cut spending for programs that fight non-Muslim domestic terrorism. The federal government has also frozen $10 million in grants aimed at countering domestic violent extremism. This approach is bound to weaken the authorities’ power to monitor far-right groups, undercutting public safety. How many more innocent people like Richard Collins III – and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Ricky John Best – have to die before the U.S. government starts taking the threat posed by violent white supremacists more seriously?

Michele Bachmann -- who called on her constituents to become ""armed and dangerous"" over an emissions tax for energy production -- rebuked comedians, media personalities and political figures for inspiring an Illinois man with a history of domestic violence to shoot two lawmakers and three others. ""The assassination plot directed at Republican members of Congress Wednesday morning is proof positive of Trump Derangement Syndrome,"" Bachmann told WND. ""The political left is more than unhinged; they have fallen into a dangerous delusion of their own making."" Republican majority whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX) were wounded Wednesday morning while practicing for a congressional baseball game, and two Capitol police officers and a legislative aide were also wounded. ""The assassin was a Bernie Sanders volunteer, Rachel Maddow fan, avid follower of Comedy Central and of Bill Maher,"" Bachmann said. ""The [would-be] assassin obviously listened well to his TV political ‘teachers’ and took his ‘resist’ marching orders to an unthinkable level, based upon the hysterical, fact-deprived, profanity-laced ravings of the lunatic left."" She called for a production of William Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar,"" which depicts the assassinated Roman emperor as a Trump-like figure, to be shut down after the mass shooting. ""The Trump assassination play in New York’s Central Park should close,"" Bachmann said. During her time in Congress, Bachmann was known for outrageous political rhetoric. ""Really now in Washington, I’m a foreign correspondent in enemy lines, and I try to keep everyone back here in Minnesota know exactly the nefarious activities that are taking place in Washington,"" Bachmann said in 2009, during the debate over the cap-and-trade energy tax. ""I want people in Minnesota armed and dangerous on this issue of the energy tax because we need to fight back. Thomas Jefferson told us, having a revolution every now and then is a good thing."" She helped promote and legitimize conspiracy theories questioning former President Barack Obama's birthplace, and she also suggested that he might be the antichrist and had ""been the best friend of terrorists."" “The Obama doctrine has been to offer aid and comfort to our enemies while he has cut off our allies,” Bachmann said. “Everything that he has done has been to lift up the agenda of Islamic jihad.

He described how the shooter was subdued, but only after he shot at least five people. Brooks and his colleagues then rushed into the outfield to assist Scalise, who had left a ""trail of blood"" while he dragged himself from second base to the outfield. Brooks said he got a look at the gunman and described him as a white male who was ""a bit on the chubby side."" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) subsequently told CNN that the shooter was a white male in his 40s or 50s. Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown said that his officers arrived on the scene within three minutes of people called, but wouldn't give any other information about the shooter. He confirmed that five people were transported medically from the scene. Scalise was taken to MedStar Health in Columbia, Maryland, where he underwent surgery to treat his wound.

Jones is known for his insistence that ""the left"" and ""global elites"" are staging mass shootings in order to make it easy for the U.S. government to confiscate people's firearms. He called the brutal massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut a ""false flag"" operation and insisted that the people involved were ""crisis actors"" hired by the government. On Wednesday, Sandy Phillips -- whose 24-year-old daughter Jessica Ghawi was shot and killed in the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, CO -- tweeted at Jones, ""Hey @RealAlexJones...is this a false flag shooting, too.

Jones regularly disseminates misinformation and conspiracy theories from his InfoWars.com website and daily radio broadcasts.

472,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/b-zDbwswM6Y/,"The murder in College Park, Maryland of Richard Collins III, an African-American student who had recently been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was days away from his graduation from Bowie State University, underscores the violence of America’s far-right wing. Sean Urbanski, the University of Maryland student who allegedly stabbed Collins to death, belongs to a racist Facebook group called Alt-Reich: Nation. It makes sense that the FBI is helping the police investigate this incident as a suspected hate crime. But my 15 years experience of studying violent extremism in Western societies has taught me that dealing effectively with far-right violence requires something more: treating its manifestations as domestic terrorism. While attacks such as the recent suicide bombing in Manchester that left 22 people dead and several dozen injured will probably continue to garner more headlines, this growing domestic menace deserves more attention than it’s getting. Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare. Most terrorist groups lack the resources, expertise and manpower to defeat state actors. Instead, they promote their agenda through violence that shapes perceptions of political and social issues. Collins’ murder, if it was motivated by racist sentiments, should be treated as an act of domestic terrorism, which I define here as the use of violence in a political and social context that aims to send a message to a broader target audience. Like lynching, cross-burning and vandalizing religious sites, incidents of this kind deliberately aim to terrorize people of color and non-Christians. I consider domestic terrorism a more significant threat than the foreign-masterminded variety in part because it is more common in terms of the number of attacks on U.S. soil. For example, my report published by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point identified hundreds of domestic terror incidents per year between 2008 and 2012. Another report initially published in 2014 by New America Foundation on domestic incidents of extremist violence shows that excluding the Orlando nightclub massacre, between 2002-2016, far-right affiliated perpetrators conducted 18 attacks that killed 48 people in the United States, while terrorists motivated by al-Qaida’s or the Islamic State’s ideology killed 45 people in nine attacks. The Orlando mass shooting, given its mix of apparent motives, is hard to categorize. In briefings with law enforcement and policymakers, I have sometimes encountered a tendency to see U.S. right-wing extremists as a monolith. But traditional Ku Klux Klan chapters operate differently than skinhead groups, as do anti-government “patriot” and militia groups and anti-abortion extremists. Christian Identity groups, which believe Anglo-Saxons and other people of Northern European descent are a chosen people, are distinct too. Certainly, there is some overlap. But these groups also differ significantly in terms of their methods of violence, recruitment styles and ideologies. Across the board, undermining the threat they pose requires a more sophisticated approach than investigating their criminal acts as suspected hate crimes. In an ongoing study I’m conducting at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with several students, we have determined that, as apparently occurred with Collins’ recent murder in Maryland, many attacks inspired by racist or xenophobic sentiments may appear spontaneous. That is, no one plans them in advance or targets the victim ahead of time. Instead, chance encounters that enrage the perpetrators trigger these incidents. Sporadic attacks with high numbers of casualties that are plotted in advance, such as Dylann Roof’s murder of nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina church, are always big news. More typical incidents of far-right violence tend to draw less attention. The fatal stabbing of Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Ricky John Best aboard a train in Portland, Oregon on May 26 seems to be emerging as an exception. The alleged killer of these two white men, Jeremy Joseph Christian, attacked them with a knife after they stood up to him for haranguing two young women who appeared to be Muslim, police said. A third injured passenger is expected to survive. Much of the media coverage is focused on Christian’s violent and racist background. Given the spontaneous nature of so much far-right violence, U.S. counterterrorism policies should, in my view, target the dissemination of white supremacist ideology, rather than just identifying planned attacks and monitoring established white supremacy groups. The number of violent attacks on U.S. soil inspired by far-right ideology has spiked since the beginning of this century, rising from a yearly avarage of 70 attacks in the 1990s to a yearly avarage of more than 300 since 2001. These incidents have grown even more common since President Donald Trump’s election. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that researches U.S. extremism, reported 900 bias-related incidents against minorities in the first 10 days after Trump’s election – compared to several dozen in a normal week – and the group found that many of the harassers invoked the then-president-elect’s name. Similarly, the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that tracks anti-Semitism, recorded an 86 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the first three months of 2017. Beyond the terror that victimized communities are experiencing, I would argue that this trend reflects a deeper social change in American society. The iceberg model of political extremism, initially developed by Ehud Shprinzak, an Israeli political scientist, can illuminate these dynamics. Murders and other violent attacks perpetrated by U.S. far-right extremists compose the visible tip of an iceberg. The rest of this iceberg is under water and out of sight. It includes hundreds of attacks every year that damage property and intimidate communities, such as the recent attempted burning of an African-American family’s garage in Schodack, New York. The garage was also defaced with racist graffiti. Data my team collected at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point show that the significant growth in far-right violence in recent years is happening at the base of the iceberg. While the main reasons for that are still not clear, it is important to remember that changes in societal norms are usually reflected in behavioral changes. Hence, it is more than reasonable to suspect that extremist individuals engage in such activities because they sense that their views are enjoying growing social legitimacy and acceptance, which is emboldening them to act on their bigotry. Despite an uptick in far-right violence and the Trump administration’s plan to increase the Department of Homeland Security budget by 6.7 percent to US$44.1 billion in 2018, the White House wants to cut spending for programs that fight non-Muslim domestic terrorism. The federal government has also frozen $10 million in grants aimed at countering domestic violent extremism. This approach is bound to weaken the authorities’ power to monitor far-right groups, undercutting public safety. How many more innocent people like Richard Collins III – and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Ricky John Best – have to die before the U.S. government starts taking the threat posed by violent white supremacists more seriously?

473,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/S63gNT0zTE4/,"Thousands of revelers, some waving rainbow flags symbolizing gay rights, crowded Washington streets on Saturday for the city's gay pride parade in an annual party that saw anti-corporate protesters briefly block its route. Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. Protesters who oppose the Capital Pride parade's corporate backing, which includes bank Wells Fargo & Co  and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp , briefly blocked the parade route and forced it to be rerouted. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter. The parade in the heavily Democratic U.S. capital featured T-shirts that said ""Love Trumps Hate,"" an apparent reference to President Donald Trump. The Republican has voiced support for gay rights but his administration has revoked federal guidelines that let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. Damian Jessup, 30, who traveled from Norfolk, Virginia, to march with gay Republicans, defended Trump and his support for gays. “I lost a lot of friends when I came out as Republican,"" said Jessup, who was wearing a Trump T-shirt. ""It’s harder to come out as Republican than to come out as gay."" The Washington parade came a day ahead of a so-called Resist March in Los Angeles against Trump, which is taking the place of the annual pride parade. In San Francisco, the SF Weekly newspaper reported the parade in that city would include a ""resistance contingent"" and an immigrant rights speaker. Early on Monday, the owner of the shuttered Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, is set to open its doors in remembrance of victims of a mass shooting there on June 12, 2016, that killed 49 people.

As captured by Media Matters, Raddatz's segment on desensitization to gun violence focuses specifically on the way journalists react to violence. ""We have become too numb to it all,"" Raddatz said. ""Massively desensitized to the carnage."" ""That, perhaps, includes us as journalists, who rush to cover the latest shooting and then move on to the next headline,"" Raddatz said, counting off the tragedies whose anniversaries media commemorated the same week as the baseball field shooting. ""Last Monday, one year since the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting. Forty-nine killed in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history,"" she said. ""And yesterday marked two years since nine were killed at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. Those mass shootings are seared in our collective memory, but in the past week alone, 262 people have lost their lives to gun violence across the U.S., 559 more wounded."" While the nation thinks of Scalise, Raddatz continued, they should also ""pause this morning to remember each and every life cut short by violence in our country."" ""As House Speaker Paul Ryan put it this week, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,"" she concluded. Watch the entire segment below via Media Matters.

475,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheRawStory/~3/v-a9EHsb0-o/,"More LGBT people were killed in the United States in 2016 than in any of the 20 years since record-keeping began, with the total boosted by the deaths of 49 people in an attack at a gay club in Florida last June, an advocacy group said on Monday. The release of a report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs coincides with the first anniversary of the massacre at Orlando's Pulse nightclub, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Excluding Pulse victims, 28 Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender were killed in 2016, which was up 17 percent from 24 killed the previous year, according to the annual report. The number of killings last year was the highest since 2012, when 25 LGBT people were killed. Including Pulse victims, murders of LGBT people rose 217 percent in 2016. Not all of those killed in the nightclub attack were LGBT. ""The enormous tragedy at Pulse Nightclub, in concert with the daily violence and discrimination that pervades our lives as LGBTQ people ... have created a perfect storm of fear and trauma for our communities this year,” Melissa Brown at the Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, a member of the coalition, said in a statement. The ""Q"" in ""LGBTQ"" refers ""queer,"" a term that avoids specifying sexual orientation or gender identity. The coalition, which has released the report since 1997, said LGBT people remain vulnerable to violence in 2017, especially in what it described as the current ""incendiary political climate."" “Recent executive orders as well as ongoing efforts to pass anti-LGBTQ legislation and roll back protections at the city, state, and federal level make LGBTQ people vulnerable to identity-based discrimination,"" Beverly Tillery, with the New York City Anti-Violence Project, said in a statement. Of the 2016 killings not connected to Pulse nightclub, 79 percent of victims were black or Hispanic and 68 percent were transgender. LGBT people of color and those with disabilities were more than twice as likely as whites and the able-bodied to be the victims of harassment and non-fatal forms of violence, the report said. Most of the victims knew their attackers, who commonly included employers, neighbors, landlords and family members, it said.

The private gathering at Orlando's Pulse nightclub at 2:02 a.m. (0602 GMT) was the first in a series of events at which victims' names will be memorialized with performances, prayers and candlelight vigils across the country on ""Orlando United Day."" On the first anniversary of the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, officials asked Americans to join in acts of ""love and kindness"" to honor victims of the three-hour June 12 rampage at the now-shuttered gay club, including survivors still reeling from emotional and physical wounds. ""Following the Pulse tragedy, we showed the world that Orlando would not be defined by the act of a hate-filled killer, but instead defined by our response of love, compassion and unity,"" Mayor Buddy Dyer wrote in a blog post. Hundreds gathered outside the club late Sunday and early Monday, including scores of people dressed in white with angels wings and carrying lanterns. The ""angels"" first appeared in the wake of the tragedy to protect and support family and friends of the victims. ""We will make sure the world is a better place because of our 49 angels,"" WKMG-TV quoted Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs as saying at the service before a performer sang ""Over the Rainbow"" to close the service as many on hand sobbed. ""Everybody's really come together,"" Matt Heavey, of Orlando, told WKMG. ""We kind of embraced differences,"" he said. ""We've embraced diversity that makes this city really go forward."" Many who came to pay respects said they were there for the first time since the shooting, with the tragedy still too raw. The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after the last call for drinks on the club's popular Latin night. He gunned down patrons on the dance floor and sprayed bullets at others cowering in bathroom stalls. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, Mateen claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before he was killed in an exchange of gunfire with authorities. His widow, Noor Salman, was arrested in January on federal charges of aiding and abetting Mateen's attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization, and lying to authorities investigating the massacre. She was not present for the attack and has pleaded not guilty. Along with the events in Orlando, vigils and rallies were planned across the United States in a show of solidarity with victims of the attack, which authorities called a hateful act against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. On social media, supporters sought to call attention to their legacy with a campaign using the tag #HonorThemWithAction. The Center, an LGBT advocacy group in Orlando, asked supporters to post photos of their events so survivors and the relatives of victims could see they had not been forgotten. ""A big part of the healing process is to see, 'I am not alone in this',"" said Terry DeCarlo, its executive director.

479,https://www.thedailybeast.com/planned-parenthood-smear-videos-caused-9-times-more-threats,"SEARCH There was a ninefold increase in threats against abortion providers after videos falsely accused doctors of selling ‘baby parts,’ the same phrase used by Robert Dear. The Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting was a shock but, sadly, not a surprise.  In the past four months, at least four separate groups have warned that the undercover video campaign from the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), which alleged that Planned Parenthood illegally profited from its fetal tissue donation program, could result in an escalation of violence against abortion providers. In a July 31 application (PDF) for an injunction against CMP founder David Daleiden and his organization, the National Abortion Federation (NAF) noted that there were already telling warning signs of anti-abortion violence, just 17 days after the release of the first undercover video. In addition to relaying death threats received by Planned Parenthood doctors, the NAF noted that their security staff had received “an increase in ‘off’ hour requests for security advice from its members” and that they had advised abortion providers to “be on heightened alert.” Most immediately concerning, however, was the NAF’s claim that “incidents of harassment at Planned Parenthood facilities increased nine fold in July, compared to reported incidents in June, and the reported incidents of harassment were even more numerous in August.” NAF President and CEO Vicki Saporta noted a “dramatic increase” in harassment since July 14, and recounted phone calls to clinics in which people made “threats [that] they are going to kill every doctor at the facility.” “Let’s pull a Columbine,” one caller allegedly said.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Saporta said, “In my 20 years at NAF, I have never seen such a volume, intensity, and escalation of hate speech, threats, and criminal activity, and we would like to prevent a serious violent act from occurring.” Law enforcement was also concerned about an increased risk of violence following the release of the CMP videos. In September, CBS reported that an FBI Intelligence Assessment warned that “it is likely criminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against reproductive health care providers, their staff, and facilities.” The document further noted that a recent uptick in criminal or suspicious incidents following the CMP videos was “consistent with the actions of lone offenders using tactics of arsons and threats all of which are typical of the pro-life extremist movement.” One of the nine incidents they listed was in Denver.Planned Parenthood itself has also warned about the effects the videos could have on a culture of anti-abortion extremism, despite the fact that the organization has been repeatedly cleared of allegations of criminal wrongdoing.On Nov. 10, a little over two weeks prior to the shooting, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told Katie Couric that vandalism had increased at affiliates around the country, making it challenging to recruit clinicians.“Given this current environment and the hostility that some of the extremists have and their willingness to kind of go to these depths to shame doctors, it’s very tough,” Richards said. Then there are the high-profile incidents themselves. There have been four arsons or attempted arsons at Planned Parenthood since July—a pattern that prompted anti-abortion terrorism expert David S. Cohen to tell the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch, “It’s scary to contemplate what might happen next.” Cohen was one of a group of 32 attorneys who signed a letter to California Attorney General Kamala Harris in July warning that the video campaign posed “a real threat to abortion provider safety.” “Given the unique risks that abortion providers face of being targeted by anti-abortion extremists, abortion providers whose images and names are blasted across the Internet in this fashion face grave threats to their and their family’s safety,” the letter read. After months of warning from multiple organizations, there has finally been a high-profile attack on an abortion provider that resulted in loss of life. On Nov. 27, Robert Lewis Dear entered the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs with “duffel bags full of rifles and handguns” and allegedly killed a police officer and two civilians. In the history of violence against abortion providers, this could be the first murder since the 2009 assassination of Dr. George Tiller and the closest event to “a Columbine” since 1994 when John Salvi fatally shot two receptionists in two different Massachusetts abortion clinics within minutes of each other. Until Dear goes to trial, it will be impossible to pinpoint the precise catalyst for the shooting and difficult to say if or how closely he was influenced by the CMP videos. Since the shooting, Cecile Richards has stopped short of attributing Dear’s alleged actions to current anti-abortion rhetoric while still warning of an “incredible escalation of harassment and intimidation” at abortion clinics.We can reasonably assume, however, that Dear had at least caught wind of the conversation around the CMP’s allegations against Planned Parenthood. Two law enforcement sources told NBC News that Dear said, “No more baby parts,” after being taken in for questioning. “Planned Parenthood Uses Partial-Birth Abortions to Sell Baby Parts” was the title of the first CMP video and #PPSellsBabyParts was the hashtag through which that video spread on social media. And on Tuesday, an anonymous source who had extensive conversations about religion with Dear told the The New York Times that the accused gunman described those who attacked abortion providers as doing “God’s work” and called the Christian terrorist organization Army of God, which has claimed responsibility for several bombings and abortion clinic attacks, “heroes.”Based on the Army of God website, the admiration appears to be somewhat mutual. Their description of the Colorado Springs shooting currently reads, “These murderous pigs at Planned Parenthood are babykillers [sic] and they reap what they sow. In this case, Planned Parenthood selling of aborted baby parts came back to bite them.” No matter Dear’s precise motive, his alleged act of violence at an abortion provider could prove to be the most extreme in decades. Based on NAF statistics, (PDF), Dear stands accused of killing as many people in seven hours in an abortion provider as have died from anti-abortion violence in the previous 20 years combined. And whatever led Dear to walk through the doors of the Colorado Springs clinic last Friday, the political climate following the Colorado Springs shooting is already eerily reminiscent of previous killings in anti-abortion history, with some of the most extreme voices on the right walking a fine and dangerous line in their response to the shooting.On Tuesday, RedState founder and conservative pundit Erick Erickson wrote, “It really is surprising more Planned Parenthood facilities and abortionists are not being targeted.” “Given the public light shed on the atrocities committed by Planned Parenthood and both the government and media’s turning a blind eye to it, dismissing it, laughing it off, or lying about it, it really should be surprising that Americans convicted of the need to stop the murder of children have not taken the law into their own hands,” he continued. But one development in the Colorado Springs shooting is troublingly different from past cycles of violence and rhetoric. As The New Yorker noted Tuesday, Dear does not fit the standard profile of previous anti-abortion killers, most of whom professed ties to groups like Operation Rescue, which is now funding the CMP, and Army of God. Pro-life leaders in Colorado Springs have said that they are not familiar with Dear and his online writings have yet to turn up any clear links to anti-abortion groups. And unlike past shootings, many of which clearly targeted specific doctors, Dear’s alleged actions—with the present limited information, at least—seem to have more in common with recent mass shootings at schools, churches, and other public venues than they do with anti-abortion assassinations.Dear’s case, then, could be a continuation of past violence at abortion providers but he could also prove to be something even more alarming: a new face of anti-abortion extremism in the age of the mass shooting.Either way, one of the most frightening things about Dear is just how many people seem to have seen him coming from so far away.",2017-06-26 17:55:58,Planned Parenthood Smear Videos Caused 9 Times More Threats,"abortion,medicine and health",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
