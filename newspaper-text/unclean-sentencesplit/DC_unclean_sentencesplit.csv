Rashbaum The woman who was shot to death after a taut, high-speed car chase through the streets between the White House and Capitol Hill was still in her car, snagged on the curb of a grass-covered median, when the police fired at her, a Senate official said on Friday.', 'Terrance W. Gainer, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, who was briefed on aspects of the episode, said the woman, Miriam Carey, was trying to make a U-turn between a United States Capitol Police security booth and some planters in the middle of the street on Constitution Avenue when Capitol Police officers and uniformed Secret Service officers shot at the car with semiautomatic pistols.', 'Ms. Carey, 34, was a dental hygienist who lived in Stamford, Conn. Law enforcement officials said on Friday that investigators found antipsychotic medications in her apartment, potential clues to her actions.', 'Friends and relatives, while portraying her as harmless, also recounted some bizarre behavior.', 'After collecting items from the Stamford apartment and interviewing friends and relatives, law enforcement authorities were still trying to understand what prompted her to drive to Washington and what she hoped to accomplish when she tried to force her way onto the White House grounds.', 'Questions were also being raised about whether she posed enough of a threat during the fast-moving sequence of events that the police needed to shoot her.', 'Initially, Ms. Carey was thought to have gotten out of the car when she was shot on Thursday afternoon.', 'Early accounts of such events are often inaccurate, however, and on Friday, new details emerged about the shooting and the woman who was killed.', 'Most police departments discourage or prohibit opening fire on vehicles.', 'With responsibility for safeguarding two of the county’s most significant landmarks, however, the Capitol Police and the Secret Service are particularly attuned to potential terrorist threats.', 'Car bombs are one concern, as evidenced by the restrictions on vehicles around the Capitol complex, and officials said that by remaining in the car, Ms. Carey might have heightened fears that the car was an explosive threat.', 'No firearms or explosives were found on her or in her car.', 'Investigators were looking into reports from her boyfriend that she had been delusional and believed that she was a prophet and under electronic surveillance by President Obama.', 'Another man who knew her, Majestic Steele, who is a neighbor of Ms. Carey’s mother, Idella Carey, said that a few years ago he saw Ms. Carey poised outside her mother’s Brooklyn apartment, clutching a Bible and wailing at the sky.', '“She was saying, ‘Help me’ and ‘I need you,’ and she was quoting Scripture,” Mr. Steele said.', '“The way she was speaking, it sounded like she was in trouble.” In an interview broadcast on Friday night on “Anderson Cooper 360°” on CNN, Amy Carey, one of her sisters, said, “I just know that my sister did experience postpartum depression with psychosis.” But she said her sister had received “treatment and medication and counseling,” and she added, “She didn’t appear to be unstable.” She and another sister, Valarie Carey, returned to Brooklyn on Friday night.', 'They and the family’s lawyer told a crowd of reporters that their sister had recently been weaned off of her medications, but seemed fine to them.', 'But, they said they felt that she had been unfairly maligned as unstable in news reports.', 'They also questioned why the Washington police had used deadly force.', '“Why was my sister shot and killed where her 1-year-old daughter was and she was unarmed?”said Valarie Carey, a former sergeant with the New York Police Department.', '“We deserve to know why.” Her sister had no delusions about meeting Mr. Obama, she added.', 'As depicted by law enforcement officials, witnesses and video of the chase, the final sequence played out as follows: Driving a black Infiniti with a young child believed to be her daughter in the back seat, Ms. Carey tried to barrel through a checkpoint outside the White House at 2:12 p.m. She hit an officer who tried to stop her and who rolled over the hood of her car.', 'She then raced down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol at speeds approaching 80 miles an hour, ignoring red lights and efforts by Secret Service officers to have her pull over.', 'When she seemed boxed in on the western side of the Capitol, officers converged on her with guns drawn.', 'She put her car in reverse and sped off.', 'In a video of the episode, gunshots can be heard as Ms. Carey raced away.', 'She hit a police car, then hurtled up Constitution Avenue.', 'There, at the security booth, she tried to make the U-turn, heading toward the officers.', 'They then opened fire.', 'The authorities would not estimate how many rounds were discharged.', 'Mr. Gainer, the sergeant-at-arms, said he believed that five to seven officers had fired.', 'One officer sustained injuries, which were not life-threatening.', 'The child was not hurt and is in protective custody.', 'Law enforcement experts outside of Washington said the shooting raised significant issues about the use of deadly force to stop Ms. Carey’s car as it traveled along one of the nation’s best-known routes, Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol.', 'The investigation into the shooting, which is being led by the Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, may focus on what threat the officers perceived Ms. Carey posed to them, the public and government facilities.', 'The episode occurred just weeks after a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard  and in the midst of a partial government shutdown.', 'Many police departments, including Washington’s, prohibit officers from firing at moving cars, even when the car is being used in a threatening manner.', 'The Metropolitan Police rules say that no officer shall discharge a firearm “at or from a moving vehicle unless deadly force is being used against the officer or another person,” and it notes, “For purposes of this order, a moving vehicle is not considered deadly force.” It is not clear whether the Secret Service or the Capitol Police have a similar policy.', '“The question should be, what was the threat that justified deadly force?” Geoffrey Alpert, a criminologist at the University of South Carolina, said.', '“Was there a way to keep her from getting involved in this incredibly dangerous chase?” He added: “She had to be stopped.', 'The question is, were there better ways to stop her?', 'I don’t know what the answers are.” Others who study law enforcement said the rules might legitimately be different for officials in Washington.', 'Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which recommends that police departments prohibit shooting at cars, said that constraint might not apply to the episode this week.', '“The White House and the U.S. Capitol are both considered high risk targets,” Mr. Wexler said.', '“The people who protect the White House and the people who protect the Capitol are not thinking about your everyday criminal.', 'They are thinking about a terrorist.” Mr. Gainer, a former chief of the Capitol Police, pointed out that Ms. Carey had tried to breach a barricade at the White House and had fled at a high rate of speed despite being ordered to stop.', 'Such behavior could raise the possibility of a car bomb.', '“They did the right thing,” Mr. Gainer said of the officers.', '“It’s not our typical car chase that starts out with some traffic stop.” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, defended the officers in a speech on the Senate floor on Friday.', 'He said the decision to shoot Ms. Carey was “understandable” because the Capitol and the White House were often targets of attacks.', 'Ms. Carey was one of five daughters who grew up in East New York, Brooklyn, where her mother and other relatives still live.', 'Her sister Franchette, who lives with her mother, said she had seen Ms. Carey during the week and noticed nothing unusual about her behavior.', 'Michael Brown, 33, a longtime friend, said he saw her on Tuesday evening.', 'He depicted her as generally friendly but not overly sociable.', 'It was not clear where she had been working recently.', 'Dr. Barry J. Weiss employed her at his periodontics practice in Hamden, Conn., for 15 months, before firing her in August 2012.', 'He said she had not been getting along with fellow employees.', '“When we confronted her about certain situations within the office, she had a temper,” Dr. Weiss said.', 'Ms. Carey did not appear to have any previous criminal history.', 'Advertisement']",2013-10-05 12:00:00,"Miriam Carey Was in Car When Police Fired, Official Says",,1,http://nytimes.com,DC

people at the Washington Navy Yard, Rick Warren and his wife, Kay, gave a lengthy interview to Piers Morgan on CNN.', 'Warren is perhaps the best-known clergyman in the country, the founder of the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif., and the author of the best-selling book, “The Purpose Driven Life.” Five months earlier, his son Matthew, who suffered from debilitating mental illness, had used a gun to commit suicide.', 'Matthew had tried for years to get ahold of a gun, his mother told Morgan, but he had never been able to obtain one legally.', 'That’s because California has laws preventing people with serious mental illness from buying a gun.', '“We’re grateful that the laws kept Matthew from getting the gun for as long as they did,” said Rick Warren.', 'But, after years of trying, Matthew finally found someone on the Internet who was willing to sell him a gun illegally.', 'He filed down the serial number so that the gun couldn’t be traced, and a month after taking possession of it, he killed himself.', 'Watching the interview, I couldn’t help but reflect on Alexis, who also had the kind of history — including an episode of hearing voices just five weeks earlier — that should have kept him from getting a gun.', 'In Virginia, however, he was able to legally purchase a Remington shotgun.', 'Remington is part of the Freedom Group, a company owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital.', 'Adam Lanza used a gun from the same company in the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn.', 'I was about to say that, once again, the intersection of mental illness and gun policy is top of mind.', 'But that’s not really true, is it?', 'What has been most stupefying about the reaction to the Navy Yard rampage is how muted it has been.', 'After the horror of Newtown, people were galvanized.', 'This time, the news seemed to be greeted with a resigned shrug.', '“Is this the new normal?” David Gregory asked Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association on Sunday on “Meet the Press” on NBC.', 'It’s sure starting to feel that way.', 'Mass shootings “ought to obsess us,” said President Obama when he spoke on Sunday to the grieving Navy Yard community.', '“It ought to lead to some sort of transformation.” But it never does.', 'We know that most mass shooters have this one thing in common: They have usually shown signs of mental illness in the past.', 'And while keeping guns out of their hands won’t put an end to gun violence, it might at least mitigate against these ritual slaughters of innocent people.', 'It wouldn’t even be that hard to accomplish.', '“You have to create a net that will weed out people who are likely to commit acts of gun violence,” says Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.', 'It would require universal background checks, for sure, with criteria built around past acts of violence, commitments to mental health facilities, and addiction to drugs and alcohol, among other things.', 'California, in fact, has such criteria, which is why Matthew Warren had such difficulty getting a gun.', '(You would also have to crack down on illegal gun sales.)', 'But it does require a political will that the country simply doesn’t have.', 'In recent months, it’s been the hard-line gun owners who’ve been galvanized in defeating an effort to institute national background checks in April, openly taking guns into Starbucks — forcing Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive, to issue a plea that they stop — and, most recently, successfully recalling two Colorado state legislators who had supported tougher gun laws.', 'After Newtown, Cerberus announced it would sell Freedom Group.', 'Nine months later, there has been no sale, and one wonders whether there ever will be.', '(A Cerberus spokesman said a sale was still the plan.)', 'When he spoke on Sunday, the president seemed to almost seethe with frustration.', 'But he also noted that the politics were “difficult.” And though he said that we should never view mass shootings as “the new normal,” he also made it clear that he won’t lead the charge.', 'There’s no political upside in trying to keep guns out of the wrong hands.', 'Earlier on Sunday, Senator Joe Manchin, the Democrat from West Virginia who had courageously led the effort for universal background checks back in April, was asked on “Face the Nation” on CBS if he were willing to give it another try.', '“I’m not going to go out there and just beat the drum for the sake of beating the drum,” he replied.', 'Meanwhile, we nervously await

Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University.', '“I get asked this a lot when there’s a horrible mass shooting and indications that the perpetrator had a mental health problem.', 'I can tell you the common characteristics of people who engage in mass shootings: It’s a picture of troubled, isolated young men that matches the picture of tens of thousands of other young men who will never do this.” Just last month, Mr. Alexis told the police in Rhode Island that he was hearing voices and was being followed by people who were bombarding him with vibrations.', 'Three violent incidents in the past decade led to run-ins with the police.', 'For its part, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it did not have anywhere near enough clues to ring alarm bells.', 'Mr. Alexis, 34, visited the emergency room at the V.A.', 'Medical Center in Providence, R.I., on Aug. 23, “complaining of insomnia,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday.', '“After a medical examination, he was given a small amount of medication to help him sleep and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider,” the statement said.', 'On Aug. 28, Mr. Alexis sought a medication refill at the emergency room of the V.A.', 'Medical Center in Washington.', 'There, he “attributed his insomnia to his work schedule,” the agency said in its statement.', '“He was given a small refill and was instructed to follow up with a primary care provider.', 'On both occasions, Mr. Alexis was alert and oriented, and was asked by V.A.', 'doctors if he was struggling with anxiety or depression, or had thoughts about harming himself or others, which he denied.” According to its records, the agency said, Mr. Alexis “never sought an appointment from a mental health specialist, and had previously either canceled or failed to show up for primary care appointments and claims evaluations examinations he had scheduled at V.A.', 'Medical Centers.” Even if he had kept the appointments, it is hard to say if he would have given doctors enough reasons to intervene.', 'Research shows that psychiatrists and psychologists do not do well at predicting violence.', 'Dr. Swanson described a study in which two groups of psychiatrists were asked to read the records of patients treated for mental health problems.', 'One group was told that the patients had committed murders or suicides, and the doctors were asked to comb over the records and look for warning signs or red flags that might have tipped off a therapist to the imminent threat.', 'A second group read the same records and was also asked to look for warning signs, but was not told about murders or suicides.', 'The group that knew things had ended badly was more likely to find danger signs in the records.', 'The second group, by and large, did not see much out of the ordinary.', 'Still other studies, Dr. Swanson said, have found that psychiatrists are good at predicting which patients will not commit acts of violence, but poor at recognizing those who will.', '“I wish I had better news,” Dr. Swanson said.', 'Rachel Yehuda, a professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who does research on post-traumatic stress disorder, said that tragedies might be averted if the police could immediately call in a mental health team when they encountered people like Mr. Alexis who claim to be hearing voices.', '“Wouldn’t it be great if there was a local outreach team that the police could call?” Dr. Yehuda said.', '“We know how to send an ambulance, but maybe we should have the equivalent of a mental health ambulance.” Dr. Yehuda agreed that predicting violence is a tough call, but she said that certain symptoms were a warning sign, including two that Mr. Alexis apparently exhibited: hearing voices and displaying uncontrollable anger.', 'The idea that Mr. Alexis had a blackout caused by anger was especially troubling, Dr. Yehuda said.', '“Uncontrollable rage should never be let go of without some kind of mental check-in,” Dr. Yehuda said.', '“That can really be a sign of unhinging.', 'You can’t tell if someone is hearing voices, but that kind of anger is often a warning sign.” It may mean, she added, that some source of distress in the person’s life is becoming too much to handle.', 'Dr. Michael Stone, a \xa0clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, said he had created a spreadsheet in which he analyzed 298 mass murderers.', 'Only about 22 percent were “flat-out psychotic,” he said, meaning both paranoid and delusional.', 'A few were profoundly depressed.', 'Many were angry, jealous or disgruntled workers who wanted to punish their bosses.', 'Dr. Stone took a hard line about how the authorities should have dealt with Mr. Alexis.', '“He had a history of violence before,” Dr. Stone said.', '“He slipped through the cracks because people gave him way more breaks than he deserved.', 'He told the police he was hearing voices.', 'The police are brain-dead.', 'They have no clue.', 'The police in this generation are much more lenient about letting psychotic people get away than when I was in training 50 years ago.” People thought to be dangerous can be involuntarily hospitalized if two psychiatrists sign documents to commit them, Dr. Stone said.', 'They cannot be held for very long, only a few days in most cases, but that is at least long enough to start psychotic patients on drugs that may ease their symptoms, he said.', 'Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and clinical professor\xa0of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, school of medicine, said that patients involuntarily committed were often released too soon.', '“The initial commitment is 72 hours, and often patients are released before

politics.', 'Another reason is that N.R.A.', 'and gun lobby scare tactics have been depressingly effective.', 'They raise the dander of one-issue voters to dazzling effect, and that leaves politicians groveling at their feet.', 'So rational discussion gets lost in the weeds of extreme rhetoric.', 'This is not an all-or-nothing battle.', 'But we must approach the issue and the facts with an open mind.', 'And we have to start with one point: the vast majority of gun owners are responsible, law-abiding citizens.', 'They own guns for protection, hunting, sports or even as collectors.', 'If most of these people weren’t responsible, there would be far more mass shootings than there are now.', 'The problem, rather, is that there are simply too many guns in this country to ever ensure that some portion will not fall into the hands of the criminally inclined or the violently insane.', 'Gun proliferation is a chicken that has come home to roost.', 'According to the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, there were an estimated 270 million civilian firearms in this country in 2011.', 'The country with the second highest number of weapons — 46 million — was India, which has nearly four times the population of America.', 'A November 2012 Congressional Research Service report put the estimate even higher, at approximately 310 million firearms “available to citizens.” That’s almost one gun to every man, woman and child in this country.', 'That leads to this idea of guns-as-protection, the idea that because criminals already have guns, law-abiding citizens need to have them too, just to even the playing field — or dare I say, killing field.', 'According to that March Pew report, protection has replaced hunting as the No.', '1 reason that people own guns.', 'The notion that the world is more dangerous than it used to be and you can be kept safe only with more guns is a linchpin of the N.R.A.', 'argument and a profit inflater for the gun industry.', 'As the N.R.A.’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, put it: “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.” The only problem is that the facts don’t neatly line up with that line of reasoning.', 'A June report from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council entitled “Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence” had some intriguing but not conclusive findings.', 'According to the report, there were about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008.', 'However, the estimated range of defensive uses of firearms ranged from 108,000 to more than three million.', 'Furthermore, the report pointed out that studies of the effectiveness of the defensive use of guns “have found consistently lower injury rates among gun using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies.” However, the study hastened to add: “Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public — concealed or open carry — may have a different net effect on the rate of injury.', 'For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use.” Furthermore, a study this month in the American Journal of Public Health found the following: “We observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates.', 'Although we could not determine causation, we found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides.” The ambiguity here points to a much larger problem: the dearth of serious scientific studies on gun violence.', 'A letter to the vice president and the Gun Violence Commission members, signed by more than 100 researchers from respected universities, pointed out that from 1973 to 2012, there were more than four million firearm injuries in America.', 'Meanwhile, the letter said, the National Institutes of Health granted only three major research awards to study the epidemic over that time.', 'By comparison, there were just 400 cases of cholera in America during that period, but the N.I.H.', 'awarded 212 major research awards to study the disease.', 'This is in part because Congress discourages serious study of this issue.', 'As the letter points out: “Subsection c of section 503 and 218 of FY2013 Appropriations Act governing NIH and CDC funding still contains the language: ‘None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control.’\xa0” We could get serious about this issue.', 'We could turn away from scaring people and toward scientific principles.', 'We could commit more money to more studies about the causes of and solutions to gun violence in this country, while sidestepping the talking-point spouters and the finger pointers and the profit makers.', 'But that would require courage and commitment, qualities that sadly run a deficit in Washington.', 'Advertisement']",2013-09-19 01:06:18,Op-Ed Columnist: A Ghastly Ritual Repeats Itself,,1,http://nytimes.com,DC

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a longtime proponent of assault-weapons bans whose effectiveness is questionable at best, announced that the killer was armed with a “military-style assault weapon” and asked, “When will enough be enough?” She argued for restricting sales of AR-15 rifles even though the shooter was not armed with that weapon.', 'Joining Feinstein in specifically denouncing the AR-15 was CNN host Piers Morgan, who said on his show that the Navy Yard installation had been “infiltrated by a man with a legally purchased AR-15, who just committed the same kind of atrocity as we saw at Sandy Hook and Aurora.” After learning that Aaron Alexis had in fact been unable to purchase such a weapon due to existing laws, Morgan tweeted, “Lots of confusion over exactly what guns Wash Navy Yard shooter used.', 'But do you think it matters to the victims?', '#GunControlNow” Feinstein’s and Morgan’s imprecise reactions suggest exactly why legislation shouldn’t be crafted, much less passed, in the heat of a crisis.', 'Whether it’s truly awful drug laws pushed in the wake of high-profile celebrity deaths, national-security measures rushed unread through Congress after the 9/11 attacks, or transformative bailouts to the banking and auto industries essentially cobbled together over a long weekend, laws should be the product of serious and dispassionate deliberation.', 'We feel with our hearts, yes, but we should govern with our minds.', 'Any calls for new gun legislation need to be squared with two long-term trends that are directly relevant to the unspeakable crime at the Navy Yard.', 'The first is that mass shootings are not increasing.', 'Northeastern University’s James Alan Fox, co-author of the 2011 book Extreme Killing, defines mass killings as those in which four or more people die and says there is no increase in such events in recent years.', 'As he told Bloomberg, “Our tendency is to go overboard and overreach in terms of trying to increase levels of security … [but] this is not an epidemic.” In the wake of the December 2012 Sandy Hook shooting, Mother Jones published a widely cited tally suggesting that mass shootings were in fact trending upward.', 'In an article for The Boston Globe, Fox criticizes Mother Jones for “exclud[ing] cases based on motive, location, and victim-offender relationship.” Despite shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Connecticut, “there has been no upward trend in mass shootings” wrote Fox, who provides an illuminating chart of incidents and casualties covering the years from 1976 to 2010.', '“What is abundantly clear from the full array of mass shootings, besides the lack of any trend upward or downward, is the largely random variability in the annual counts.” The second trend is a continuing decline in violent and gun-related crime, including murder.', 'Newly released FBI statistics show that 8,855 murders were committed using firearms in 2012 compared with 9,528 in 2008.', 'During the same five-year period, overall murders dropped from 14,224 in 2008 to 12,765 in 2012.', 'Over the past decade, “serious violent crime” (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) with weapons declined by 26 percent.', 'Such declines are of a piece with longer-term declines in violent crime rates.', 'In 1993, for instance, the violent crime rate per 100,000 people was 747.', 'In 2003, it was 476, and in 2012 it was 387.', 'Yet even if the continuing decline in violence in America means that new federal gun control legislation is a nonstarter, as House Minority Whip Rep.

station that a civilian defense contractor named Aaron Alexis had reported hearing voices coming from the floor and then the ceiling of his hotel room, while “some sort of microwave machine” bombarded him with “vibrations.” Alexis had told the Newport cops that he was a “naval contractor” who often traveled and had gotten into an argument with somebody as he got on a plane in Virginia.', 'Alexis said he believed that the person had three men “follow him and keep him awake by sending vibrations though his body” after he landed in Rhode Island.', 'He said he had not seen the trio but that they had begun speaking to him through a wall after he checked into a Residence Inn in Newport.', 'Alexis packed up and moved to a hotel at the Naval Station Newport, he told the cops, only for the voice to begin speaking through the floor and ceiling as well as the wall.', 'He had called the police for help after he moved to the Marriott and initially told the responding officers that the voices were coming through the floor.', 'He then said the voices were coming from the ceiling.', 'He told the cops about the “microwave machine” whose “vibrations” kept him from being able to sleep.', 'The officers put all this in a report, along with Alexis’s insistence that he “never felt anything like this and is worried these individuals are going to harm him.” Alexis had assured the officers that he had no mental illness in the family and had never suffered “any sort of mental episode.” The sergeant reviewed the report and reached for a phone.', '“Based on the Naval Base implications that the involved subject [Aaron Alexis] was hearing voices, I made contact with on duty Naval Station Police,” the sergeant later wrote.', 'The sergeant faxed the Naval Police a copy of the officers’ report.', '“[The Naval Police] advised me [they] would follow up and determine if he is in fact a naval base contractor,” the sergeant noted in an addendum.', 'A cursory check would have told the Naval Police that Alexis was indeed a computer technician with the defense subcontractor The Experts.', 'He had been detailed to work briefly in Newport before going on to the big Navy Yard in Washington.', 'A bit more checking might have shown that Alexis had been in the active Navy Reserve from 2007 to 2010.', 'He had apparently received an honorable discharge, though the Navy at one point had sought to make it a less desirable general discharge due to a “pattern of misbehavior” that included an arrest for recklessly discharging a firearm.', 'He had an earlier, pre-enlistment

psychiatric troubles often leave no public record.', 'Even so, it seems the Newport Police report alone should have been enough to raise red flags about a guy coming and going at secure military facilities, most particularly if there was even a hint that he had been known to express his anger with firearms.', 'As it was, Alexis was able to drive a rental car up to the gate at the Navy Yard in Washington on Monday morning, show his access card, and proceed on in.', 'He had with him a Remington 870 shotgun he purchased in a Virginia gun store on Sunday, a month after the Newport incident.', 'Authorities would later say he may have “gained access” to a Glock pistol belonging to one of his victims.', 'It is worth noting that he was known to own a Glock, which he had been allowed to retain after his firearm arrests did not result in convictions.', 'The 34-year-old man who proceeded to murder 12 people before being killed himself in a shootout with police had been known as a polite and quiet kid on the not-so-tough Queens streets where he grew up.', 'The worst thing a downstairs neighbor could say about him was that he once began bouncing a basketball inside too early in the morning.', 'She went up to ask him to stop and he did.', 'In an era when the police inaugurated a zero-tolerance policy for even minor infractions, Alexis’s only recorded encounter with law

2001, he became a clerk in the Administrative Computer Center at the Borough of Manhattan Community College across from the World Trade Center.', 'He was still employed there on 9/11, a no doubt impressionable 22-year-old.', 'The college says it has no knowledge of anything in particular he did that day or of any lasting psychological trauma he may have suffered beyond what was experienced by everybody.', 'Perhaps he and his family subsequently made a connection between the attack and his future troubles because after that his mental issues became more manifest.', 'He had moved to Seattle by 2004, when he first seems to have figured as a suspect in anything.', 'The police report says he stared silently at a construction worker across from his grandmother’s house over the course of 30

opportunity to replace Janet Napolitano.', 'Daniel Klaidman reports.', 'Can anyone fill Janet Napolitano’s shoes?', 'It’s been two months since the Homeland Security secretary announced her plans to resign, but the White House still isn’t close to settling on a replacement, according to administration officials familiar with the search.', 'At least two potential candidates have rebuffed their advances.', 'One of those is Michele Flournoy, a former deputy secretary of Defense who is deeply respected for both her policy and management skills.', ""It’s unclear why Flournoy wasn't interested in the position (she was traveling and did not respond to a request for comment) but one possibility is that Flournoy, who was among those in the running this year to replace Leon Panetta as Defense secretary, would rather wait out the possibility of getting the top Pentagon job—either later in the Obama administration or in a future Democratic administration."", 'The sources did not reveal the name of the second potential candidate, apart from saying it was an individual who has experience running a large organization.', 'At the same time, two names that have repeatedly been mentioned in media reports as top candidates have not been in the running at all, according to administration officials.', 'Thad Allen, a retired admiral and the ex-commandant of the Coast Guard, was assumed to be a likely candidate in part because of his widely praised response to Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill in 2010.', 'Allen is also said to be a skilled manager and has considerable bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.', 'But according to two administration officials, Allen has not been interviewed for the job.', 'Nor has John Pistole, the administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, a DHS sub-agency, who has quietly expressed interest in succeeding Napolitano, according to a senior administration official.', 'Pistole also served as deputy FBI director until 2010.', 'Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill and among former DHS officials, the delay in filling in the role is beginning to provoke some anxiety.', 'It’s not unusual for cabinet departments to have high-level vacancies as the White House searches for replacements, but there tends to be more apprehension when these vacancies involve security-related positions.', ""Since Napolitano's departure to become president of the University of California system, there have been numerous incidents that some say require the attention of a fully staffed Department of Homeland Security."", 'Among them: the Navy Yard mass shooting, the terrorist attack in Kenya, and the continuing fallout from the Syria crisis.', '""My worry is that it suggests the administration is doing a premature victory lap around al Qaeda, saying, in essence, ‘Who needs a secretary or even a deputy secretary?', 'Al Qaeda is on the run and we can kick back,’” says Stewart Baker, who served as assistant secretary for policy from 2005 until 2009.', '""That\'s the impression you get with their lackadaisical approach to filling the job.""', 'To be sure, the department’s acting secretary, Rand Beers, is a respected counterterrorism expert who has worked on the National Security staff of both Democratic and Republican administrations.', ""White House officials also say that President Obama and his advisers are conducting a methodical search to find a candidate who has the range of experiences to take on one of the federal government's most daunting leadership challenges."", 'The department has only been without a confirmed secretary since early this month, when Napolitano officially stepped down.', 'However, DHS has not had a permanent deputy secretary in place since the spring, when Jane Holl Lute resigned.', 'Obama has tapped Alejandro Mayorkas, a top DHS immigration official, to be the deputy homeland security chief, but the nomination has stalled amid an investigation into whether Mayorkas used undue influence top help a politically connected technology firm with securing visas.', '(Mayorkas has unequivocally denied the allegations.)', '""I\'m flabbergasted that the administration has allowed these vacancies to pile up,"" says one former high-ranking DHS official, who declined to be identified criticizing officials he continues to work with.', '""It\'s one thing for it to take a while during the first years of an administration, but in year five they ought to have a well-oiled machine.""', 'But administration defenders say the critics are neither being realistic about the challenges involved in finding confirmable candidates or about the real harm done by leaving positions open while a search is being conducted.', '""I know some think there are too many vacancies or people in acting positions, but the truth is, five years in, the folks who are there have substantial knowledge about the department\'s missions and the administration\'s priorities,"" says Sean Smith, a former DHS official and Napolitano spokesman.', '""It\'s a tough position to fill because of the breadth of the missions,"" adds Smith, noting that the department has law-enforcement, counterterrorism, immigration, cyber-security and disaster-relief responsibilities.', 'The apparent decision of Flournoy, in particular, points to another reality about the challenges of replacing Napolitano: Many potential candidates see little upside in the DHS job and much that could go wrong, potentially harming their professional trajectories.', 'Homeland Security is a sprawling agency that handles a vast array of pressing security and policy issues, including counterterrorism, immigration enforcement and cyber-security and disaster-relief.', 'The 240,000-employee department was cobbled together from 22 separate agencies in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and reports to no less than 100 different congressional committees and subcommittees.', 'While DHS has perhaps outgrown infancy, it is a long way from being a fully mature federal agency that fits smoothly into the wider federal government.', '""It\'s still in its terrible twos,"" is how one Obama administration official puts it.', ""Administration officials are looking for someone who has expertise in at least some of the department's missions, whether that is security, emergency management or disaster relief."", 'But they are also looking for someone who has a proven record managing a large, complicated bureaucracy.', 'And at the same time, entering their sixth year of an administration, the White House desperately wants someone who plays well with others.', 'After a first term in which President Obama seemed proud to assemble a ""team of rivals"" cabinet, his aides now tout internal ""chemistry"" and a smoothly running ""inter-agency"" as one of their most important goals.', ""That is especially important, they say, when Republicans in Congress remain so committed to blocking the president's agenda."", '""Our ships all have to be sailing in the same direction,"" says one White House official.', 'Many of the names that were floated soon after Napolitano announced her intention to step down, appear not to have gotten any traction.', ""Among them is New York City Policy Commissioner Ray Kelly, who will be out of a job when Mayor Michael Bloomberg's term ends later this year."", ""But Kelly carries baggage from what some view as overly aggressive police tactics, including his department's stop-and-frisk policy and its surveillance of Muslim communities."", 'Nevertheless, both President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have publicly touted Kelly in recent weeks.', 'Still, in Washington such high-profile praise is often interpreted as a consolation prize when the job is really going to someone else.', 'But to whom?', ""The White House apparently still doesn't know.""]",2013-09-25 05:45:00,The Job No One

the perfect opportunity at a rally in in Nebraska for crime victims, including 93-year-old Louise Sallowin, who was raped and beaten at her Omaha home this summer by a 19-year-old Mexican man who is in the U.S. illegally.', 'King made the claim that the number of Americans killed by illegal immigrants is “in multiples of the victims of September 11,” a figure he said he once heard from a former

believes it.', '“The collaborative, flexible, amorphously hierarchical American economy is shutting out ordinary men who were once the nation’s breadwinners in living-wage labor and manufacturing jobs,” Rubens wrote in his 2009 post.', '“Because status success is more vital to the male psychology, males are falling over the edge in increasing numbers.” This week he reiterated that point, arguing that “men are more sensitive than women to external indicators of status,” and, “if you look through individual psychology of mass shooters over the past 10 to 20 years, you can see that in the profile.', ""Often it's a person who has been subjected to extreme stress in the form of social rejection, job loss, and associated mental-health issues.” Rubens, who is actually a pretty moderate Republican and supports same-sex marriage and reproductive rights, did clarify that he is in favor of women in the workplace, noting that he’s business partners with his wife, a woman."", 'He simply

Martin Dempsey, said that they should.', 'General Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted that he had worked with retired Lt. Gen. Pete Chiarelli, the previous deputy commander of US forces in Iraq, who had done a great deal on exploring the causes for suicide within the armed forces, as well as with others “who believed that men and women should have the opportunity to overcome their mental health disorders or their mental challenges or their clinical challenges and shouldn’t be stigmatized.” “And so I remain in that camp,” he added, “that a man or a woman should have the ability to, with treatment, to overcome them and then to have a fruitful life and gain employment, including inside of the military.” Yet for this

tell you that you can’t be trusted, it doesn’t tell you that you may get violent.” There is evidence to suggest that those who seek mental health counseling may be healthier than those who do not, adds Ms. Tanielian.', '“That’s more likely to be a sign of someone who’s interested in bettering themselves and doing a good job,” she says.', 'The issue goes to the core question of how the Pentagon should view its responsibility to returning vets still dealing mentally with the after-effects of combat.', '“Do you keep them in the ranks and wrap your arms around them tightly, or do you push them out so that the military can focus on its job and let the VA take care of them?” says Phillip Carter, who directs the Military, Veterans, and Society program at the Center for a New American

September 17, 2013 As authorities investigate how and why the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard occurred, details about Aaron Alexis, the suspected gunman, are emerging that point to a man with a history of angry acts who was seeking help through Buddhism and mental health treatment.', 'Here are answers to five key questions about Mr. Alexis, given what is known about him so far.', '1.', 'What is Aaron Alexis’s history with the Navy?', 'Alexis was a full-time reservist in the US Navy from 2007 to 2011.', 'He received a general discharge in January 2011 after exhibiting a “pattern of misconduct,” according to officials, who declined to provide details of his misconduct.', 'While he served, Alexis did not have day-to-day contact with the Navy but was in the “ready reserve,” where he would be mobilized if called upon, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus told CNN.', 'After his release from the Navy, Alexis found work as a military subcontractor for The Experts, a group affiliated with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services that served the Navy’s Internet system, according to USA Today.', 'Through his work, Alexis had security clearance to access the navy yard.', '2.', 'What is his prior arrest record?', 'Is there a Sept. 11 connection?', 'Before his discharge from the Navy, Alexis was arrested at least twice for weapons violations.', 'In 2004, he was arrested in Seattle for shooting the right and left rear tires of another man’s car and firing a shot into the air with a .45-caliber pistol.', 'According to the Seattle\xa0police report, Alexis “stated that he perceived the victim had mocked him earlier that morning after he discovered his own vehicle had been tampered with.” That led to what Alexis ""described as a ‘black-out,’ fueled by anger,"" the report says.', '“He said he didn’t remember pulling the trigger of his firearm until about one-hour later.” Alexis also told police he was in New York City on 9/11 and was disturbed by the events.', 'The Seattle police report notes that Alexis’s father, living in New York at the time of his son’s arrest, called the police detective to say “that his son had experienced anger management problems that the family believed associated with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).', 'He confirmed that his son was an active participant in rescue attempts of September 11th, 2001.” Alexis, born in the borough of Queens in 1979, would have been 22 on 9/11.', 'Kristi Suthamtewakul, a friend from Fort Worth, Texas, told the Los Angeles Times that Alexis had “expressed anger about Sept. 11 to her, but that he was angry at terrorists.""', ""In the end, Seattle authorities didn't pursue the matter, because the police report never reached the city attorney."", '""We are not able to review for possible charges because the police report didn\'t make it to our office,"" spokeswoman Kimberly Mills told the Monitor.', 'Typically, this is a case that would have prompted charges.', '""It\'s very likely it would have been charged,"" she says.', '""I don\'t know where the disconnect was,"" she says, adding that the police report has a notation on it that it was sent to the Seattle municipal court.', ""Police can file traffic tickets directly with the court, but they can't file misdemeanor charges, like this one, to the court directly, she said."", 'They are supposed to send them to the city attorney first.', 'Alexis was also arrested in 2010 in Fort Worth, Texas, for discharging a gun in his apartment.', 'The bullet went through the floor and ceiling of his upstairs neighbor, who told police she felt threatened by Alexis, according to the Fort Worth police report viewed by The New York Times.', 'Alexis had confronted this neighbor in the parking lot about making too much noise, she told police.', 'The Forth Worth Police Department did not press charges after Alexis told them the gun accidently discharged as he was cleaning it while cooking.', 'The county criminal district attorney issued a statement Monday, saying “it was determined that the elements constituting recklessness under Texas law were not present and a case was not filed.” However, Alexis was asked to leave his Fort Worth apartment, and this incident in Texas played a role in his discharge from the Navy, according to a Navy official, speaking to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity.', '3.', 'Was Alexis receiving mental health treatment?', 'US law enforcement officials told the Associated Press that Alexis was dealing with mental health issues, including paranoia and a sleep disorder, and was hearing voices in his head.', 'The officials said Alexis had been treated by the Veterans Administration since August for mental health problems, but that the Navy had not declared him mentally unfit.', 'Alexis would have lost his security clearance if he had been given that classification.', 'Family members also told the Associated Press that Alexis was undergoing mental health treatment.', 'The officials spoke anonymously because of the ongoing criminal investigation.', 'Alexis was a heavy drinker, although his drinking was ""never a problem,"" Oui Suthamtewakul told The Washington Post.', 'In Texas, Alexis lived with Mr. Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi, in exchange for work at their Happy Bowl Thai restaurant in White Settlement.', 'Alexis also frequently played computer games, according to friends and associates.', 'While living with friends in Fort Worth, he kept three computers in his room and played games “at the nighttime and all day,” driving up the electrical bills, Naree Wilton, a cousin of Mr. Suthamtewakul, told the Los Angeles Times.', '4.', ""What were Alexis's interests in Buddhism and Thai culture?"", 'Pat Pundisto, a member of the Buddhist Temple Wat Busayadhammavanara in White Settlement, Texas, told The New York Times that Alexis dated a Thai woman and often attended Sunday services at the temple, where he intoned Buddhist chants and meditated afterward.', 'Ty Thairintr, a Forth Worth tooling design engineer who says he’s known Alexis for about five years, told the Los Angeles Times that Alexis planned on becoming a Buddhist monk.', '""He chanted better [in Thai] than me,"" he said.', '""He was a very devoted Buddhist,"" Mr. Thairintr\'s wife, Sasipa, told the Times.', '""Buddhism teaches forgiveness, not grudges.', 'That\'s why we\'re so shocked.""', '5.', 'Was Alexis unhappy about his Navy service?', 'According to some friends, Alexis was disgruntled with certain aspects of his military service.', 'Ms. Suthamtewakul told the Los Angeles Times there was ""nothing sinister about him,"" but that Alexis believed that Navy benefits had been withheld from him.', '“He just felt slighted by what he was getting each month,” Suthamtewakul said.', 'Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.', 'Mr. Thairintr said: ""He told me he believed he had superior abilities to his co-workers but he didn\'t get promoted.""', '""He complained about the rank and file not giving him respect” and felt discriminated against because he was black, Thairintr said.', 'Already a subscriber?', 'Login

it later was established that the shooter had once rented an AR-15, but was not in possession of it at the time of the shooting.', 'That pales in comparison to that evening’s show with Piers Morgan, who repeatedly insisted that the AR-15 had been used in the crime, arguing for a new assault-weapons ban because of it, and shouting down his guests when they attempted to disagree.', 'The next day, Morgan shifted his argument to this: “Lots of confusion over exactly what guns Wash Navy Yard shooter used.', 'But do you think it matters to the victims?” It mattered to Morgan the night before, and it matters to those pushing an assault-weapons ban, some of whom — Vice President Joe Biden among them — argue that people should buy shotguns instead of AR-15s for home protection.', 'Had Morgan waited to launch his latest jeremiad for gun control, perhaps he could have crafted an argument that actually fit the facts.', 'At least the mistakes made during the event were mainly not malicious.', 'That can’t be said for the demagoguery that followed much later at CNN.', 'Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.', 'All Rights Reserved.']",2013-09-18 16:41:13,Video: Stewart rips CNN for Navy Yard coverage,,117,http://hotair.com,DC

Washington Navy Yard in Washington.', '(AP) After a long, depressing day following the carnage at the Washington Navy Yard, I woke up yesterday to this Politico headline: “After shooting, talk turns to gun control.” “Gun Control Debate Reignited in Washington,” said an MSNBC headline.', 'That is the media’s default response after a mass shooting, and it’s an important debate to have.', 'But we already had it after the horror of Newtown, and it has become clear that Congress is not going to act on this issue.', 'The shooting spree by Aaron Alexis isn’t likely to change that, even though he killed 12 people literally in Capitol Hill’s backyard.', 'What’s more, CNN is now saying Alexis didn’t have an AR-15 assault rifle as had been widely reported, which muddles the picture even further.', 'In fact, as the New York Times reports, Alexis “test fired an AR-15 assault rifle at a Virginia gun store last week but was stopped from buying one because state law there prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.” So in this narrow instance, at least, existing gun control laws worked.', 'Yes, it’s amazing that a guy with his history of psychiatric problems, who once fired shots into his neighbor’s apartment to protest loud music, can get any kind of gun, let alone a contractor’s clearance into a military base.', 'But some of the stricter proposals, such as requiring background checks for gun show purchases, would not have prevented the massacre.', 'The other major proposal debated last winter, limiting high-capacity magazines that enable shooters to keep firing without reloading, never got a vote on the Hill, despite a major push by President Obama and Vice President Biden.', 'For many journalists, the gun control debate turned intensely personal after Newtown.', 'Many told me how they had cried over the elementary school assault and how it was finally time, after Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson and Aurora, to devote sustained attention to the issue of guns in our society.', 'In fact, Newtown so shocked the nation’s conscience that the coverage lasted for months, fueled in part by a major White House campaign that could not win over Congress.', 'Now the NRA’s clout was a major factor, but a majority of lawmakers, especially in the Republican-controlled House, simply don’t want to vote for tighter gun restrictions.', 'And the recent recall of two Colorado state lawmakers who voted for such restrictions underscores the volatility of the issue.', 'Alexis is said to have bought a shotgun in Virginia before the assault and to have grabbed one or more handguns from his victims.', 'CNN was among many news outlets, ranging from the New York Times and Washington Post and New York Daily News, which put a picture of the assault weapon on the cover, to the AP and Fox News, that said Monday he had used the AR-15 rifle.', 'But CNN said yesterday that, ""the sources, who have detailed knowledge of the investigation, cautioned that initial information that an AR-15 was used in the shootings may have been incorrect.', 'It is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday morning’s shootings.” And officials later confirmed at a briefing there was no evidence that Alexis brought an AR-15 to the Navy Yard.', 'The gun issue was muted in Monday’s coverage, but Piers Morgan, a gun control crusader, went off that evening with three pro-gun advocates.', '“We have this debate every time,"" the CNN host said.', '""I want the day to come when we don\'t have to have this ridiculous debate time and again in America.', ""AR-15, killing multiple Americans, I just cannot have this debate anymore and it's ridiculous!” If past is prologue, the gun debate will ricochet around the media for a week or so and then fade."", 'Without action by the administration, which failed to muster sufficient support after Newtown, there will be no news peg to keep the story going.', 'When the president addressed the shootings at a White House event Monday, as\xa0Politico’s piece put it,“Obama again hinted at his view that Congress must act to to help prevent future massacres, but offered no specifics and stopped short of promising a new White House campaign on that front.” While the Navy Yard aftermath drew plenty of coverage yesterday, there were plenty of other stories as well.', 'MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow called such mass shootings “a regular part of our news expectations.” That is undeniably sad.', 'And maybe I felt this one more profoundly because it happened not far from the neighborhood where I work, as opposed to, say, Fort Hood, Texas.', 'Maybe it’s easier for people to tune out and move on when killings take place on a military base, where only a fraction of the population works, than in a school or shopping center or movie theater.', 'The Navy Yard news is depressing, but it’s important for the media to stay on the story.', 'Wall Street Journal Hits Conservative GOP-ers as Suicidal You might expect the Wall Street Journal editorial page to be sympathetic to the most aggressive House conservatives.', 'These days, you would be wrong.', 'The conservative page has delivered a spanking to the Republican rebels who want to derail a budget deal with the White House, and in a disparaging tone that describes them as “kamikazes.” Now maybe said kamikazes will dismiss the editorial as the carping of the establishment.', 'But if you’re a Tea Party type and you’ve lost the Journal, you might want to think twice about your strategy.', 'The Journal says that Republicans can’t govern from the House, and can’t do anything unless they can get to 218 votes, which the dissidents are preventing John Boehner from doing in the budget talks.', 'And that, says the paper, “may let Mr. Obama outwit them like a domestic Vladimir Putin.” There is also a swipe at “pressure groups” like Heritage Action and the Club for Growth.', '“These critics portrayed the Boehner plan as a sellout because of a campaign that captured the imagination of some conservatives this summer: Republicans must threaten to crash their Zeros into the aircraft carrier of ObamaCare.', 'Their demand is that the House pair the ‘must pass’ CR or the debt limit with defunding the health-care bill.', 'Kamikaze missions rarely turn out well, least of all for the pilots.” Crash their Zeros into the aircraft carrier?', 'Ouch.', 'The editorial’s message reflects the MSM consensus that the backbenchers cannot achieve their goal.', '“If Republicans insist that any spending bill must defund ObamaCare, then a showdown is inevitable that shuts down much of the government.', 'Republicans will claim that Democrats are the ones shutting it down to preserve ObamaCare.', ""Voters may see it differently given the media's liberal sympathies and because the repeal-or-bust crowd provoked the confrontation.” The media’s sympathies have little to do with it."", 'This crowd\xa0is\xa0provoking a confrontation that their own House speaker doesn’t want and doesn’t think his side can win.', 'I’m not sure I’d go as far as the Journal’s conclusion

Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who sponsored the compromise background checks plan, said he wouldn’t bring it back up post-Navy Yard until he can get the support of five more senators.', 'Monday’s events left advocates calling for more action from the White House and Congress, with some arguing that the series of shootings was having a cumulative effect on the public even if the latest spree seemed unlikely to be as nationally searing as Sandy Hook.', '“I think the country and indeed the president have reached the tipping point not because of one mass shooting but because of an aggregate drip, drip, drip of more and more mass shootings,” said Mark Glaze of Mayors Against Illegal Guns — a group New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg formed to do battle with the National Rifle Association over the issue.', '“Every time this happens, it throws additional fuel on a fire already blazing pretty high.” Dan Gross of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said that if people thought Newtown itself would be so transformative that it would vault gun legislation into law, they were mistaken.', '( Also on POLITICO: Mark Kelly: ‘Gabby and I have been there’) “No one tragedy — no matter how horrible — is going to be enough to create the sustained public will that’s necessary to create change on this issue,” he said.', 'White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said during a briefing Monday afternoon that it was too soon to talk about specific legislative responses while the facts of what happened at the Navy Yard were still being sorted out.', '“It would be inappropriate to try to put in context something about which we have so few facts,” Carney said, while reiterating Obama’s support for “common-sense measures” to cut down on gun violence.', '“It is far too early to say anything about who did this and the broader meaning of it.” After the White House push for background checks died in the Senate in April, Vice President Joe Biden told religious and law enforcement groups that he and Obama would travel the country to stump for gun control measures.', 'But that effort never materialized and Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said this summer that the legislation would not come up again this year.', '( Also on POLITICO: Navy Yard shooting was in a very secure area) Gun control advocates said they hope the White House and the president won’t hesitate for long before diving back into the legislative battle.', '“I think it’s appropriate for the White House to wait until we know what happened, but at some point soon we will time to think hard about whether some senators who voted against what 90 percent of the public wants — expanded background checks — have some explaining to do,” Glaze said.', '“While this issue is so prominent and in front of the American public, it is an appropriate time to make another push,” Gross said.', '( Also on POLITICO: In tragedy’s wake, Obama finds tone a challenge) Gross noted that in the 1990s, the Brady Bill “took six votes, over seven years and three Congresses to pass.” Despite the recent spate of mass shootings, the public does not seem as exercised about the issue as it was in the 1990s when those incidents took place against a backdrop of widespread concern about violent crime.', 'Murder rates have dropped by more than half in many parts of the country.', '“From the 70s through the early 90s, the crime rate was going up steadily and the feeling was this is inexorable and is only going to get worse,” said Jim Kessler of the Democratic centrist group Third Way.', '“It was the top of mind issue.', 'Mike Dukakis arguably lost the presidential election on the basis of how he handled one, single criminal case.', 'That’d be unimaginable today.” Kessler, who’s been pushing what he calls “gun safety” legislation for more than two decades, said the fight is going to continue to be a hard one no matter what Obama does.', '“This is a slog,” Kessler said.', '“This is a very difficult Congress to get anything done on any subject…..You couldn’t ask the president to be a better friend on this, but he can’t get votes out of thin air.” The National Rifle Association did not respond to a request for comment, but one gun rights advocate who participated in White House meetings after Newtown said that if Obama aides press the same policy proposals they will suffer the same defeat.', '“What happened in April [in the Senate] was a triumph of politics trumping policy,” said former NRA lobbyist Richard Feldman, who now heads up the Independent Firearm Owners Association.', '“We had a big food fight, which was the quintessential sound and fury signifying nothing, instead of dealing with the problem.” Feldman faulted White House aides for leaping to push legislation on background checks, assault weapons and magazines, while doing little to address lapses in the mental health system that contribute to many mass shootings.', '“We should focus on policy and find the sweet spot on which Americans agree,” he said.', 'On Capitol Hill, a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on a gun-related issue — Stand Your Ground laws — scheduled for Tuesday morning was postponed.', 'A spokesman for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who was to chair the hearing, said it was put off “in light of today’s tragic shooting at the Navy Yard.” But members of Congress who’ve supported gun control legislation offered varying reactions to Monday’s violence, with some quickly bemoaning the legislative quagmire and others leaving the discussion for another day.', 'Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) began a written statement Monday evening on the attack by mourning the dead and extending her “thoughts and prayers,” but she did not shy away from painting the Navy Yard shooting as more evidence of the need for gun legislation.', '“This is one more event to add to the litany of massacres that occur when a deranged person or grievance killer is able to obtain multiple weapons—including a military-style assault rifle—and kill many people in a short amount of time,” Feinstein said.', '“When will enough be enough?” she asked.“Congress must stop shirking its responsibility and resume a thoughtful debate on gun violence in this country.', 'We must do more to stop this endless loss of life.” An aide to another gun control backer, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), said the senator had no comment now beyond a Tweet saying: “Holding my breath for those at the Navy Yard, praying for the victims and their families on this awful day in DC.” While some proponents of gun control measures kept quiet Monday, others did not shy from sparring with gun rights advocates on Twitter.', '“Incidents like the #NavyYardShooting will continue to occur with regularity until legislators stop allowing the #NRA to write gun policy,” the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence  tweeted.', 'Some gun rights supporters called the lobbying ill-timed as police vehicles raced through the streets of southeast Washington and doctors were providing updates on victims.', '“That’s a ridiculous argument,” responded the Coalition’s Ladd Everitt.', '“With the type of grotesque gun violence we see on a daily basis in our society, we can’t afford to not be talking about it every few minutes, much less trying to cherry pick the moments when it’s appropriate.” At the White House, a Monday night concert where Obama was to salute the legends of Latin music was called off.', 'One of the scheduled performers, Gloria Estefan, went on Twitter to note the cancellation.', '“Out of respect our show Musica Latina will not take place.', 'Prayers & peace!” she wrote.', 'Former Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser quickly chimed in with a dark observation on the frequency of mass shootings like the one Monday.', '“Sadly, gun violence got the rhythm,” Loeser tweeted.', '(He later deleted the tweet, saying he considered it to be “in bounds” but two other people “didn’t like it.”) Reid J.

EPSTEIN, GINGER GIBSON and KATIE GLUECK 09/16/2013 08:52 AM EDT Updated 09/17/2013 10:47 AM EDT Twelve people were killed Monday in a shooting attack at the Washington Navy Yard that also left a heavily armed gunman dead.', 'Authorities said the shooter has been identified as Aaron Alexis, 34, of Fort Worth, Texas.', '“We have no known motive at this stage,” D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray said at an afternoon press conference.', '“We don’t have any reason at this stage to suspect terrorism, but certainly it has not been ruled out.” For much of the day, police said they did not know if Alexis had acted alone, but in the evening, Chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department Cathy Lanier said they now believed he was the lone gunman.', 'Because of that, the extensive security measures in the area were eased.', '( PHOTOS: Shooting at Navy Yard) “We do now feel comfortable that we have the single and sole person responsible for the loss of life inside the base today,” Lanier said.', 'Reports said that the dead gunman had been dressed all in black and carrying three firearms, including a semi-automatic.', 'Hewlett-Packard subsequently confirmed that Alexis was employed by a subcontractor of the company.', 'Authorities said he used a valid pass to enter the base, and the Wall Street Journal reported that he had secret security clearance through his employer.', 'At an afternoon press conference, Lanier had said, “We potentially have two other shooters that we have not located at this point.” The department later announced it had identified one of them, who had been described as “a white male in the tan outfit,” and said that he is no longer “a suspect or person of interest.” At the time, she described the one remaining possible suspect as a black male wearing a “military-style” uniform and asked for help from the public to locate him.', '( VIDEO: Obama remarks on Navy Yard shooting) Gray confirmed that 13 people were dead, including the gunman, with several others badly wounded.', 'The FBI had now taken over the investigation, Lanier said.', 'Gray said that “as far as we know, this is an isolated incident.', '… We don’t know of any other installations that are involved in this.” On Capitol Hill, the Senate was locked down for part of the day as a result of the shooting, with no one allowed to enter or leave the Senate complex.', 'The move was out of an “abundance of caution,” said Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, explaining in a statement “we do not have any information to suggest the Senate, its members, or staff are in any danger.” Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) postponed scheduled votes, recessing for the day in light of the shooting.', '( WATCH: Breaking News: Shooting at Navy

throwing them over a White House fence was arrested, but several nearby blocks were shut down.', 'Pedestrians were still allowed through.', 'Three civilians, one metropolitan police officer, and one

who plans to hold a moment of silence Tuesday on the House floor in memory of those killed in the shooting.', '“We cannot know what happened yet, but I hope we will withhold judgment until we do.” ( Also on POLITICO: Pentagon tightening security after Navy Yard shooting) At the White House, President Barack Obama condemned the deadly attack as a “cowardly act,” vowing that federal and local law

semi-automatic rifle was used due to the “rapid succession” at which the patients heard the shots and that the center “will get bullet fragments and get more information.” Emergency personnel were on the scene and employees at the base had been told to “shelter in place” at the Navy Yard after the shooting began, according to the Navy.', 'Shots were first reported at 8:20 a.m. at the Naval Sea

from the fourth floor, added there was debate among employees whether to stay inside the cafeteria.', 'However, as more gun shots rang out, she said everyone ran out the side door in the cafeteria.',

floor of the building in a conference room when bullets came through the walls.', '“No one was hurt,” Vandroff said.', '“I’m afraid we did more damage to the furniture trying to barricade ourselves

Alexis in Fort Worth, Texas.', 'The FBI has identified Alexis, 34, as the gunman in the Monday, Sept. 16, 2013 shooting rampage at at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington that left thirteen dead, including himself.', '(AP Photo/Kristi Kinard Suthamtewakul)  Employees of the Washington Navy Yard line up to enter through a gate, many arriving to retrieve their vehicles, two days after a gunman killed twelve people and was killed himself inside the Navy Yard in Washington, on Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2013.', '(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)  WASHINGTON (AP) — Through a wall at his Rhode Island hotel, Aaron Alexis could hear them — voices harassing him, wanting to harm him.', 'He couldn’t sleep.', 'He believed people were following him, using a microwave machine to send vibrations to his body.', 'He changed hotels once, then again.', 'But he called police and told them he couldn’t get away from the voices.', 'On Aug. 7, police alerted officials at the Newport Naval Station about the naval defense contractor’s call.', 'But officers didn’t hear from him again.', 'By Aug. 25, Alexis had left the state.', 'The 34-year-old arrived in the Washington area, continuing his work as an information technology employee for a defense-related computer company.', 'Again, he spent nights in different hotels.', 'He suffered from serious mental problems, including paranoia and a sleep disorder, and was undergoing treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to the law enforcement officials.', 'But Alexis wasn’t stripped of his security clearance, and he kept working.', 'On Saturday, he visited Sharpshooters Small Arms Range in Lorton, Va., about 18 miles southwest of the nation’s capital.', 'He rented a rifle, bought bullets and took target practice at the 16-lane indoor range, then bought a shotgun and 24 shells, according to the store’s attorney.', 'Two days later, as the workweek dawned, Alexis entered the sprawling Washington Navy Yard, a 41-acre labyrinth of buildings protected by armed guards and metal detectors where employees must show IDs to get past doors and gates.', 'Authorities believe he drove a rental car there.', 'He was equipped with his pass for base access — and the shotgun.', 'Within minutes, it would create mayhem.', 'He stepped inside the massive Building 197, home to some 3,000 employees.', 'He opened fire around 8:15 a.m., raining shotgun blasts down from a fourth-floor overlook and third-floor hallway into a glass-walled cafeteria where employees were eating breakfast.', 'Trained tactical officers arrived, bursting through the building within seven minutes of the first 911 call, and Alexis shot at them, too.', 'Fire alarms blared, and officers had a hard time hearing one another.', 'A voice came on the overhead speaker telling workers to seek shelter — and later, to head for the gates at the complex.', 'A U.S. Park Police helicopter flew overhead, plucking a wounded woman from the roof with a rescue basket while a crew member armed with a rifle provided cover.', '“We have a report on the fourth floor, a male with a shotgun, multiple shots fired, multiple people down.', 'We’re still waiting for the OK that the scene has been secured,” an ambulance crew member says on emergency transmissions posted on Broadcastify.com, a source of live public safety audio feeds.', 'More dispatches followed: Shooter known to be in the main gate area.', 'Officer down on the third floor.', 'Female on the roof, shot in the shoulder.', 'Once inside, Alexis picked a handgun off an officer and, armed with two weapons, terrorized the building’s occupants.', 'He fired relentlessly not only at police who engaged him but at the workers inside: a 61-year-old marine engineer and grandfather who immigrated to the U.S. years ago from India, a Navy veteran and avid pilot who had once been stationed at Pearl Harbor, a die-hard Washington Redskins fan known for generous bear hugs.', 'A Washington police officer was shot multiple times in the legs but survived.', '“We just started running,” said Patricia Ward, who was in the cafeteria when the shooting began.', 'She said she heard three gunshots in a row, followed by several more.', 'Descriptions from witnesses and police paint a portrait of harrowing gun battles inside — all for more than half an hour.', 'The FBI, which launched a nationwide active shooter training program for local law enforcement after last December’s Connecticut elementary school massacre, says the average mass shooting is over within minutes and often ends once police arrive.', 'But this gun battle kept going.', 'As the chaos unraveled inside, police in the nation’s capital shut down the surrounding area.', 'Nearby schools went on lockdown, flights were halted at Reagan National Airport, and even after Alexis was mortally wounded by a police officer, officers chased leads that a second and possibly a third gunman had been working with him.', 'Twelve victims died — a body count that police say could have been much higher, even after they determined that the gunman had worked alone.', 'Eight were injured, with all expected to survive.', 'The Navy said several garages and all surface parking lots at the Washington Navy Yard would open Wednesday for employees to retrieve their private vehicles.', 'But the military installation would reopen for business for Mission Essential personnel only.', 'In a posting on its Facebook page, the Navy said the yard remains an active crime scene.', 'Access to Building 197, the site of Monday’s shooting, was prohibited.', 'More than 24 hours after the shooting, the motive remained a mystery.', 'U.S. law enforcement officials told The Associated Press that investigators had found no manifesto or other writings suggesting a political or religious motivation.', 'Ron Machen, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, ticked off some of the unanswered questions Tuesday.', '“What caused this individual to kill so many innocent men and women?', 'How did he carry out and plan this attack?', 'How did he get access to the weapons?', 'What could have been done to prevent this tragedy?', 'And most importantly, whether anyone else aided or assisted him either wittingly or unwittingly in this tragedy?” Machen added, “We’re not going to stop until we get answers to those questions.” ——

the stuff of nightmares and of fantasies; perhaps the most loved and most hated object in a country of plenty.', 'And, all told, that’s really quite silly.', 'So sure were the horrified darlings of the gun-control salon that an AR-15 had played a part in the abomination at Navy Yard that many felt compelled to insert one into the story, front and center.', 'At various points in the cycle, we were told that Aaron Alexis: took an AR-15 to the Navy Yard as his primary weapon; didn’t take one to the Navy Yard but stole one from a cop once inside; or didn’t use one at all, but tried to buy one in Virginia and was rebuffed by the law.', 'Eventually, it was made clear that the AR-15 had played no part at all in Monday’s events — but not until Piers Morgan had dedicated the better part of his show on Tuesday to railing against the weapon, Media Matters’s Eric Boehlert had gleefully written, “bottom line: another AR-15 mass shooting” on Twitter, and the New York Daily News’s Mike Lupica had rather embarrassingly dedicated a cover story to the weapon, which he characterized with typical hysteria as the “rifle for the ‘sport’ of hunting humans.” Wishcasting in public that a firearm you dislike has been used to murder people is not a good look.', 'Still, while the focus on the AR-15 is distressingly overblown, it is not entirely irrational, for at one level both its critics and its champions are motivated by the same thing.', 'The pro-gun side loves it because it is a commercially available, easy-to-use, well-built “tactical” weapon that looks like a “military style” machine gun; conversely, the other side hates it because it is a commercially available, easy-to-use, well-built “tactical” weapon that looks like a “military style” machine gun.', 'To its fans, it is the emblem of a liberty-obsessed people and a reminder that the citizenry is sovereign and may choose for itself how to manage its defense; to its critics, it is the sign of a liberty-obsessed people, and a reminder that the citizenry is sovereign and may choose for itself how to manage its defense.', 'In his novel Zero History, William Gibson hints at what I believe to be a truth about masculinity and firearms, describing the “traditional army-navy store” as containing “whole universes of wistful male fantasy.” Men do not wish to be soldiers, per se, Gibson notes, but on one level many do wish “to self-identify as” soldiers, “however secretly.” That is to say that they wish “to imagine they may be mistaken for, or at least associated with” soldiers.', 'Never mind, he argues, that “virtually none of [such a shop’s] products will ever be used for anything remotely like what they were designed for.” In my view, this soldierly instinct is a noble one, and it suits well a people that were explicitly not required or expected to give up their basic rights as a condition of entering the regnant social compact.', 'Insofar as the Second Amendment has to do with the militia at all, it exists primarily to codify and to protect the crucial space that exists between civil society and the force of government, and to entrench a citizen-led protection that was, Madison himself acknowledged in The Federalist papers, a last line of defense against a standing army.', 'The right to keep and bear arms, the Philadelphia Gazette confirmed in its 1791 explanation of the proposed Bill of Rights, is included to ensure that, if doing so became as tragically necessary as it had been for the Founders, the people could protect themselves against “civil rulers” who “may attempt to tyrannize” them and from “military forces” that “might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens.”  In almost every single case, it should be stressed, conservatives have no desire whatsoever actually to exercise this power.', 'But they nonetheless remain willing to do so if imperative, and they steadfastly refuse to be stripped of the means by which they might defend themselves.', 'This is to say that, to them, the concept of the “militia” is akin to the concept of calling citizens to perform jury service, as opposed to, say, having official and monopolistic professional judges.', 'As the existence of judges does not negate the need for juries, so the existence of the police and the military does not negate the need for a prepared citizenry.', 'This, as it happens, is precisely the same reason that the Left dislikes anything that smells of — or looks like — amateur militarism.', 'To progressives, the very idea of a citizenry that is armed so that it might protect itself is nothing short of a dangerous Red Dawn fantasy — a recipe for “anarchy” or “vigilantism,” and a serving of unlovely catnip to an “insurrectionist” movement (which never quite materializes but is always lurking).', 'For their part, progressives do not believe that it is constitutionally and philosophically irrational for the representatives of a free people to be able to disarm them, because History always moves forward and we have outgrown all that.', 'Instead, they believe that it is the job of the government to institute what it considers to be reasonable restrictions on weaponry in order to protect the people from themselves and from others.', 'In this view, only the police and the military should have “serious” weapons, and the people should submit to their protection.', 'Anything that even hints at military weaponry should, therefore, not be in the hands of the people.', 'And, quite deliberately, the AR-15 looks like a military weapon.', 'Nevertheless, one should never judge a firearm by its cover.', 'The AR-15 is not a military weapon, and the dogged insistence of ill-informed politicians and journalists that it is one renders them simultaneously comical, irritating, and ineffective.', 'For some reason, progressives remain proudly and profoundly ignorant on the subject of firearms, and consequently tend to mistake form for function.', 'Take a look down the lists of prohibited “assault weapons” that obtain in certain parts of the country and you will notice that they are almost exclusively populated by weapons that look, rather than are, scary, and that the variables that determine what is and is not legal are usually informed by features that are solely aesthetic.', 'And this is the thing: For all the hype, an AR-15 is really just a glorified .223 rifle.', 'It is not a “machine gun;” it is not “automatic”; it does not “spray bullets”; it is not a “weapon of war.” Indeed, it is not functionally any different from a host of other, similar, guns that are not black.', 'It is much, much less powerful than are almost all hunting rifles.', '(If you don’t believe me, try going hunting with one.)', 'The AR-15 is not a luxury item, either.', 'In fact, it is the most popular rifle in the country.', 'Why?', 'Because ammunition for it is easy to come by, because it is customizable at purchase, and because it is modular, which means that one can add and remove parts to suit one’s needs.', 'It is light enough for women to carry, but heavy enough to feel comfortable and steady in the hands of the average person.', 'And it is not especially powerful.', 'This, perhaps, is why it is used in so few crimes.', 'Rifles — not just AR-15s or other scary-looking long-guns, but all rifles — are used in under 3 percent of the gun deaths in the United States.', 'Indeed so rare is it that a rifle is used in the commission of a crime that the FBI reports that hands and fists are more than two times more likely to be used as murder weapons.', 'A savvy criminal wishing to do maximum damage in an enclosed space will not turn to an AR-15, but to a much more lethal (and intimidating) shotgun.', 'And this, of course, is exactly what Aaron Alexis, a Navy veteran, did to such lethal effect in Washington on Monday.', 'Ironically enough, the cosmetic additions with which the Left is obsessed and which the Right correctly dismisses as being immaterial to the weapon’s power probably help to explain why the AR-15 is used so rarely in the commission of crimes but used so frequently in mass-shootings.', 'Generally, mass-shooters seem to be living out some sort of fantasy: Perhaps this fantasy is based on the movies, in which the majority of heroes’ weapons look like AR-15s; perhaps this fantasy is based on a video game, in which black, modifiable guns predominate; perhaps this fantasy is based on warfare, in which the AR-15’s professional (automatic) siblings, the M4 and M16, are commonplace.', 'Whatever it is, the AR-15 looks like a fantasy gun — it is unsurprising that fantasists choose it.', 'Aesthetically, then, the obsession with the AR-15 is just about understandable.', 'But from the perspective of public policy, it is unforgivable.', 'It is a curiosity that each and every time that Barack Obama or Joe Biden have spoken in favor of expanded gun-control, they have assured the audience that they have no intention of touching sportsmen’s gear.', '“We recognize the traditions of gun ownership that passed on from generation to generation, that hunting and shooting are part of a cherished national heritage,” Obama told a crowd in New Orleans after the massacre in Aurora, Colo.', 'In Virginia in 2008, Joe Biden had put this more bluntly.', '“I guarantee you Barack Obama ain’t taking my shotguns,” Biden said.', '“So don’t buy that malarkey.” This, as ever, is welcome news.', 'And yet, given that shotguns are, both statistically and technically, significantly more dangerous than the AR-15, and that Aaron Alexis used a lethal Remington 870, the most commonly owned shotgun in the United States, one has to wonder why\xa0.', '.', '.', '— Charles C.

'And gun violence is what our gun-control laws should target.', 'Instead, our laws target lawful self-defense.', 'Gun violence is not a uniform plague.', 'According to the CDC, gun violence occurs most frequently in poorer areas where drugs are far too common and upward mobility and hope are desperately lacking.', 'The problem is that our federal laws focus on the broad issue, when the problem is narrow.', 'Sweeping, one-size-fits-all federal laws prohibit law-abiding citizens like Alexian Lien from defending themselves, instead of addressing the reality that gun violence is narrowly concentrated.', 'Once Alexian Lien stopped his car, he was surrounded and his tires slashed, while his wife frantically called the police pleading for help.', 'Had this been a city with concealed carry laws, perhaps the bikers would have had second thoughts about cornering a frightened family.', 'However, with Manhattan’s gun-control laws among the strictest in the country, New York City

percent were more concerned with encountering an armed victim than a law enforcement officer and 34 percent said they had been “scared off” by a victim with a firearm.', 'While I support each person’s right to self-defense, I also believe in selective gun-control.', 'The mass shootings at the Washington Navy Yard, the Aurora movie theater, the Newtown Connecticut school and at Virginia Tech were all perpetrated by those who were disturbed but not “mentally ill” enough to restrict them from buying a gun.', 'Since 1991, 100 percent of the non-terrorist, mass shooting involving more than 10 fatalities involved individuals with mental illness issues.', 'Removing guns from the mentally unstable should be a priority.', 'While most state laws prohibit the mentally unfit from owning guns, the unreasonably high standard requires an individual to be unable to distinguish fantasy from reality and/or be involuntarily committed to a mental institution.', 'As executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center states, “We’re protecting civil liberties at the expense of health and safety.” Our healthcare system has become reactionary rather than preventative, leaving our healthcare professionals more fearful of lawsuits than taking the initiative as our first line of defense.', 'The political alternative to creating reasonable restrictions on the mentally ill is to broadly eliminate the right to self-defense from the population at-large, a situation that is evident in cities across the U.S., such as Manhattan.', 'Some cities like Boston even require police registration of pepper spray.', 'Guns ownership demands personal responsibility, just like car ownership, and concealed carry permits should include similarly reasonable restrictions.', 'As new details emerge that an off-duty police officer may have taken part in the beating of Mr. Lien, while other bikers attempted to drag Mr. Lien’s wife from the car, a bystander, Sergio Consuegra, who is a father of 10, put his own safety at risk to stop the mob attack and summarized the situation best, saying, “At that moment I said, ‘Oh I gotta do something, there’s a family in danger here.', 'And they’re gonna get killed, nobody intervened in this situation and nobody stepping in.’” In the video, the gang doesn’t seem concerned about the victim fighting back or the police arriving and, not surprisingly, they

happened.', 'Mr. Lien’s case is a direct product of the failure of our gun laws, as well as the unwillingness of our politicians to address the weak link of our mental health system that leads to mass shootings.', 'Our gun control-oriented lawmakers need a reminder that our laws are supposed to be narrowly tailored to target gun criminals, and not the right of responsible citizens to defend

obsess us.', 'It ought to lead to some sort of transformation.', ""That's what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies."", 'In the United Kingdom, in Australia, when just a single mass shooting occurred in those countries, they understood that there was nothing ordinary about this kind of carnage.', 'They endured great heartbreak, but they also mobilized and they changed, and mass shootings became a great rarity.', 'And yet, here in the United States, after the round-of-clock coverage on cable news, after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches and all the punditry and all the commentary, nothing happens.', ""Alongside the anguish of these American families, alongside the accumulated outrage so many of us feel, sometimes I fear

in America is it's easy to get your hands on gun—and a lot of us know this."", 'But the politics are difficult, as we saw again this spring.', ""And that's sometimes where the resignation comes from—the sense that our politics are frozen and that nothing will change."", 'Well, I cannot accept that.', 'I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions,

men—who traditionally sport beards and turbans—are sometimes mistaken for fundamentalist Muslims hell-bent on America's distruction."", 'Which, they are not.', 'In the month after 9/11, more than 300 hate crimes were committed against Sikhs according to the Sikh Coalition, a New York-based community group formed in response to that flurry of misguided reprisal attacks.', 'The mass shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, last year was another disturbing example of the cultural confusion that the 700-year-old South Asian religion causes for some Americans.', 'Although Oak Creek authorities have yet to determine an official motive for the attack, the shooter’s white-supremacist background and alleged claims of an “impending racial war,” left little doubt that he targeted the Sikh community because of their differing cultural heritage.', 'Just last week, two incidents of mistaken xenophobia were reported: in Manhattan, a mob of 20 teenagers swarmed and beat a Columbia University professor, Prabhjot Singh, supposedly because his turban and beard signaled to the marauding teens that he was a terrorist.', 'Professor Singh’s attackers allegedly yelled, “Get Osama,” before they left Singh with a broken jaw and several missing teeth.', 'In Mississippi, a judge ordered a Sikh defendant to “remove the rag on his head” or go to jail.', 'The defendant had gotten arrested for carrying a short knife—or a kirpan—which, it turns out, is a religious requirement that some Sikh men follow.', 'The kirpan is a ceremonial dagger that some Sikh men carry as a symbol of the martial history of the religion and the duty of manhood.', 'Carrying the kirpan is one of the five articles of faith of Sikhism, as established in the 17th century by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth leader of the religion.', 'While advocates at the Sikh Coalition push for better education about their religion and nonviolent, cross-cultural outreach as a means to stop the uptick in violence toward Sikhs in the US, at least one American Sikh sees the legacy of the kirpan as a reason to arm up as a more direct method of deterrence.', 'Gursant Singh has a solution: he wants every Sikh man and woman to have access to and know how to use a firearm.', 'He details it on his\xa0YouTube channel and writes about his disenfranchisement with other white Sikhs in his book, Confessions of an American Sikh.', 'Gursant was born Clark Harris in 1956 to a proud military family in Southern California.', 'In 1981 he became one of thousands of white converts to Sikhism in American.', 'He is a uniquely American mix of red-blooded gun boosterism and the heritage of a religion birthed half a world away.', 'Get this: he sued the State of California because he claimed its ban on assualt assault weapons and high-capacity magazines interferes with the practice of his religion, claiming that the articles of faith detailing kirpan-carrying extend to the bearing of large firearms.', 'Gursant doesn’t speak for the majority of Sikhs in America.', 'The kirpan is regarded by many Sikhs as a potent symbol of duty for Sikh men and part of the muscular tradition of Sikh warriors, but few Sikhs connect that tradition to gun ownership.', 'We decided to talk with Gursant about his outlying beliefs that Sikhs should arm themselves, and how Sikhism might evolve in our pistol-popping, American context.', 'VICE: What is the place for guns in Sikhism?', 'Gursant Singh: Guru Gobind Singh said we should have weapons of all kinds.', 'We should be ready to defend ourselves and defend those who can’t defend themselves.', 'To train with firearms is good for your sense of confidence and responsibility.', 'I think it’s a great way to increase your self-confidence and individual responsibility.', 'I grew up with firearms so they’re very natural to me.', 'But I hear so many people who say they’re afraid of a gun.', '[laughs] It’s not the gun that is the thing to be afraid of.', 'It’s the people who are using them.', 'I think it’s important for our society to have the guns that these criminals have or that these hatemongers have.', 'I feel a lot safer and I feel self-confidence that I can go where I want and I don’t have to fear someone attacking me.', 'Are you always strapped then?', 'I just can’t imagine going out without wearing a handgun in today’s society.', 'You’re just really asking for trouble especially in our situation where there are so many people out there who hate us for looking Sikh.', ""It’s a personal defense weapon, and it's legal to get one."", 'You can defend yourself and your family without too much practice.', 'Take a few classes and get the license.', 'What are you currently packing?', 'For 35 years, I’ve always used a revolver.', 'I was convinced recently the more modern thing is a semiautomatic .45-caliber handgun.', 'It’s definitely more modern and effective.', 'Revolvers are really good; they’re easy to shoot.', 'You don’t have to worry about a safety because the hammer comes back.', 'They convinced me at the gun shop these semiautomatic weapons are very safe now.', 'Which was the major reason I didn’t get one before.', 'The .45 caliber is a much larger bullet it has a lot more impact and will knock someone down, while the .38 revolver doesn’t have as much impact.', 'With the revolver the cylinder has to turn when you pull the trigger so it’s not as accurate to shoot.', 'The main thing is you want to be trained with the handgun you use, so in the right situation you can act quickly.', 'These things happen very quickly.', 'So you think that the attack on the Columbia professor could have been deterred?', 'From what I saw, he [Prabhjot Singh] wasn’t wearing a kirpan, and I think that would’ve been a real deterrent.', 'It’s too bad.', 'I don’t think Sikhs should be victims.', 'I think there are enough teachings in Sikh history, like by Guru Gobind Singh, that we should be able to defend ourselves and defend those who can’t defend themselves.', 'That’s why, in my mind, we wear the kirpan so it’s not a showpiece.', 'It’s supposed to be a way to defend yourself.', 'It seems like the Sikh American community has a different idea.', 'I think most of the Sikhs coming from India to the USA are interested in making money and aren’t as interested in upholding the Sikh principles as Guru Gobind Singh laid them down.', 'You’ll see political advocacy groups like the Sikh Coalition, and they’ll never talk about firearms or self-defense.', 'They’re more interested in pacifism.', 'I think the stress on education is important, but education is not everything.', 'It’s definitely not going to help you in a one on one confrontation where someone has an agenda.', 'Try using education against someone like [Oak Creek Sikh Temple shooter] Michael Page.', 'How has the community reacted to your YouTube channel or calls to start a Sikh shooting club?', 'I have been kind of surprised by the lack of the interest.', 'I was just talking to my wife about the lack of interest.', 'There are so few Sikhs who would like to be, so-called orthodox Sikhs, or observant Sikhs about defending themselves.', 'I do see that there are a lot of Sikh youths between the ages of 16 and 25 who are getting back to the fundamentals of Guru Gobind Singh and the proficiency with self-defense.', 'I think there’s no substitute for guns.', 'If you’ve got a mob or a bunch of people who want to attack you, a gun is a good equalizer.', 'I think especially for women.', 'I encourage women to learn how to use a firearm.', 'And I think if all Sikhs had that weapon where they can legally have them, I don’t think people would mess around with them.', 'They would never attack a Sikh if they knew he had a gun.', 'That ‘s my opinion.', 'You’re from a military family.', 'Did you ever try to enlist?', 'I tried to get in the army in 1982, but I was denied basically for being Sikh and wearing a turban.', 'This was even though I’m from an important family—my dad was in the Marines for 14 years.', 'They’ve let three Sikhs in under an exemption they’ve been giving.', 'I think they’re medical doctors.', 'In 1948, President Truman had given an exemption for all Sikhs to join the army but in the 1980, the Moral Majority, they were a kind of right-wing Christian group, they had a lot of pressure on Ronald Reagan.', 'So they changed that exemption.', 'How did your white Christian parents react to your conversion to Sikhism?', 'My father didn’t like it at first, and he kicked me out of the house basically.', 'It took a few years to help him understand what Sikhs were about.', 'He had to read a few books and see that it’s not a cult or something.', 'But you’ve found a home in Yuba City?', 'The first Punjabi Sikh farmers came here in the turn of the 20th century.', 'The oldest gurdwara (Sikh temple) in the entire country is here.', 'So they’ve been Sikh farmers here for many, many generations.', 'If you drive down Yuba City you’ll see gurdwaras on the side of the road, there are many of them in Ffresno and Central Valley.', 'My experience is that Sikhs are really good hard-working people.', 'And they really have a good sense of values.', 'I married a Punjabi lady about five years ago.', 'And I’m really enjoying being in the family.', 'But you haven’t gotten much of a response regarding gun ownership?', 'I’ve talked to maybe six or seven people who have called me on the telephone.', 'I invite anyone to call me on the issue.', 'I’ve gotten likes on Facebook and a lot of responses and views on YouTube, but

public.', 'As you go about your business, shopping or merely enjoying the day, you happen to see someone with a rifle slung across their back.', 'He or she is not holding the rifle “at the ready,” and is going on about his or her business as if carrying nothing more innocuous than a beach towel.', 'It’s a crowded public place and no one else is carrying weapons.', 'Would this be suspicious?', 'Would you be afraid?', 'Would you call the police?', 'Chances are, the person openly carrying the rifle thinks you will and, in fact, wants you to call the police so he can be questioned and film it for the Internet.', 'Of the nine states whose constitutions specify that concealed carrying of firearms can be regulated, none explicitly forbid carrying the weapon openly.', 'Gun-rights advocates, usually also with a chip on their shoulder about police overreach, will open-carry knowing that they will eventually be stopped and questioned.', 'At least, that’s what happened in Appleton, Wisconsin on September 7, when two men were questioned then released when open-carrying at a downtown farmer’s market.', 'While they claim that they do this to “educate” both police and the public, I think it might be more than that.', 'As a veteran of the U.S. Army, I have been trained in the use of a number of weapons systems.', 'By far my favorite is the M-16/AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.', 'When deployed, it was my preferred weapon to carry.', 'The reason I wanted it with me in hazardous theaters was because it is a very efficient killing machine.', 'I never fired my weapon in combat, thankfully, but if I had needed to, it was the best weapon for the job.', 'That said, it’s also a really fun weapon to shoot on the range and, for those of us who like guns, it’s cool.', 'Yet, to civilians and those inexperienced with firearms, it can be a terrifying sight, and those who test the response of local police to open-carry situations know that.', 'This is why you could find hundreds of videos on sites like YouTube and LiveLeak featuring shaky camera footage of confrontations between gun owners and police officers, and usually not the best of either party.', 'Still, this is Opposing Views, so let’s examine both sides of the argument.', 'Police officers face a situation similar to the one faced by my fellow troops in Iraq.', 'They have to move about a community of people with no idea if any of them are an enemy and seek to do harm to the officer or others.', 'For the gun owners, they fear that a right they wish to exercise is, at best, being infringed upon or, at worst, being taken away bit by bit.', 'The police are, mostly, concerned about the safety of themselves and the community they serve, while the gun-rights advocates are concerned about their ability to defend themselves.', 'Both concerns are legitimate, although gun-rights advocates may be victims of a systematic approach by gun and ammunition manufacturers who have had record sales since President Obama’s election in 2008.', 'There was a massive media push, echoed by Republican spokespeople, that President Obama was an enemy of the second amendment, despite the fact that he expanded gun-rights during his first term and never publicly supported gun control legislation until after the mass-shooting at Sandy Hook elementary in December of 2012.', 'This is not to say that law-abiding gun owners don’t have any real concerns about police harassment.', 'An active-duty Sergeant in the US Army named C.J.', 'Grisham was hiking with his son for the Boy Scouts.', 'They were hiking in a rural area known for dangerous wildlife, so Grisham carried a pistol and a rifle.', 'They were recording the hike —\xa0as it is apparently Boy Scouts policy to document these hikes for merit badges —\xa0and a police officer stops the pair.', 'The police officer proceeds to grab the rifle from Grisham.', 'It was slung across his body, so it was attached to him, and Grisham reflexively took a step back.', 'The police officer draws his gun, pointing it at Grisham.', 'He then complies with his requests, but does so under protest.', 'You can see the video that was released below.', 'Given the officer’s attitude, plus the almost instinctive uneasiness a soldier has relinquishing his weapon to a stranger, Grisham’s actions don’t seem to warrant arrest or any charges.', 'According to his own personal blog, the case is likely to go to trial in late September.', 'Grisham has become internet-famous and appeared on a number of conservative media programs since the incident, but he is not a person who set out to find this fame in the support of an issue.', 'Three men in Texas were arrested on September 13, open-carrying rifles to a “planned event” outside of the Texas Capitol.', 'In the video below, Terry Holcomb—a Christian Pastor and board member of Texas Open Carry—gives an interview and is then followed by a group of people waiting to film his eventual arrest.', 'Texas does prevent carrying handguns openly, but there is an exception for antique guns or replicas.', 'Yet, he also came armed with cameras and printed-out copies of relevant laws.', 'Officer Jim Estes of the Albany Police Department was the subject of one of these “instructional” videos when a group of people with various YouTube channels met up to go on a walk, with Warren Drouin who runs the gun-rights-themed Markedguardian.', 'They are inevitably stopped and quested by Officer Estes who seemed to know immediately what was going on.', 'For the rest of the almost 15-minute video, Officer Estes patiently explains himself and his intentions, while the hosts nervously mumble questions to him.', 'They also express reticence to identify themselves to Officer Estes, despite the fact that their sole intention is to “educate the public” on the YouTube channels that bear their names.', 'It has somewhat baffled me since my discharge from the military, that anyone can go into a gun store, fill out the proper paperwork, and leave with a gun but perhaps without the knowledge of how to even load the thing.', 'Firearms are not excessively dangerous if the person wielding the firearm has extensively trained with it.', 'Things like muzzle discipline—ensuring that the barrel is not pointing at any person unless you mean it to be—and clearing the weapon become second-nature after a while.', 'You respect the machine; you don’t fear it.', 'So if education was the true goal of these guns-right’s advocates, I think that there are a number of much better strategies than walking around a neighborhood until enough people get nervous that there is a confrontation with police.', 'Instead of holding rallies, where armed people mill about carrying weapons like they’re handbags, perhaps they could take a more open and informative approach.', 'They could consider those who are afraid of guns, explaining their point of view with patience and not condescension.', 'For the police, perhaps they could take a more agreeable tone, instead of seeming gobsmacked every time one of them suggests that openly-carrying a formidable weapon would be a cause for alarm.', 'It’s disingenuous and surely makes every officer run through a mental list of folks they know who’ve been shot while on the job.', 'Americans have the right to free expression, a right so important that it is the first amendment included by the Anti-Federalists in the compromise that gave us our Constitution.', 'However, if a citizen wanted to stand in the middle of a public park and express himself by shouting vile expletives or mean-spirited rhetoric, the police could remove the citizen under the “catch-all” charge of “disorderly conduct.” While there are legitimate concerns to the abuse of disorderly conduct by the police, it seems to me that the better gamble for them to avail themselves of that charge if they can’t ascertain the intent of the armed citizen.', 'If it’s just to educate, perhaps they should be more free with relevant information.', 'As details about the tragic mass-shooting in Washington D.C. continue to be revealed, it’s inevitable that the national conversation will again focus on the debate versus gun control and the free exercise of second-amendment rights.', 'Given the rising frequency of mass-shootings in the past few decades, many blame the easy access to guns in America, while others blame the media’s response to these events.', 'Still, for those who wish to advocate for gun-rights, especially in the aftermath of these emotional and frightening events, perhaps it is best to take a softer approach.', 'Otherwise, the advocate is just another angry person holding a firearm, which will ultimately hurt the cause.', 'undefined']",2013-09-17 15:58:34,"""Am

your guns away,” now, as President of the United States in 2013, has embraced the universal firearm confiscation of Australia and England—schemes that saw the destruction of hundreds of thousands of registered, legal firearms that had been outlawed and taken under threat of force from licensed gun owners by their governments.', 'Obama revealed his gun control endgame in a Sept. 22, 2013, political speech at a solemn memorial for the 12 Washington Navy Yard victims murdered by a deranged killer on Sept. 16, 2013.', 'Obama coldly used the madness of a delusional lone mass-murderer to claim that the rampage “ought to lead to some sort of transformation … it ought to obsess us.” In the same breath, Obama defined his personal “obsession” and his notion of “transformation” for ordinary American gun owners: “That’s what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies.', 'In the United Kingdom, in Australia … they mobilized and they changed.” The Washington Post\xa0praised Obama’s demand for “transformation” to an Australia-style gun roundup and destruction as “commonsense.” While the U.S. media either ignored or glossed over Obama’s embrace of the Aussie model for gun bans, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Sept. 23, 2013, led its coverage with this: “The U.S. president, Barack Obama, says it’s time for America to follow the example of countries like Australia when it comes to gun control.” With a Sept. 23, 2013, headline, “Obama hails Australian gun laws,” Sky News led its coverage with: “President Barack Obama has used Australia as a positive example of a country that tightened gun laws after a mass shooting.” Virtually no U.S. media outlet was honest enough to describe what actually happened to our formerly free English speaking cousins as a direct result of mass murders committed by lone, criminally insane killers.', 'In reaction to the murder of 16 people in Hungerford in 1987 by an insane killer, registered semi-automatic rifles in Great Britain were banned and confiscated from all licensed owners.', 'Then, following the 1996 massacre of school children in Dunblane, Scotland, most registered handguns were declared contraband, taken and destroyed.', 'Owners of .22-cal.', 'handguns had been allowed to keep them at government approved facilities, but they, too, were outlawed, collected and

its owner and his wife, slaughtered 34 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania.', 'As a result, all semi-automatic rifles, including .22s, and all semi-automatic shotguns and pump shotguns were banned, and licensed owners were required to turn them in for destruction under what the government, as in England, called a “buyback.” In reality, the “buybacks” were theft—made possible by using pre-existing government lists of licensed owners and registered guns.', 'All of this explains Obama’s obsessive call for “universal background checks”—a scheme easily morphed into gun-owner registration.', 'The president’s notion of crafting a U.S. version of the Australian/British tyranny has not come in a vacuum.', 'It has been preceded by a spate of articles designed to introduce the public to the concept.', 'Key to this propaganda push was a Jan. 16, 2013,\xa0New York Times\xa0op-ed by former Aussie Prime Minister John Howard, titled “I Went After Guns.', 'Obama Can, Too.” In it, Howard touted his politics of forcibly disarming licensed law-abiding Australians: “City dwellers supported our plan, but there was strong resistance by some in rural Australia.', 'Many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives.', 'Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair.', 'Many of them … felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws.', 'I understood their misgivings.', 'Yet I felt there was no alternative.” And Howard boasted, “Almost 700,000 guns were bought back and destroyed—the equivalent of 40 million guns in the United States.”\xa0(Emphasis added) Understand that Australia is perhaps the most urbanized nation in the world where coastal, non-gun-owning city dwellers dwarf rural populations who have a long firearm tradition.', 'But today it is those urbanites in places like Sydney who are reaping the real consequences of John Howard’s multiple “buybacks.” Criminal violence with illegal firearms in those urban centers is soaring.', 'Try these headlines from one month before the U.S. Washington Navy Yard murders: From the\xa0Ballina Shire Advocate, Aug. 21, 2013, “New plan unveiled to tackle out-of-control gun violence.” Or this from News Limited Network Aug. 2, 2013, “Is Australia staring down the barrel of a gun crisis?” “There is a gun battle going on in Australia.', 'As bike gang members and drug dealers gun each other down on a regular basis, sending fear through the community, authorities seem to be fighting a losing battle to keep firearms out of their hands.” As for mass murders, Howard, who once summed up his optic on freedom saying, “I hate guns,” wrote in his\xa0New York Times\xa0op-ed: “The fundamental problem was the ready availability of high-powered weapons, which enabled people to convert their murderous impulses into mass killing.” “People?” Ordinary citizens?', 'The confiscatory bans were a hysterical response to the insanity of one person.',

developed for first responders like firefighters and police officers.', 'They would witness something terrible, then gather and discuss their feelings.', 'The early evidence suggested that these men and women who shared an intense bond felt less alone.', 'It made sense then to apply the same principle to other groups that had endured disasters.', 'But these individuals were sometimes strangers,

reduce stress or anxiety."", 'It may even have made symptoms worse.', '""Out of frustration,"" Tuma says, ""different parts of the mental health community started to ask, ‘What could we do?\'""', 'It may even have made symptoms worse What they did was devise ""a recipe book"" of eight components essential to PFA.', 'These include calming survivors, offering practical assistance, and providing information on coping skills.', 'There are no therapy sessions or group discussions.', 'Valerie Cole, manager of disaster health and mental health services for the Red Cross, says their clinicians and

the difficulty of conducting a study in the wake of a mass shooting or hurricane.', 'By nature, these events are unpredictable and unleash chaos.', 'Even if a study could be deployed, there are ethical concerns about recruiting participants and diverting resources from disaster response.', 'McCart believes his project avoids these complications.', 'At the end of the month, advocates in the

faces.', 'So intent is the town on suppressing attention that officials are urging businesses, churches and institutions to not let TV vans use their parking lots.', 'The police will also be on the lookout for any such vans parked along the winding roads outside of town.', 'The town will not mark the anniversary of the shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, which occurred on Dec. 14, 2012, with a public remembrance.', 'Schools or houses of worship may mark the day with speeches or prayers for the 20 first graders and six adults who were killed, but there will be no globally broadcast roll call of names, no playing of bagpipes, no honor guards.', '“All of these children, they need a chance to be happy,” said Maria Ruggiero, an employee at the Village Perk Cafe, speaking of the town’s children.', '“This constant reminder of sadness, it needs to stop.', 'That’s why we want the media to stay away.” Normally, the first anniversary of such a tragedy would draw hordes of journalists, as happened with the mass killings at Aurora, Colo., and Virginia Tech.', 'And each year since the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, there has been extensive, live coverage by the news media as the names of the dead are read at a solemn ceremony in downtown Manhattan.', 'But at least two TV networks — NBC and ABC — say they have no plans to dispatch fully equipped crews through Newtown that day.', 'One TV executive said that parents had urged his network to stay away because children were still suffering from anxiety, and the sight of TV vans triggered reminders of the shootings.', '“NBC News is respecting the town’s wishes and our broadcasts have no plans to be in Newtown for the anniversary,” said Erika Masonhall, a spokeswoman for the network.', 'CBS News plans to be there, though it has already been turned down for some spots to park trucks.', '“Our goal is to have the smallest footprint possible,” said Tim Gaughan, director of special events for CBS News.', '“We don’t want to be intrusive, but we’re confident we can report the story and not get in the way.” Beyond the desire for keeping their grief private, the town’s business owners are concerned about their economic well-being.', 'Last December, media vehicles clogged streets, making it difficult to get to shops during the important Christmas season.', '“Even the places you could get to, you didn’t want to because you’d have a microphone or TV camera in your face,” said Jim Morely, a board member of Newtown Savings Bank.', 'Patricia Llodra, Newtown’s first selectman, equivalent to a mayor, said she had unanimous support for lowering the day’s temperature.', 'In a town of 28,000 people, she said, almost everybody is regularly reminded of the lost children and teachers by the faces and places they see.', '“The difference with 9/11 is that it happened in a city of millions of people,” said Ms. Llodra, who was at the firehouse when parents were told one by one that their children had been killed.', '“It is possible to have a life in New York without continual reminders — for us, we live this tragedy every day.” “We need our own time to heal,” she added.', '“We’re in this journey of recovery, 28,000 of us.” The town could not help but be reminded last month when the Connecticut state’s attorney in Danbury released a 48-page report that

Wednesday, recordings of the calls to 911 from inside the school were released.', 'The townspeople say they do not want to be forever defined by tragedy.', '“We’re not victims,” Ms. Llodra said.',

door, opened fire on the principal, staff members and two classrooms of first graders before shooting himself with a handgun.', 'The town made it virtually impossible to take mementos from the building’s remains — it had the structural steel melted — or to photograph it close up.', 'The news media could only fly overhead in helicopters as the school was razed.', 'One singularly affected group, the parents of the 12 children who were in the invaded classrooms but survived, will no longer speak to reporters, though two confided to The Associated Press in September about the nightmares, anxiety and curiosity about perished classmates that their children still experienced.', 'Parents of the slain children as well as unnerved neighbors — “it struck everyone with such intimacy,” said John Woodall, a local psychiatrist — continue to devote themselves to philanthropic projects and advocacy that reflect themes that were dear to their children or were a motif in the tragedy.', 'Thirteen sets of parents have started memorial foundations to raise money for art instruction, mental health research, physical fitness, horseback riding lessons, even lessons in compassion, according to Sharon Cohen, a local writer who has compiled a book about the projects.', 'With Joey’s Fund, Michele Gay raised $200,000 for families with autistic children like her 7-year-old, Josephine, a girl who loved Barbie dolls, swinging with her sisters, and the color purple.', 'And Ms.', 'Gay worked with another parent, Alissa Parker, whose daughter Emilie was also killed, to help

Mark Barden started “What Would Daniel Do?” to promote what he calls acts of kindness.', 'Daniel, his son, was a child who would pick a worm up from the driveway and return it to the grass, Mr. Barden said, or help a classmate with a stuck jacket zipper.', '“We’re not going to have his presence in our life so we’re going to do what we can do to do the things he would have done,” he said.', 'Townspeople who did not lose a family member have also channeled their emotions into action.', 'Po Murray, who lived 50 yards from the killer’s house, has met Congressional representatives to push for laws to deter gun violence.', 'Last March, Monte Frank, a lawyer, and two dozen cyclists rode 375 miles to Washington for the same cause.', 'The families of victims support the decision to observe

afternoon, that great mix of friends formed a circle around the car, holding hands as they prayed.', 'They then prepared to release three dozen balloons, grey and blue, the colors of their school.',

outdoor shooting range maintained by the U.S. National Park Service.', 'The killer had practiced his marksmanship there, firing with the same methodical deliberation that would be recalled by the survivors.', 'He is also believed to have filmed in the parking lot some of the images of himself he later sent to NBC.', 'Among the shooters at the range two days after the massacre were two Virginia Tech students.', 'They were blazing away with a Glock-9, the same kind of gun the killer had used to such devastating effect.', '“They should only give these to responsible people,” said one of the students, David Whitlow.', 'In a kind of manifesto, the Virginia Tech killer had written about the two Columbine killers.', 'All three killers were studied by the twisted 20-year-old who would do the unimaginable at Sandy Hook, taking us from wondering when will the killing ever end to how could it have possibly have gotten to this?', 'The Sandy Hook killer was also a fan of Glocks.', 'He

registered and have been cleared by the site administrator are you able to view postings such as the one in which the Sandy Hook killer once spoke of his Glock “fetish.” But the Sandy Hook killer’s main weapon proved to be a Bushmaster .223 rifle.', 'He fired 154 rounds with it in less than 11 minutes, killing a total of 26 people.', 'He almost certainly would have killed more kids were it not for the bravery of Jesse Lewis.', 'Eleven months after the shooting, the Connecticut State Police released its report.', 'I noted that among many other things a search of the killer’s room produced were “materials regarding the topic of pedophilia and advocating for rights for pedophiles.” I have always felt there was a sexual component to what the Sandy Hook killer himself termed a “fetish” over guns.', 'I suddenly wondered if this explained why the killer had gone after kids, especially since the state police report maintained that he did not seem to have been bullied when he was a student at Sandy Hook.', 'After I wrote a piece suggesting that the Sandy Hook killer may have been acting out of some kind of homicidal pedophilia I got a call from a woman who said she represented the families of the murdered children.', 'She informed me that the families had been greatly distressed and offended by the article, which she described as the single worst piece they had read.', 'The

Kennedy's assassination on the 50th anniversary of that event have reminded us that this form of confusion predated the Internet and cable news."", 'But today the news cycle has sped up, ravenously seeking new fodder in a matter of days rather than weeks.', 'By the time more responsible investigators have nailed down the facts, the public is often no longer paying attention.', 'For this reason, there\'s more call than ever for books like Matthew Lysiak\'s ""Newtown: An American Tragedy.""', 'Lysiak, a reporter for the New York Daily News, covered the story of the mass shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a year ago on Saturday.', 'At the time, the press misidentified the murderer, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, as his older brother, Ryan.', ""(Adam was carrying Ryan's ID when he shot himself at the end of his rampage.)"", ""There were reports that Lanza's mother, Nancy, worked at the school and was killed during the shooting."", '(Her son shot her three times in the head that morning as she lay in bed, then left the house for Sandy Hook.)', 'And there was talk of a second shooter -- actually a parent, apprehended then cleared by law enforcement officials when they arrived at the scene.', 'Depending on when you checked out of the coverage, you might be harboring all sorts of erroneous ideas about the tragedy.', '""Newtown"" is a just-the-facts narrative, and Lysiak is no prose stylist; he has an unfortunate propensity for clichés and dangling participles.', 'But this book shows a deeper grasp of how to assemble those facts into a meaningful picture of events, and it is tremendously moving in the simplicity of its presentation.', ""Lysiak balances perfectly the ordinarily wondrous lives of the 20 children and six women who were murdered against their killer's depravity."", 'Lysiak is a master of texture, at selecting precise, individualizing details: the first-grader who asked her mother for extra tissue paper to wrap the gingerbread house she planned to make at school that day, the way Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung sometimes snuck her paperwork with her into the stands when attending school athletic events, the ""plush blue shark"" slipped into one small coffin.', ""Lysiak's account of the shooting itself, which lasted about five minutes, and the events leading up to and following it are tersely horrific."", ""The slaughter of so many innocents makes Sandy Hook one of the darkest nightmares in the ever-growing list of America's lone-gunman sprees, but it does have a heartening counterpoint in the selfless courage of the women who died that December morning trying to protect their charges."", ""Hochsprung gave her life to warn her colleagues of the danger, first-grade teacher Victoria Soto stepped between Lanza and her students, and when teacher's aide Anne Marie Murphy could not hide 6-year-old Dylan Hockley from the murderer, she wrapped her body around his in an attempt to shield him."", ""Within a day or two of this atrocity, everyone was arguing about its cause and significance, and these debates become part of Lysiak's narrative as well, though not to the point of overwhelming the story of Newtown and its citizens."", ""The loudest rhetorical clashes occurred between gun control advocates and Second Amendment absolutists like the firearms-industry-funded NRA, but other debates raged as well: over the import of Lanza's diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome and whether reporting this was prejudicial to people with autism, as well as Lanza's obsession with video games."", ""Interest groups fearing stigma or regulatory crackdowns sought to deflect fault elsewhere: The gun nuts blamed the video games and a lack of adequate mental health care, the gamers blamed Lanza's parents, and advocates for people with autism blamed the gun industry."", 'If there was a paucity of information, there was certainly no shortage of opinion and argument.', 'For the most part, Lysiak avoids interpretation of his own.', 'Through a judicious use of expert quotes he conveys that people with autism are not mentally ill and are no more prone to violence than the neurotypical.', 'No causal relationship between video games and violent behavior has been shown.', 'Finally, all of the guns Lanza owned were acquired legally, by his mother, although it seems obvious that whatever reason one might have to own a weapon capable of firing scores of rounds and mowing down 26 human beings in five minutes is probably a really, really bad reason.', 'Nancy Lanza was the one person in a position to see how far off the rails Adam had gone.', 'She was a tireless advocate and caregiver for her son, who had multiple neurological conditions that made it difficult for him to lead a normal life, and who had become totally isolated.', 'He had no friends and seldom left his room (although a report released last month suggested that he might have visited a local theater to play Dance Dance Revolution).', 'He could not bear to be touched, eventually communicating with her primarily by email, and was distressed at the slightest variation in his environment and routine.', 'In the past, a major tailspin had been triggered when he started high school and was expected to change classrooms several times per day.', 'His mother eventually pulled him out of school and educated him at home until he got his GED, and the Lanzas, it should be noted, were well-off enough to get him proper care.', 'For Nancy -- described by a friend as a ""live free or die"" New Hampshire native who ""came from a culture of guns"" -- target practice was a wholesome family activity and one of the few ways she felt able to bond with her son.', ""Yet Lysiak also establishes that in 2012 Nancy Lanza was both very concerned about Adam's mental state and had more or less given up on drawing him out of his shell, although she did hope that a planned move out of state might change that."", 'Furthermore, Nancy was worried enough to venture into the forbidden sanctum of her son\'s room, where she discovered many disturbing drawings, ""gruesome depictions of death, images of mutilated corpses,"" including a ""grassy field lined with the corpses of young children.""', 'Was she also aware of the ""massive spreadsheet, seven feet long and four feet wide,"" ranking ""the top five hundred mass murderers in world history""?', 'That would seem like a hard thing either to miss or to shrug off.', 'According to a friend in whom Nancy Lanza confided after finding the pictures, she hesitated to confront her son because ""she feared he might further shut her out"" and ""he would be lost forever.""', 'Adam Lanza was also, by that point, heavily armed, and if his mother worried that any disturbance might provoke a violent reaction, she was probably right.', 'Yet a resistance to seeking help -- or, perhaps, a contentious temperament that caused her to find fault with much of the help offered -- had left this self-reliant Yankee with the perception that she had few options.', 'The contrast here with the abundantly interconnected community of Sandy Hook is obvious, although Lysiak never underlines that point.', 'Other people, for all their meddling and aggravation, can be, among other things, an excellent source of reality checks.', ""One of the pieces of evidence found in the Lanza house after the shooting was a bank draft that Nancy Lanza had written for Adam's forthcoming Christmas present -- yet another gun."", 'Laura Miller is the author of ""The Magician\'s Book: A

success.', 'Even the signature Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is imploding, and was dubbed a “train wreck” by one of its own Senatorial authors.', 'The lead-from-behind retrenchment abroad from America’s traditional leadership role has won few adherents.', 'The Benghazi tragedy and the series of alphabet-soup debacles involving the IRS, the NSA, and the AP journalists are the most disturbing political scandals we’ve seen since the Nixon administration.', 'What, then, is the Obama legacy?', 'An insidious politicization of almost everything.', 'Obamism has become a holistic concept of “fundamentally transforming America” that, like all ideologies, cannot be assessed solely by concrete laws and policies, but rather through a change in the mentality and spirit of Americans and those who govern them.', 'Obama early on emphasized in messianic fashion that his hope-and-change agenda was not to be adjudicated by traditional metrics, but involved a cosmic transformation of hearts and minds: “I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” More specifically, the president himself through such colorful rhetoric has often outlined his all-encompassing “spread-the-wealth” ideology.', 'Self-employed business people did not really “build” their successful operations without government help: “If you’ve got a business—you didn’t build that.', 'Somebody else made that happen.” “Fat cats” and “corporate jet owners” have preyed on the body politic.', 'Profit-driven doctors have unnecessarily lopped off limbs and yanked out tonsils.', 'In a more philosophical vein, Obama advised that an individual should recognize a point beyond which he need not make any more money.', 'The subtext is always that in this zero-sum world, personal success comes not through the individual’s efforts, but at the expense of someone else.', 'The Affordable Care Act was not intended just to extend health insurance to the uninsured or to decrease premium costs.', 'Indeed, so far Obamacare has had the opposite effect of raising costs and increasing the numbers of the uninsured.', 'Aside from growing government, increasing federal jobs, and limiting free choice, Obamacare federalized healthcare to ensure Americans fairness, defined as the economic equality of result as technocrats decide who had wrongly acquired too much healthcare, who unfairly had access to too little, and so on.', 'In that regard, the recent disclosures that some Obamacare “navigators” acted like politicized operatives (e.g., “turning Texas blue”), have sometimes offered advice to consumers to defraud the government, and often worked in league with liberal activist groups and the Democratic Party were not surprising.', 'It is the duty of a progressive federal government to make the necessary redistributive changes to ensure that the more deserving obtained more healthcare and the less deserving were to pay for it.', 'Only elites possess the savvy to oversee the necessary transaction for the ignorant.', 'Or, as the President said of popular anger at Obamacare, “the majority of folks will end up being better off, of course… They don’t necessarily know it right [now].” When Barack Obama advised his Latino supporters to adopt a political stance in which “We’re going to punish our enemies and we’re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us,” he simply illustrated how the immigration debate had become driven by ideology.', 'The issues are not non-partisan criteria about qualifications for legal immigration—education levels, skill sets, or capital.', 'Nor is there much nonpartisan concern with border enforcement and the sanctity of federal law.', 'Instead, the influx of millions of mostly poor Latin Americans and Mexican nationals and their incorporation into the United States, as liberal citizen constituents and consumers of federal programs, drive the debate.', 'Anything or anyone that might hamper those political efforts prompts the necessary philological rejoinders—both the overblown invectives of “nativist” or “racist” and the usual Orwellian euphemisms (“illegal immigrant” or “illegal alien” must be replaced by the politically-correct “undocumented worker”).', 'To make legal immigration entirely meritocratic and ethnically- and racially-blind would not necessarily ensure the sort of immigrant pool receptive to the Obama ideological agenda, and is therefore opposed by Democrats.', 'Predicating amnesties on criteria like prior crime-free residence without dependence on federal and state entitlements would likewise be ideologically incorrect and not serve the larger agenda.', 'No one believes that the present immigration debate is concerned with the bureaucratic dilemma over granting green cards or citizenship to Eastern European doctors or South Korean engineers.', 'There was little mystery over the IRS scandals of illegally granting an estimated $132 billion in earned income tax credits to the undeserving, coupled with the unlawful scrutiny of the tax-exempt status of Tea-Party-like organizations.', 'No one initially assumed that an errant IRS either had been unduly stingy in paying credits to the deserving or had gone after the tax-exempt status of leftwing groups in equal number.', 'For an IRS commissioner like Lois Lerner and others in the age of Obama, the noble ends of using government to achieve social and economic equality apparently condone the occasional unpleasant means of transgressing existing and supposedly unfair laws.', 'The worry in the billion-dollar federal settlements in the Pigford case was not, in the words of the New York Times, that “the $50,000 payouts to black farmers had proved a magnet for fraud.” Rather, regulations about timely applications and eligibility were irritable details that paled in comparison with the larger truth that poorer people deserved redistributive compensation from

courtesy of <a href=""http://www.bushmaster.com/firearms/xm-15.asp"">Bushmaster</a>  Last December, four days after Adam Lanza murdered 20 first graders and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, Cerberus Capital Management pledged to sell the Freedom Group, the company that manufactured the Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that Lanza used.', 'The announcement helped tamp down a rising PR disaster for the Manhattan private equity firm, placating major investors such as the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS), which had said it was “examining” its $750 million stake in Cerberus after the massacre.', 'The New York Times described the move as “a rare instance of a Wall Street firm bending to concerns about an investment’s societal impact.” A year after the Newtown tragedy, however, Cerberus has not sold Freedom Group (also known as Remington Outdoor Company Inc.), the nation’s largest firearms and ammunition conglomerate.', 'After buyers failed to materialize early this year, Cerberus CEO Stephen Feinberg announced he and a small group of individuals would seek to buy the company, which also owns brands such as Remington, Marlin, and Dakota Arms.', 'But in July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Feinberg was dropping his bid amid increasingly attractive offers from outside investors.', '“Cerberus initially planned to seek around $1 billion for the company,” the Journal reported, citing an anonymous source, “but now wants more.” Business has boomed for Freedom Group in the year since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary.', 'Between January and the end of September, the company raked in $94 million in profits on more than $1 billion in gun and ammo sales, compared with just $500,000 in net profits during the same period in 2012.', 'For the full year ending December 31, Freedom Group estimates that its net sales will be up 34 percent to $1.25 billion, according to a financial disclosure (PDF) released Monday.', 'Though Freedom Group doesn’t release sales figures specifically for the Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle, that weapon and similar models reportedly flew off retailers’ shelves in the weeks after Sandy Hook, snatched up by firearms enthusiasts who feared the guns would soon be outlawed.', 'According to the Freedom Group’s third quarter report, this year’s earnings spike came primarily from a $42 million bump in sales of “centerfire rifles,” a category which includes the XM-15.', 'The report further notes that Freedom Group’s leading sellers were “modern sporting rifles”—the firearms industry’s euphemism for assault weapons.', '“Consumer concern over more restrictive governmental regulation on the federal, state, and local levels has contributed to this increase in demand,” the report says.', 'The company would have sold even more guns, the report adds, if not for “sales demand being greater than our current production capacity in many categories.” “We wish that this anniversary were not coming and that we were not holding Freedom Group,” said Mike Sicilia, a spokesman for CalSTRS, adding that the teachers pension fund is prohibited by its investment contract with Cerberus from discussing financial details.', '“It’s difficult on all of us because we represent the futures of teachers.', 'Teachers were killed at Sandy Hook, and that gun was made by a company that we partially own.', 'We all feel that.” Sicilia suggested that withdrawing its large investment from Cerberus is a complicated matter, and is not the pension fund’s preference.', 'CalSTRS believes Cerberus “has made a good-faith effort to sell the company and will find a buyer,” he said.', 'In announcing its plans to sell the Freedom Group last December, Cerberus distanced itself from the brewing fight over gun control.', '“As a Firm, we are investors, not statesmen or policy makers,” said a Cerberus’ press release.', 'Our role is to make investments on behalf of our clients…It is not our role to take positions or attempt to shape or influence the gun policy debate.', 'That is the job of our federal and state legislators.” But the same cannot be said for the company it controls, whose ties to the most powerful gun lobbying group are clear.', 'In May, the National Rife Association inducted three Freedom Group executives—CEO George Kollitides, Vice Chairman Wally McLallen, and President Scott Blackwell—into its “Golden Ring of Freedom,” a group who’ve given the NRA at least $1 million.', '“Beyond the business world, [Kollitides] has made important contributions to conservation efforts and the gun rights movement,” Tyler Schropp, the head of the NRA’s major gifts department, said in a video honoring the new inductees.', 'And as Mother Jones first reported last January, Kollitides has sat on the NRA’s exclusive nine-member nominating committee, which closely controls who can be elected to the NRA board.', 'Judging from the fortunes of similar publicly traded gun companies, selling the Freedom Group in the immediate aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre would have meant leaving a lot of money on the table.', 'In the three days following the shooting, for instance, the stock of Smith & Wesson, which also makes assault rifles, fell by 20 percent.', 'Yet after the collapse of national gun control legislation this spring, Smith & Wesson shares quickly recovered, closing in August at their highest price since before the 2007 financial meltdown.', 'Cerberus’s failure to divest from the Freedom Group as its gun sales have soared suggests to some gun-control advocates that Cerberus hasn’t been a motivated seller.', '“It’s a concern,” says Jennifer Fiore, the executive director of Campaign to Unload, a coalition of some 30 education and gun control associations organized by New York Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio.', '“It leads one to question whether they are negotiating in good faith.” Cerberus did not respond to requests for comment.', 'But according to a report in the New York Times on Monday, the company now says it has a plan to offer concerned investors like CalSTRS a way out with “an interim step”: It will allow them to sell their stakes in Cerberus to a third-party investor, which will take a minority stake in Freedom Group and provide about $200 million in debt financing.', 'The deal would value Freedom Group at about $1.2 billion.', 'On Monday, Campaign to Unload, religious leaders, and gun violence victims held a vigil outside Cerberus’ Manhattan headquarters aimed at pressuring it further to divest from Freedom Group.', '“Half measures from Cerberus Capital Management are not enough,” Fiore said in a press release.', '“As principal owner of one of the most toxic products in America, Cerberus and its CEO, Stephen Feinberg, have an ethical imperative to unequivocally divest from Freedom Group.”  Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your

2013 | 2:19pm WASHINGTON — The FBI has helped to disrupt or prevent nearly 150 shootings and violent attacks this year, in part by steering potential gunmen toward mental health professionals.', 'There have been hundreds of these disruptions since 2011, Attorney General Eric Holder told an audience of police chiefs in October, touting the behind-the-scenes work of a small FBI unit based out of Quantico, Va.', 'In most cases, the FBI has helped potential offenders get access to mental health care.', 'Preventing mass shootings through threat assessments and treatment is an unusual tactic for an agency known for its crime fighting and not for interventions.', 'The achievement stands out during a time when President Barack Obama made curbing gun violence a priority for his administration, yet has had very little success.', 'One year after the deadly mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, the White House’s biggest efforts to curb gun violence — attempts to reinstate the assault weapons ban and expand background checks for all gun purchases — failed without congressional support.', 'Mass shootings like the rampages in Newtown, Conn., the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard and the Aurora, Colo., movie theater do not represent the majority of gun violence.', 'Yet when they do occur, the impact is high.', 'And many times there’s the question of whether the shooter had adequate mental health treatment to prevent it from happening.', 'Yet, in the national discourse about reducing gun violence, mental health treatment has received much less attention than banning assault weapons.', 'The FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, for years, has been working with state and local authorities to profile potential offenders with the goal of preventing violent crimes like mass shootings.', 'The “prevented” shootings and violent attacks from January through November of this year represent 148 cases that a division of that unit, the Behavioral Threat Assessment Center, has conferred on during 2013.', 'And that number is up 33 percent from 2012, Andre Simmons, unit chief of the center, said in an interview with The Associated Press.', 'In the past year, this unit has received about three new cases a week referred by federal, state, local and campus law enforcement, schools, businesses and houses of worship, Simmons said.', 'The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center gets involved when someone notifies law enforcement, for example, about some troubling behavior, and law enforcement reaches out to the center to help assess the situation.', '“The people around that subject often become fearful that that outcome is catastrophic act of violence, such as an active shooting or some type of mass attack,” Simmons said.', 'The center is staffed by agents and analysts of the FBI, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives and a psychiatrist.', 'It helps the local officials assess the threat the person of concern poses.', 'And then the center recommends how to proceed.', 'Depending how far along the person is on the “pathway to violence,” Simmons said, the center makes recommendations based on the specific case.', 'The recommendations could be arrest, if the person is involved in illegal activity, but most often, it’s getting that person access to mental health care, he said.', 'As an example, Simmons referred to a case his unit consulted on a few years back.', 'There was a man at a university who began to display bizarre behaviors coupled with an increasing interest in firearms, Simmons said.', 'This man created a makeshift shooting range in the basement of his home where he lived with roommates, and he used pictures of the roommates as bull’s-eyes for target practice.', 'He also was involved in animal abuse, Simmons said, and he was making statements that were troubling.', 'Collecting firearms and target practice are not illegal activities, but the roommates feared for their safety.', 'So they alerted university authorities, Simmons said.', 'The university reached out to the FBI behavioral analysts and worked with them to develop a strategy.', 'Working with mental health officials and campus police, a “caretaking” interview was arranged with the man, Simmons said.', 'And that meeting resulted in a voluntary admission to a psychiatric facility.', '“Once in that facility, he was deemed to be of such compromised state, that it turned into an involuntary evaluation,” Simmons said.', '“And the attending physician noted as well that it was not really a question of if he would attack, but when, given the statements that he made and the thoughts he was disclosing.” The FBI would not provide specific details of this case or others they’ve consulted on because many are ongoing and involve people who have not been charged with crimes.', 'The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center operates with the knowledge that mass shootings like Newtown are uncommon, and that’s important, said Ronald Schouten, a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and expert on threat assessments.', '“These occur very rarely, and there’s no profile,” Schouten said of those who carry out the shootings.', 'The center was launched in the fall of 2010.', 'The unit’s existence is not yet common knowledge around the country.', 'But awareness is growing, as the FBI has recently been sponsoring two-day conferences about the threat of active shooters, Simmons said.', 'Having a mental illness does not mean that a person is predisposed to violent behavior, Simmons said.', 'So a person’s history and surroundings are an important part of assessing the threat.', '“And we recognize that for many individuals, the coping strategies may be overwhelmed and they may lose the ability to see an alternative to violence,” he said.', 'One year ago, a 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and massacred 20 children and six women with a semi-automatic rifle.', 'He also killed his mother in their Newtown home before driving to the school.', 'He committed suicide as police arrived at the scene, and authorities still do not know his motive.', 'Since the shooting, Lanza has been described as “troubled.” Investigators said his fascination with violence was apparent to teachers and other acquaintances.', 'After that tragedy, Obama spoke to the nation about reducing gun violence.', '“We’re going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,” he said five days after the deadly shooting.', 'The Behavioral Threat Assessment Center has not been promoted by the White House as one of its major efforts to reduce gun violence.', 'Instead, it’s continued the behind-the-scenes work it’s been doing for the past three years.', 'And referrals keep coming in.', 'Read Next Horses used in labs end up on French dinner tables Share Selection This story has been shared 40,285 times.',

first Saturday morning in August, I stepped out of my car in a suburban Indiana parking lot and watched three middle-aged white men aim squinty-eyed suspicion at me from two spaces away.', 'As a Wisconsin native, I’m used to squinty-eyed white Midwestern suspicion.', 'But since we stood several hundred feet from a lot of guns and I figured the guys were probably armed, my feet froze.', 'I had to drag myself to the entrance of the Kokomo Gun Show, where a brown-haired stocky white guy in his twenties talked to his friends while resting his elbow on a rifle butt as if leaning on a gun was the most natural posture imaginable.', 'I passed hundreds of parked cars on my way to the front door.', 'This was a couple months after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine people in a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and a week after John Russell Hauser was accused of killing two and wounding nine in a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.', 'Gun purchases in America tend to spike after mass shootings and terrorist attacks, because such events heat up the gun control debate.', 'On this Black Friday — less than a month after the terrorist mass shooting in Paris — gun sales were projected to spike again.', 'There were 50 gun shows listed across the country, and the FBI predicted that gun sellers would run a record 190,000 background checks in a 24-hour period — not that prospective buyers need to undergo a background check to buy guns from private vendors at the Kokomo Gun Show or those in dozens of other states including Florida, Texas, and Ohio.', 'But background checks are required in Illinois, where my teenage cousin joined a gang and shot someone in 2010.', 'He took his lawyer’s advice not to talk about his case, so I channeled my sadness into learning how Chicago gangs like his get their guns.', 'More of the guns used in Chicago gang shootings come from Indiana than anywhere else.', 'On paper, buying a gun in Indiana is extremely easy.', 'Go to a gun show, decide on a gun from a seller’s private collection, hand over an Indiana ID and some cash, leave armed.', 'But I didn’t think I, a black woman, would be welcome at a gun show.', 'Four people sat at the registration table: one white guy in his fifties and three women in their twenties, one of whom was black.', 'Her blackness threw me off nearly as much as the mood outside.', 'We made the sort of eye contact that meant we’d acknowledged each other’s blackness but we weren’t going to bond over it.', 'I paid the $5 admission fee and told the guy, who called me sweetie, that since I didn’t have a gun I didn’t need to check mine while I shop.', 'I turned away from him toward tables filled with more guns than I’d ever seen, forgot how to breathe, and retreated to the bathroom to calm myself behind a locked stall.', 'Americans like to use big tent metaphors to describe our political affiliations.', 'We paint our values with broad strokes and then point to the many types of people on our side as evidence that we are open-minded, accepting, and correct.', 'Pro-gun advocates are no exception: People in favor of lax gun laws say that since the majority of gun owners are law-abiding, reasonable people, we can overlook the bigots, the criminals, and the domestic terrorists like Robert Lewis Dear, who is accused of killing three people and injuring nine more at a Colorado Planned Parenthood on Black Friday.', 'As long as the lone criminals are white.', 'Last spring, Cliven Bundy, a Nevada rancher trespassing on federal land, faced off with federal agents while armed and suffered no consequences.', 'Same goes for the Oath Keepers, the militia that showed up heavily armed to Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson over the summer, angering local law enforcement — though evidently not as much as unarmed, black Michael Brown.', 'The previous year, John Crawford, III, 22, and Tamir Rice, 12, were shot and killed by police while carrying toy guns in Ohio, an open-carry state.', 'And in the past few years, other unarmed blacks have been killed for offenses such as selling hand-rolled cigarettes and asking for help after a car accident.', 'Black people aren’t part of the big tent of gun ownership.', 'We’re never assumed to be law abiding, reasonable gun owners.', 'That kind of gun ownership is seen as an upstanding white person act; a picket fence closed to outsiders like blacks.', 'I wanted to see what was on the other side of the slats separating me from perfectly honorable, white people gun show attendance.', 'The exhibition hall was 27,000 square feet, or about half a football field.', 'The lighting was fluorescent, the folding tables cheap, the guns sold alongside ammunition, knives, extra-strength flashlights, beef and turkey jerky, and lots of camo.', 'There were plenty of private vendors standing behind signs that said Private Collection, Cash Only, No Questions Asked.', ""One vendor tried to sell me one of his lovely retro guns, .38 specials with pearly stocks and long, tapered silver barrels that would look just right in a woman’s hand in a '60s art film."", 'But most of the guns in the room were standard black handguns and rifles.', 'The room’s demographics: roughly 300 people total, overwhelmingly white guys in their forties to seventies.', 'I saw three white female gun vendors, one South Asian male gun vendor, one black guy selling knives, one black woman selling guns, and one 10-year-old black kid scanning the tables with his white dad.', 'This was a lot more diversity than I expected, but not enough to stop people from staring at me.', 'The first person who seemed happy to see me was a biracial female gun vendor who asked me not to print her name.', 'G is 45 years old, half black, half white, and works part-time at a gym.', 'She didn’t often see black people at shows like this, and she was eager to talk about the racial demographics of gun shows.', 'The atmosphere is “conservative,” she told me, and “can feel unwelcoming sometimes.” Growing up in Indianapolis, G didn’t see the need for guns.', 'Then she moved to Kokomo, less than an hour outside the city, and met her white fiancée.', 'He educated her ""on guns and why they’re useful,” and manned the table across the aisle from us.', 'She owns guns, practices shooting them at a nearby range, and keeps them around for protection.', '“I don’t want to know what it’s like to use them,” she told me.', '“I’d rather not know.', 'I need the information, but I don’t want to use it.” I took another lap around the show.', 'The most charitable way to describe the mood was quiet.', 'Gun shoppers are not a talkative group.', 'White men looked at me with cut eyes and pinched mouths, but also at each other.', 'I saw one guy wearing a T-shirt that said It’s Not Racist If It’s True, and looked back at G from halfway across the room.', 'She seemed perfectly comfortable sitting behind her table, and I ached for her anyway, having to see T-shirts like that at shows like this.', 'I met one friendly white guy, Scott.', 'He said he sells a lot of guns to black women in Ohio and gushed to me about the AR-15.', 'He picked one up, put the gun’s butt on his chin and told me that thanks to its lack of recoil he could fire it in that position if he wanted.', 'I knew I was supposed to get excited about a gun I could fire from my face, so I added some oomph to my smile.', 'He recommended a nearby brewery for lunch.', 'Then I made eye contact with another round of flinty white men and re-entered the malaise that gripped the entire room.', 'My black dad is a sincere supporter of the Second Amendment.', 'He owns two rifles and two handguns.', 'The rifles are for deer hunting, a typical Wisconsinite passion.', 'The handguns are for home defense.', 'I grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, a roughly 250,000-person university town, where it was not uncommon for my high school classmates to miss an extra day or two around Thanksgiving to hunt deer.', 'I enjoy venison, especially when cooked in butter.', 'I do not own a gun, but I could.', 'I’m equally familiar with the uniquely white Midwestern combination of down-home friendliness and suspicion that I encountered at the gun show, in alternating rounds.', 'It’s subtle, but it’s constant, and I felt it for the 23 years I lived there.', 'Sometimes it bubbled into something more, like the fourth grader who called me a nigger at school.', 'But mostly it was the high school and college friends who told me I “wasn’t that black,” and confided in me about their love lives and career dreams.', 'It’s the dizzying swing from Scott and his lunch recommendations to the men who stare at me as if blinking might physically wound them.', 'It was a 25-year-old woman named Sarah’s job to collect the entry fee and make sure people didn’t steal the guns, which she told me they try to do “all the time.” Sarah didn’t own any guns herself, but she shot friends’ guns in their backyards.', 'Earlier I asked Scott where he shot his guns and he said the same thing: in his backyard.', 'I imagined entire Midwestern towns of people wandering out the back door on summer days to aim bullets into dirt.', 'Later it occurred to me what was missing from this picture: the kind of hunting culture that indicates people plan to shoot something other than each other.', 'There was no mention of deer, or skeet, or fun, or even a significant profit.', 'Scott said he only brings in $40 or $50 a gun.', 'All I found was a vague, room-wide fear that explains how G can be into guns and not want to have to use her guns.', 'The gun show is where that white suspicion arms itself.', 'Again, my dad’s a home invasion guy, so I kind of understand their fear.', 'And yet I don’t.', 'Ask white suspicion what it’s afraid of and it smiles frantically.', 'It evades the question, and it doubles down on its right to be white, suspicious, and armed.', 'One gun show table held pamphlets for the Oath Keepers, the non-partisan militia whose mission is to protect Americans from being disarmed — using assault rifles.', 'But what it feels like people are most suspicious of is me.', 'I turned a corner and found an overweight man in his sixties with a thin halo of hair and suspenders holding up his jeans behind a table full of bumper stickers.', 'Confederate flags screamed redly among the black and white right-wing slogans.', 'Here, in the Union state of Indiana, which outlawed slavery in 1820, gun owners embrace the national symbol for being willing to go to war for your right to abuse black people.', '“Never Give Up!” one said.', '“Deal With It!” said the other.', 'Looking at those stickers was like being slapped in the face.', 'I stood there paralyzed long enough to give the impression that I was seriously considering buying something.', 'When I realized that I feared the guy sitting behind the table too much to whip out my phone and photograph the stickers on the spot, I bought one of each so I could take my pictures at home.', 'I attempted to give off an “I am a badass for standing here and buying your Confederate flags even though you hate me” vibe.', 'But I doubt it covered the nervousness that made my armpit sweat pour down like rain.', 'The vendor didn’t care to make eye contact with me, even when I handed over my $3.', 'He furtively put the cash in his pocket and found a wall to contemplate with great passion.', 'I stared down hate and it wasn’t worth it.', 'The transaction ended quickly and not soon enough.', 'In defiance of Confederate flag number one, I gave up.', 'I walked outside and took my first deep breath in hours.', 'But the calm that settled over me upon leaving the gun show disappeared when I remembered the flags in my purse.', 'I was disgusted at myself for giving $3 to a man who despised me, a feeling that made my hands shake on the wheel.', 'For the entire 700-plus mile drive home I never took more than five minutes’ rest from cursing myself for donating money to the Confederate flag cause.', 'Kashana Cauley is a native Wisconsinite who lives in Brooklyn.', '""The Atlantic,"" ""Esquire,"" and ""McSweeney\'s Internet
