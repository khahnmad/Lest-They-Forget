3,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/22/systemic-racism-impacts-asian-americans-as-well/,"Trending: In the past year-and-a-half of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a dramatic rise in hate crimes against Asians. But the mass shooting of Asian women in Atlanta, the fatal attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee, the slashing of Noel Quintana’s face with a knife on a subway, the many attacks on our Asian elders – these anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiments are nothing new. These tragic events are reminiscent of the 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, the Chinese American brutally murdered by two former auto workers who blamed Japanese auto companies for the loss of their jobs. While President Biden’s actions signing into law the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Bill on May 20th is commendable, they’re only first steps. More must be done to identify long-term solutions that can address the structural racism affecting the safety and health of Asian Americans. First, we can start by acknowledging that even those who are not direct victims of hate crimes experience worsened health as a result. Reports of the elderly avoiding walks and families postponing trips to the grocery store in fear of anti-Asian hate crimes are widespread, and such accounts of people consistently avoiding daily activities in public spaces due to the perceived dangers of living their lives can be a mental strain not only to the people choosing to stay sheltered at home but to those who hear of these painful stories as well. Second, we need to increase health care access for underserved Asian Americans. Language and culture gaps are huge barriers preventing Asian Americans from reporting hate crimes and receiving adequate health care, and our current healthcare system fails to sufficiently invest in health care providers and infrastructure that can help address those issues. For many Asian Americans, this may manifest into situations where individuals delay basic preventive health care check-ups in fear of potential social discomfort or discrimination, waiting until their health deteriorates to a point where it is too late. Third, we need immigration reform. Immigration policy directly impacts public health,  as federal law requires most legal immigrants to wait five years before they can qualify for federal safety net benefits, including the Affordable Care Act and non-emergency Medicaid. The problem is, even when immigrants do qualify for health benefits, they choose not to use them out of fear that it may jeopardize their legal status in the country and path to U.S. citizenship. Popular (and harmful) sentiments about immigration and race become enshrined in immigration policy, exacerbating health disparities and proliferating xenophobic ideas that affect Asian Americans, who are often perceived as perpetual foreigners regardless of their actual citizenship status. Furthermore, my research suggests that stress from the long and arduous process of applying for an immigration visa, a process exacerbated by politically created immigration visa backlogs, contribute to health disparities among Asian immigrants in the U.S. We need immigration policies that are just and equitable, and that streamline the immigration application process.

Finally, accurate data infrastructure that can shed light on the discrimination Asians experience in housing, healthcare, education, and the workforce are essential. One of the major reasons we have not done more to address inequities for Asian groups is because we have not had the data to do so. Especially needed are data that disaggregate Asians into the various Asian ethnic subgroups. Asian subgroups are extremely diverse socioeconomically, linguistically, and culturally. Disaggregating Asian subgroup data will help to identify where the needs are in our diverse community and direct resources to those in need. Asian Americans experience systemic racism in all sectors of society, but our needs are often overlooked.

4,https://www.startribune.com/a-year-in-the-life-of-the-city-that-killed-george-floyd/600060231/,"Once upon a time in Minneapolis, a police officer drove through a crowded downtown intersection, aimed a can of Mace out the window, and started spraying bystanders as if they were cockroaches. Coughing, I tweeted out a brief video of the incident on Hennepin Avenue, then went back to covering the protest last May, under the watchful eye of the Bob Dylan mural. Just another bad moment in the city's worst year. It has been viewed millions of times since then. A 22-second statement about the relationship between police and the policed, here in the city that killed George Floyd. A year ago Tuesday, we watched George Floyd die. We watched the people rise up in protest. We watched police meet overwhelming grief with overwhelming force. We watched Lake Street burn. ""This last year has just been a barrage of trauma for all communities,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said last week, just after a bullet killed 6-year-old Aniya Allen and just before a weekend mass shooting outside a downtown nightclub. It is hard to move on when it feels like it is not over. We remember the tears and the prayers, the smell of smoke and the crunch of glass underfoot. The first bright strokes of paint on the mural at the corner of 38th and Chicago. The thump-thump-thump of Blackhawk helicopters overhead. The helpers who spent weeks sweeping up broken glass and donating food to neighborhoods that had lost every grocery store within a 10-mile radius. The deep bruises all over Terry Hempfling's body faded eventually. The memories have not. Again and again that week, Hempfling joined the protests. She stood vigil in George Floyd Square and helped medics treating the injured near the Third Precinct police station. That Friday night, she found herself pinned against a chain-link fence near the Fifth Precinct with two other women, trying to unlock their bikes and comply with police orders to go home. There was so much tear gas in the air, she couldn't tell if the streetlights were on or off. Two police lines marched toward them, firing a hail of projectiles. ""I was in such a state of adrenaline, I didn't immediately realize we were being hit,"" said Hempfling, who has attended protests since she was a baby and had never experienced such violent retaliation. ""We were sitting ducks right there, just trying to unlock our bikes. Me, my friend, and one other woman ... from both sides, there were lines of police coming towards us."" Hempfling and her friend vaulted over a fence to safety. The next morning, she woke to find her body covered in bruises from less-lethal projectiles — on her back, on her breast, on her leg, where one bruise spread from her knee to her hip. We'd like to make sure this sort of violence never happens again, but we can't even get answers about why it happened last time. The city still has not released the name of the officer who Maced a crowd of people out exercising their constitutional rights last May, or any reports from the incident. Frey said the officer went on unpaid leave a few months later and left the force for good last month. ""I saw the same video that everyone else did and I was angered by what looks like to be a totally unnecessary escalation of a situation that was already completely escalated,"" Frey said. Information about that one small incident is tangled in a web of data practice requests and contract law and Minnesota's police arbitration process that undermine the mayor and police chief when they try to discipline their own police force. A few years ago, the mayor and chief tried to fire the officers who decked out the Fourth Precinct Christmas tree with racist garbage. An arbitrator returned one of the officers to duty last year. ""That whole Macing incident maybe only took a few seconds, but the impact on the public consciousness will be there for years,"" Frey said. ""That particular incident, I think, is ingrained in people's memory and does so much to prevent trust from forming."" There were at least 550 complaints lodged against Minneapolis police during the first two weeks of protest following Floyd's death. The ACLU of Minnesota filed two lawsuits against the city — one on behalf of protesters, including Hempfling; one on behalf of the press. The U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department's use of force. ""We don't know when the next time the police are going to kill another Black, Indigenous or person of color from our community. But we know that's going to happen,"" said Isabella Nascimento, staff attorney for the ACLU of Minnesota. ""We bring these cases to [ensure] when that inevitably happens, the community, protesters and the press aren't inhibited from speaking out, from doing their jobs, from voicing their concerns."" People matter. If the past year taught us anything, you'd think it would have taught us that. But when it came time for a verdict in the Derek Chauvin murder trial, the city that killed George Floyd wrapped itself in razor wire and stationed military vehicles in the streets to protect property. And when Daunte Wright was killed at a traffic stop — shot to death by a Brooklyn Center police officer who apparently pulled her gun instead of her Taser — in the middle of the Chauvin trial, police unleashed a ferocious barrage of flashbangs, projectiles and chemical munitions against protesters. They broke bones with rubber bullets. Late last year, Hempfling left Minneapolis to care for her terminally ill father, a longtime civil rights activist. She returned last month to find the city boarded up and patrolled by National Guard troops. ""I felt terrible being here,"" she said. ""I was really feeling like this is not a place I want to live."" But recently, she's been feeling better. She joined the ACLU lawsuit, putting herself out there once again. Minneapolis' worst year is almost over. Whether the next is any better is up to us. jennifer.brooks@startribune.com 612-673-4008 Jennifer Brooks is a local columnist for the Star Tribune.

News By Sam Raskin and Kate Sheehy Submit May 23, 2021 | 8:32am				| Updated May 23, 2021 | 2:23pm A mass shooting erupted at a birthday party at a sprawling New Jersey home Saturday night, leaving two people dead and at least a dozen more wounded, according to cops. The ’90s-themed bash in Fairfield Township outside of Vineland drew several hundred people eager to celebrate the start of the warm weather before the carnage occurred at the house around 11:50 p.m., neighbors said. “I just started hearing at first what I thought was fireworks. It was really gunshots, and I heard nine in rapid succession,” said the Rev. Michael Keene of the nearby Trinity AME Church to the local ABC-TV affiliate. Neighbor James Johnson told NJ.com, “I looked outside my window — I seen people scattering behind my yard. “People running, driving through my yard, ringing my doorbell, screaming for help. They said there was a shooting behind my house. “They still had alcohol in their hand, they were screaming, they were just so distraught,” Johnson said. “People were speeding down the roads, people was running, screaming — it was chaos.” John Fuqua said his nephew was at the gig and heard the gunfire — and ran for his life into the woods. “My nephew said he was having a good time, and next thing, all he heard was shooting, and he was running for his life,’’ the uncle told NBC New York. “He got on the ground, he had to crawl. He stepped over a dead body,’’ Fuqua said. Keene was perplexed by the shooting. “If you’re going to a party, why do you need to take a gun?” the pastor told ABC. “If you’re there to have a good time, why do you need a gun with you? That means you’re expecting trouble to me.” A 25-year-old woman and 30-year-old man died of gunshot wounds, New Jersey State Police said on social media. It is unclear what sparked the gunfire, and there have been no reported arrests. Helicopter video of the scene showed cars, a knocked-down tent and debris in a yard outside the large home. A “heartbroken” uncle of one of the victims told ABC that his niece was a “good girl.” Her condition was unclear. The head of a local advocacy group for troubled youth told NBC that several of their kids were at the party. “It was hundreds of people, our neighbors, who were just getting together because it was the first really warm, nice night,’’ said Hopeloft founder Melissa Helmbrecht. “There were a lot of parties and get-togethers throughout the community, and this was probably the biggest,’’ she said. Gov. Phil Murphy condemned the violence in a statement Sunday. “Let there be no mistake: This despicable and cowardly act of gun violence only steels our commitment to ensuring New Jersey leads the nation in passing and enforcing strong and commonsense gun safety laws,” he said in a tweet. “No community should ever experience what occurred last night in Fairfield.” Read Next Man charged with kidnapping Cash Gernon seen at his home w...

A dozen other people were wounded, several with life-threatening injuries, in the gunfire that erupted at the 1990s-themed birthday party with hundreds of guests in a mansion in Fairfield Township just minutes before midnight Saturday, New Jersey State Police said. The location is about 50 miles south of Philadelphia. The deadly melee eerily coincided with a fatal mass shooting in North Charleston, S.C., also on Saturday night, evoking worries about rising violence as people start getting together more as pandemic fears subside. The shooting in South Carolina, which killed a 14-year-old and wounded 14 other people, broke out after an argument at an unlicensed concert, according to CNN. In New Jersey, guests at the crowded party were as young as 15, said John Fuqua, who had family members at the ill-fated event. “A handful of idiots started to pull out guns and started shooting,” Fuqua said. “Nobody at that party wanted to get shot. They were celebrating life.” One of those killed was partygoer Kevin Elliot, 30, whose violent death horrified his family, his cousin Eric Elliot, 38, told the Daily News. “It’s devastating to hear something like that. I would have never expected for someone like him to get shot,” the cousin said. “But what can you expect when you have a party with hundreds of people?” The other fatality was a 25-year-old woman, officials said. No arrests were made as of Sunday. Gruesome video posted to social media showed panicked scenes of the shooting’s aftermath, with some people gathered around bleeding victims lying on the ground while others raced to get away. Partygoers ran through neighboring yards, looking for places to hide, and cars crashed into each other as drivers tried to speed away. “Oh my God, he’s gone,” a woman could be heard wailing as police officers performed chest compressions on a bloodied victim. “Why? Why?” another woman shrieked as she knelt next to a motionless body. “It wasn’t a random act of violence,” said Fuqua. “It was a mass shooting, something out of a war movie.” Aerial views show a mansion with tents knocked over and bottles strewn around the property. Joeron and James Pierce, two cousins who live nearby, said they heard loud music from the party all evening and then a series of at least 15 shots stretched out over a few minutes. “Nobody knows when someone’s going to come out of the woods with a gun,” Fairfield Township Mayor Benjamin Byrd said at the scene Sunday. The reverend of the church across the street from the shooting told local television that he also heard the shots. “If you’re going to a party, why do you need to take a gun?” said the Rev. Michael Keene of the Trinity AME Church. “If you’re there to have a good time, why do you need a gun with you? That means you’re expecting trouble to me.” Police were searching woods and a cemetery near the mansion Sunday for clues in their investigation. “We hold those who have died, and their families, in our prayers today,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement. “We also pray for the recoveries of those injured. “Let there be no mistake: This despicable and cowardly act of gun violence only steels our commitment to ensuring New Jersey leads the nation in passing and enforcing strong and commonsense gun safety laws,” Murphy added.

Jowan Contrail Carroll, 24, is being held at Hennepin County Adult Detention Center, Minneapolis Police Department public information officer, John Elder, told ABC News. There are currently no charges against Carroll; the department has until noon on Tuesday to issue charges, but police are looking at a probable murder charge, Elder said. Another suspect is dead, he confirmed. That suspect's identification will not be released until the medical examiner's office completes its investigation. Two people are dead, including one of the suspects. Seven received non-life-threatening injuries and one remains in critical condition. The Minneapolis Police Department said all 10 shooting victims are adults, five male and five female. The two deceased victims are males. The shooting involved a dispute between two people who both pulled out guns and started shooting at each other, according to Elder. The incident took place downtown along the 300 block of North 1st Avenue. The violence Friday follows other recent shootings in the city, including the death of a 6-year-old girl earlier this week. Aniya Allen was shot in the head while riding in a vehicle. No arrest has been made in that case. The shooting also comes a year after George Floyd's police-involved death in Minneapolis. Former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, second-degree manslaughter and third-degree murder. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June. Three other former Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's fatal shooting -- Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao -- have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. They have all pleaded not guilty and are awaiting a trial scheduled for March 2022.

11,https://abcnews.go.com/US/dead-12-injured-jersey-birthday-party-shooting/story?id=77858249,"Two people were killed and 12 were injured. Birthday party shooting leaves 2 dead, 12 injured in New Jersey A mass shooting at an outdoor birthday party at a southern New Jersey home that left two people dead and 12 injured was a targeted attack, officials said on Monday. A massive search for unidentified assailants continued Monday morning in Cumberland County, where a barrage of gunfire broke out at a large home in Bridgeton, New Jersey, near Fairfield, just before midnight on Saturday, prompting party revelers to dive for cover or run for their lives. ""This was not a random act of violence. This was a targeted attack,"" New Jersey State Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said at a news conference. Cumberland County prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae said one person has been arrested. She identified the suspect in custody as Kevin K. Dawkins, 36, of Bridgeton, and that he has been charged with unlawful possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of a large capacity ammunition magazine, and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes. She said Dawkins is being held at the Cumberland County Jail. Citing the ongoing investigation, Web-McRae declined to say if Dawkins is suspected of firing a weapon during the birthday party shooting in Bridgeton. It's unknown if the suspect has legal representation at this time. Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said multiple weapons and shell casings were found at the shooting scene and that more arrests are anticipated. Gurbir identified the two people fatally shot as 30-year-old Kevin Elliott and 25-year-old Asia Hester, both of Bridgeton. Webb-McRae said the 12 people wounded in the shooting ranged in age from 19 to 35, and that several remain in grave condition at hospitals. One partygoer who described himself as Hester's uncle told ABC station WPVI in Philadelphia that his niece was ""a good girl"" and he is ""absolutely heartbroken."" Aerial video from WPVI's helicopter showed evidence of the chaos that erupted, with tents and chairs toppled and debris strewn across the property. A motive for the shooting remains under investigation, Callahan said. He asked anyone with information about the episode to contact state investigators immediately. Police officers were seen combing through a cemetery across the street from the home where the shooting occurred and an adjacent wooded area. ""The state troopers who arrived at the scene didn't know if someone was waiting in the woods to ambush them as they responded to the calls, neither did the paramedics who came to tend to the wounded,"" Gov. Phil Murphy said at Monday's news conference. ""Thankfully, by that time the shooting had stopped."" Callahan said that prior to the shooting, state troopers were called to investigate noise complaints at another house party in Bridgeton. He said that party broke up around 11 p.m. Saturday and some attendees went to the birthday party on nearby East Commerce Street, where the shooting broke out. He said several hundred people were attending the birthday party, which community leaders said was a 1990s-themed event. Callahan said that about 11:30 p.m., a state trooper was in the area finishing up a traffic stop when he heard what sounded like fireworks or gunfire. He said the trooper and others rushed to the East Commerce Street home as 911 dispatchers began to receive numerous reports of a mass shooting in progress. ""I just started hearing at first what I thought was fireworks, it was really gunshots, and I heard nine in rapid succession,"" Rev. Michael Keene of the nearby Trinity AME Church, told WPVI. ""If you're going to a party, why do you need to take a gun? If you're there to have a good time, why do you need a gun with you? That means you're expecting trouble to me."" The shooting comes during a surge in gun violence across the country and marked at least the third time in 47 days that multiple people have been shot at birthday parties. On May 6, six adults were fatally shot at a birthday celebration in Colorado Springs, Colorado, by a gunman who died by suicide, police said. On April 5, a mother and her two daughters were fatally shot at a birthday party in Brooklyn, New York, for a 9-year-old girl, who hid in a room and called 911, telling an operator the slayings were committed by her father, who was later found dead after taking his own life. Murphy condemned the gun tragedy in Bridgeton as a ""despicable and cowardly act."" He called the shooting a ""microcosm of the scale of gun violence"" happening across New Jersey and the country. ""We are at the point where this kind of horrific scene is almost part of our daily lives. It has become commonplace,"" Murphy said. ""If there is one thing we can never normalize it is senseless gun violence.""

Sunday, 23 May 2021 04:20 PM Dylann Roof, the South Carolina white supremacist convicted of murdering nine congregants of a Black church, is appealing to have his sentence overturned, the New York Daily News reported on Sunday. His attorneys will make oral arguments set to start this Tuesday before a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, according to AP. Roof became the first person sentenced to death for a federal hate crime following  the 2015 mass shooting of a Bible study group at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, according to the Daily News. Roof’s lawyers  have requested that his sentence be suspended until a “proper competency evaluation” can be carried out, claiming that he should not have been sentenced to death due to his “mental illness.” Although the court held two competency hearings for him, one before his trial began and another before the start of the sentencing phase, Roof’s attorneys said he did not fail those competency hearings due to his delusional belief that he would be rescued from prison by other white supremacists. Roof’s lawyers said in a brief that an appellate court should vacate Roof’s convictions and death sentence, or send the case back to a lower court for “proper competency evaluation,” according to AP, adding that the federal trial that decided on a death sentence “departed so far from the standard required when the government seeks the ultimate price that it cannot be affirmed.” Roof filed his appeal in January 2020, with his attorneys arguing that he had been too mentally ill to stand trial or represent himself at his sentencing, according to The Hill. The appeal described Roof as a “22-year-old, ninth-grade dropout diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, autism, anxiety, and depression, who believed his sentence didn’t matter because white nationalists would free him from prison after an impending race war.” He at first cooperated with his lawyers until they planned to argue he was “developmentally disabled or mentally ill,” according to The Hill. At that point, Roof  decided to represent himself, although he briefly reinstated them for part of the trial before returning to representing himself again for the sentencing.   © 2021 Newsmax.

Metro By Reuven Fenton Submit May 23, 2021 | 4:57pm				| Updated May 24, 2021 | 9:19am Shaken partygoers at the New Jersey barbecue-turned-mass shooting recounted the horror to The Post on Sunday — as one said the violence stemmed from a decades-old turf war. “I was sitting on a chair talking to my daughter and a friend. We were laughing. Next thing I knew, I hear shots fired, like 20 shots,’’ Sunshine Carter, 44, said of the deadly gunfire that broke out at a sprawling home in Fairfield Township in southern Cumberland County late Saturday. “Then it stopped, then 10, 15 more,’’ Carter said of the bullets. “I didn’t know if they had to reload. I didn’t know if it was two shooters, one shooter. I was running for my dear life. “A girl ran in front of me, got shot. It could have been me. My friend was trying to help her.” Two people were killed in the carnage: 25-year-old Asia Hester, a Jamaican immigrant and hardworking health care staffer, and Kevin Elliot, 30. Some guests suggested that the man was the target — with the shooting stemming from two local rival factions of young men. “It’s South Side young boys vs. North Side young boys,’’ said a female guest who asked not to be identified. “This has been going on since the ’60s, and now they’re getting crazier with it. They’re bringing guns. “Usually, when they do that, they let off a couple [rounds], and that’s it,’’ she said. “But last night, they just kept going. People were running, falling. People were dying. It went on for 5, 10 minutes, running from bullets.” Carter said the female homeowner is a “family-oriented woman” who was throwing a 1990s-themed birthday bash for her nephew complete with a DJ, tents and security when shots rang out at the house across from a cemetery in the bucolic area. The guest described how she frantically searched for her kids amid the chaos. “They’re grown, but they’re still my kids. I’m running around looking for them, I can’t find them. I can’t find my phone to call them,’’ Carter recalled. “I’m being trampled on. All because we had a family barbecue. We were having a good day, a good time. These idiots just come in and shoot innocent people, and for what? Why? Just crazy. “I didn’t see anybody arguing before. It was just out of the blue — pop, pop, pop, pop, pop — and we hauled a–. “We’ve never been through anything like this before. This is a family home,” Carter said. “And to come when everyone’s having a good time and just start shooting? Come on now, you bastards.” A friend of Elliott’s, who wished to remain anonymous, called his death “tragic.”“He was a good kid who’d made his peace with life and had trouble with nobody. He showed up to a party to celebrate a happy occasion, and ended up dead. I can’t make sense of it,” the friend said. As mourners packed Hester’s family home less than a mile from the scene Sunday, her weeping sister, Crystal, told The Post, “I talked to her yesterday before she went [to the party].“She didn’t deserve this,’’ the shattered sibling said.A male relative decried the senseless bloodshed.“She was a good person, very respectable,” he said of Hester. “It’s just a tragic situation. Something’s got to be done.’’The dead woman’s family said she graduated from Rowan College in South Jersey and worked in health care. Her Facebook page listed her employer as Jefferson Health.She was originally from Kingston, Jamaica, according to her page.“She was an A student,’’ said Laquanta Davis, 26, who grew up with Hester.“She didn’t get out much,’’ Davis said. “She wasn’t the type who went out to parties, so that took me by surprise.“Who would have ever thought it would turn out this way for her.

22,https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-to-bring-in-outside-help-to-deal-with-surge-in-violence/600060508/,"Minneapolis police are bringing in outside help as they try to temper violence that killed four people this weekend alone, including a college senior who was out celebrating graduation. Mayor Jacob Frey said the city has asked state and federal agencies for assistance, citing the city's shortage of officers. ""Safety in our city has to be a priority,"" Frey said at a news conference Sunday, calling the reinforcements ""really, really critical."" The weekend's victims include two men believed to have been struck by gunfire on the North Side and two men killed in a mass downtown shooting: one of the suspected gunmen and the student, whose family said was ""an innocent bystander."" The increase in violence has tested the commitment of city leaders who unanimously promised to transform policing and public safety in the wake of George Floyd's death — but are deeply divided about how to proceed. While debates about policing have proved to be divisive within City Hall, some of the victims' relatives said they hope to remove politics from the discussion. They want a solution that will keep other families from feeling pain like theirs.

                                            Charlie Johnson was shot and killed in downtown Minneapolis early Saturday, the same day he was to graduate from the University of St. Thomas with a mechanical engineering degree. University of St. Thomas student Charlie Johnson went out with friends on Friday night to celebrate their graduation the next day. Just before 2 a.m. Saturday, gunfire erupted along N. 1st Avenue between 3rd and 4th streets downtown. Johnson and his friends were walking home when they got hit by stray gunfire, his father, Greg Johnson, said Sunday. A close friend stayed nearby and tried to provide ""aid and comfort."" ""He was a ray of sunshine without a mean bone in his body,"" Greg Johnson said of his son. On Facebook, he described Charlie as ""the best of all of us,"" saying he ""left a beautiful impact on every single life he touched."" Greg Johnson asked people to say his son's name and to work toward ending gun violence. ""No politics please,"" he wrote, ""just love and compassion for each other as Charlie had for all of us. I AM CHARLIE!"" Police said shots erupted at bar closing time when two men got into a ""verbal confrontation"" on the crowded sidewalk. In addition to the two killed, eight people were injured by the gunfire. The other suspected shooter, a Bloomington man, 23, was arrested and booked on suspicion of murder. He had not been charged as of Sunday evening. The Star Tribune generally does not name suspects before they have been charged. Hours before the mass shooting, police responding to a ShotSpotter activation in the city's Jordan neighborhood about 8:40 p.m. found a car-crash victim with gunshot wounds. The man, whose name has not been released, died a short time later. That same night, there was a nonfatal shooting at the CC Club in south Minneapolis. Sunday, too, brought another death. Police suspect a man, whose name has not been released, was shot in the city's Hawthorne neighborhood. As people tried to rush him to the hospital to get treatment for his wounds, the car flipped, police said. The Medical Examiner's Office will rule on the precise cause of his death. Excluding that case, the city has had 31 homicides so far this year. The weekend's carnage added another layer of trauma to a community reeling from the shooting of three children on Minneapolis' North Side. On Sunday afternoon, relatives of the children gathered outside City Hall for an emotional news conference announcing a reward for information leading to arrests and convictions in their cases. Amid their pleas for information, they also called for peace in the community. The group has been keeping a vigil outside North Memorial Health Hospital. On Friday night, they heard the ""pop, pop, pop"" of gunshots coming from the direction of Broadway Avenue, said Randy Ottoson. He's the grandfather of Trinity Ottoson-Smith, 9, who was shot this month while jumping on a trampoline in a north Minneapolis yard. ""We need more police officers. There is no doubt in my mind,"" he said. Ottoson said the city needs need police reform because Black lives matter, but he believes it needs more police on the street, too. ""I'm praying for all of these families but, you know what, I'm praying for the next people too,"" Ottoson said. The surge in violence comes as the city is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of Floyd's killing. Nearly 200 Minneapolis police officers have left the department since Floyd's death, including dozens who filed PTSD claims after the unrest. The issue of police staffing has been contentious within City Hall. Frey unveiled a plan to eventually build the force's ranks back up close to its prior levels. Some other elected officials have argued the emphasis on police staffing is misplaced and that an increase in officers doesn't guarantee a decrease in violence. Almost all of the city's elected leaders have spoken about the importance of expanding mental health and violence prevention services, but they differ on whether police funding should be used to support that. Some of the possible solutions will be long-term — hinging on negotiations about how to use American Rescue Plan funding, or a proposal to replace MPD. Chief Medaria Arradondo provided few specifics about the shooting investigations Sunday, saying he didn't want to jeopardize them. Minneapolis police said they called in seven homicide detectives to work on the mass shooting case. The city's Office of Violence Prevention sent a ""very small group,"" including director Sasha Cotton, to work with families and bystanders, city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie said. They also sent ""a few teams"" to work downtown from roughly 10 p.m. Saturday to 3 a.m. Sunday ""engaging and de-escalating conflicts,"" she said. Frey said the city received help from state troopers Saturday night into Sunday and said the city is working with the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Arradondo said federal agencies also will help. Victims' families deserve information, the chief said, imploring people to call in tips on all the cases, including on the children's shootings: ""People have got to step up.""

24,https://www.aol.com/news/could-beto-back-orourke-mulling-041502831-103346454.html," AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — There’s no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But Beto O’Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats’ breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O’Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O’Rourke, who announced his run for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn’t ruled out anything, but isn't saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. “Impatience is not the word for it,"" Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. “But anxious is.” For months, O'Rourke has kept his options open. A top aide to the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate said O'Rouke, 48, has not ruled out challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 but has taken no formal steps toward a campaign, like calling donors or recruiting staff. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations more freely. If O'Rourke jumped in, it would be his third straight election cycle as a candidate, following his narrow loss for U.S. Senate in 2018 and failed White House run last year. A comeback in Texas could be complicated by liberal positions he took while seeking the presidency, but likely no other Democrat would enter the governor's race with the same ability to quickly raise the massive campaign funds needed to compete in the state. There is no timeline on a decision, according to the aide, who said O'Rourke only recently has been able to think more about running now that he's finished teaching virtual classes at two Texas universities. For one he led a seminar on the struggle for voting rights — O'Rourke's most visible cause lately, as state lawmakers are set to approve a sweeping bill that would restrict polling hours and reduce options to cast a ballot. 'These jokers can't even keep the lights on' Texas is the last big battleground in the GOP's nationwide campaign to impose new voting restrictions, driven by former President Donald Trump's false claims that the election was stolen from him. That fight is the latest way O'Rourke has remained an out-front presence, following the coronavirus pandemic and February's catastrophic freeze and blackouts across much of Texas that killed more than 150 people. He hasn't let up on Abbott, who is expected to seek a third term. “These jokers can't even keep the lights on, or the heat on, or the the water on when the temperature drops. Now they want to take away our election?"" O'Rourke told protesters this month at the Texas Capitol. The decision facing O'Rourke comes at a dark moment for Texas Democrats, even by the standards of a hapless 25 years of getting clobbered in statewide elections and steamrolled in the Legislature. For one, they are still wobbling after their massive expectations for a 2020 breakthrough flopped spectacularly. The party had hoped to flip the Texas House and O'Rourke led a massive campaign to do just that, but failed to give Democrats a single extra seat. The Election Day wipeout emboldened Texas Republicans, who have responded by muscling through staunchly conservative measures over guns, abortion and teaching curriculum that Democrats are all but powerless to stop. Any Texas Democrat running for governor faces long odds against the well-funded Abbott, who could ultimately face a stiffer challenge from actor Matthew McConaughey and his musings about joining the race himself. Still, O'Rourke went from virtual unknown to nearly upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, and relishes the role of underdog. While weighing his presidential run in early 2019, O’Rourke briefly grew a beard. He hit the road and wrote long, quasi-philosophical blog posts. When he did finally announce, it coincided with the Vanity Fair cover, which proved more memorable than most of his time actually campaigning. 'If anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him' Hinojosa said he encouraged O'Rourke to consider running for governor after last year's letdown for Democrats. He said he's itching for an answer because the current hole at the top of the ticket is keeping others in the party sidelined for 2022 until they know whether there will be a strong gubernatorial candidate who could boost their own chances downballot. “I told him that I thought that we needed a strong candidate for governor and he certainly fit that mold, and that, in my opinion, if anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him,"" Hinojosa said of his conversation with O'Rourke. Republicans who already hold massive advantages statewide are looking to extend their territory along the Texas-Mexico border, historically a Democratic stronghold, which swung heavily toward Trump in November. In Webb County, which includes Laredo, Trump cut in half his vote deficit from 2016. Sylvia Bruni, the county's Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O'Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O'Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” That kind of comment isn't forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where “your guns are more important than your wife.” In April, O'Rourke drove 600 miles to Laredo to knock on doors and canvass for new voters. Bruni registered another 256 new voters Thursday at a high school, and worries the election bill heading to Abbott's desk will make casting their first ballot harder. “No one else has surfaced,” she said of Democrats' non-O'Rourke prospects for governor. “I haven't seen anyone out there.”",2021-05-24 06:33:46,Could Beto be back?

Protasevich's popular social media Telegram channel Nexta exposed Belarusian police brutality during the anti-government demonstrations last year. As he was being led away, he reportedly said, ""I'll get the death penalty here."" 2 The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas held for a third day on Sunday as Egyptian mediators shuttled between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas. Mediators also talked to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank. Lynn Hastings, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said the U.N. would appeal for aid to rebuild parts of Gaza damaged in the worst fighting in years, which left a dozen Israelis and more than 230 Palestinians dead. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on ABC's This Week that President Biden remained committed to a two-state solution, ""so that Israelis and Palestinians can live with equal measures of security, of peace, and of dignity."" 3 Three researchers at China's Wuhan Institute of Virology went to hospitals in November 2019 ""with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illness,"" according to a previously undisclosed U.S. intelligence report cited in a Wall Street Journal report on Sunday. The details went beyond the content of a State Department fact sheet released near the end of former President Donald Trump's administration. The disclosure was expected to intensify pressure for a more complete investigation of whether the COVID-19 pandemic was started by a virus that escaped the lab. Current and former government officials who have seen the intelligence about the lab researchers disagreed about the strength of the evidence. The Wuhan Institute still hasn't shared raw data or lab records about its studies on coronavirus in bats. 4 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine safety group said Sunday that it was investigating reports of heart problems in a very small number of teenagers and young adults who received coronavirus vaccines. The agency said the ""relatively few"" cases in question might not be related to vaccination. The condition, myocarditis, is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can occur after certain infections. ""It may simply be a coincidence that some people are developing myocarditis after vaccination,"" said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. ""It's more likely for something like that to happen by chance, because so many people are getting vaccinated right now."" 5 Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Sunday that the five Republican presidents he has worked for wouldn't ""recognize the Republican Party today."" The values and the principles the GOP ""stood for under those five presidents are hard to find these days,"" Gates told John Dickerson, host of CBS's Face the Nation. Dickerson asked Gates about the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and the rejection of the November election results by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. Gates praised Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who was recently ousted from a GOP leadership post for speaking out against Trump's election fraud claims, calling her courageous and saying few elected Republicans really believe the election was stolen. 6 The death toll from a cable-car accident in northern Italy rose to at least 14 on Sunday. The lone survivor was a young child who was hospitalized in serious condition and being treated for broken bones. The cable car was carrying visitors to a mountaintop with views of the popular, picturesque Lake Maggiore when a cable apparently broke, sending the car plummeting about 50 feet to the ground among pine trees near the summit of Mottarone peak. ""It was a terrible, terrible scene,"" said Marcella Severino, mayor of Stresa, where the accident occurred. Six of those killed were Israeli citizens. The Italian government said a commission would investigate the accident, which was expected to renew debate over the state of Italy's transportation infrastructure. 7 Rhode Island has become the eighth U.S state where 70 percent of the adult population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, CNN reported Sunday, citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont also have reached the milestone. Twenty-five states and Washington, D.C., have fully vaccinated at least half of their adults. The number of new cases nationwide has fallen below 30,000 per day for the first time since June 2020. Deaths also have dropped to rates not seen since last summer. The improvement has come along with progress in the U.S. vaccination push. Nearly half of Americans have received at least one dose. 8 At least two people were killed and 12 others wounded in a mass shooting at a family house party in Cumberland County, New Jersey, late Saturday night. ""No arrests have been made, and the motive and incident remain under investigation,"" New Jersey State Police posted on Facebook. Hundreds of guests of all ages were reportedly at the party. Neighbors reported hearing several gunshots in rapid succession, and that partygoers ran through their yards and asked to take refuge in their houses. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) called the shooting ""horrific"" in a statement Sunday, and said ""this despicable and cowardly act of gun violence only steels our commitment to ensuring New Jersey leads the nation in passing and enforcing gun laws."" 9 Lava from an unexpected volcanic eruption killed at least 15 people in eastern Congo villages and destroyed more than 500 homes, officials and witnesses said Sunday. Aline Bichikwebo escaped her village with her baby, but she said mother and father died when the family's home burned up in the lava flow. ""I am asking for help because everything we had is gone,"" she said. Tens of thousands of people fled the city of Goma after Mount Nyiragongo erupted on Saturday night, UNICEF said. More than 170 children were feared missing. ""People are still panicking and are hungry,"" resident Alumba Sutoye said. ""They don't even know where they are going to spend the night."" Goma, which was devastated the last time the volcano erupted in 2002, was spared extensive damage. Hundreds died in the previous eruption, and more than 100,000 were left homeless. 10 Phil Mickelson won the 2021 PGA Championship on Sunday, becoming the oldest golfer to win a major tournament. Mickelson, 50, won by two shots, leaving Louis Oosthuizen and Brooks Kopeka tied for second. The previous record for oldest major winner was held by Julius Boros, who won the 1968 PGA Championship when he was 48 years, 4 months, and 18 days old. Mickelson has now won six major championships. He won his last major title in 2013. As he played the final hole, fans in the packed gallery shouted his name. The cheering crowd flocked to him after he landed his approach shot on the green with a two-shot lead and victory assured. ""It's an incredible experience. I've never had something like that,"" Mickelson said. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

26,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/24/could-beto-be-back-orourke-mulling-bid-for-texas-governor/,"Trending: By PAUL J. WEBER and WILL WEISSERT AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — There’s no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But Beto O’Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats’ breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O’Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O’Rourke, who teased an announcement of his bid for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn’t ruled out anything, but isn’t saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. “Impatience is not the word for it,” Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. “But anxious is.” For months, O’Rourke has kept his options open. A top aide to the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate said O’Rouke, 48, has not ruled out challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 but has taken no formal steps toward a campaign, like calling donors or recruiting staff. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations more freely. If O’Rourke jumped in, it would be his third straight election cycle as a candidate, following his narrow loss for U.S. Senate in 2018 and failed White House run last year. A comeback in Texas could be complicated by liberal positions he took while seeking the presidency, but likely no other Democrat would enter the governor’s race with the same ability to quickly raise the massive campaign funds needed to compete in the state. There is no timeline on a decision, according to the aide, who said O’Rourke only recently has been able to think more about running now that he’s finished teaching virtual classes at two Texas universities. For one he led a seminar on the struggle for voting rights — O’Rourke’s most visible cause lately, as state lawmakers are set to approve a sweeping bill that would restrict polling hours and reduce options to cast a ballot. Texas is the last big battleground in the GOP’s nationwide campaign to impose new voting restrictions, driven by former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen from him. That fight is the latest way O’Rourke has remained an out-front presence, following the coronavirus pandemic and February’s catastrophic freeze and blackouts across much of Texas that killed more than 150 people. He hasn’t let up on Abbott, who is expected to seek a third term. “These jokers can’t even keep the lights on, or the heat on, or the the water on when the temperature drops. Now they want to take away our election?” O’Rourke told protesters this month at the Texas Capitol. The decision facing O’Rourke comes at a dark moment for Texas Democrats, even by the standards of a hapless 25 years of getting clobbered in statewide elections and steamrolled in the Legislature. For one, they are still wobbling after their massive expectations for a 2020 breakthrough flopped spectacularly. The party had hoped to flip the Texas House and O’Rourke led a massive campaign to do just that, but failed to give Democrats a single extra seat. The Election Day wipeout emboldened Texas Republicans, who have responded by muscling through staunchly conservative measures over guns, abortion and teaching curriculum that Democrats are all but powerless to stop. Any Texas Democrat running for governor faces long odds against the well-funded Abbott, who could ultimately face a stiffer challenge from actor Matthew McConaughey and his musings about joining the race himself. Still, O’Rourke went from virtual unknown to nearly upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, and relishes the role of underdog. While weighing his presidential run in early 2019, O’Rourke briefly grew a beard. He hit the road and wrote long, quasi-philosophical blog posts. When he did finally announce, it coincided with the Vanity Fair cover, which proved more memorable than most of his time actually campaigning. Hinojosa said he encouraged O’Rourke to consider running for governor after last year’s letdown for Democrats. He said he’s itching for an answer because the current hole at the top of the ticket is keeping others in the party sidelined for 2022 until they know whether there will be a strong gubernatorial candidate who could boost their own chances downballot. “I told him that I thought that we needed a strong candidate for governor and he certainly fit that mold, and that, in my opinion, if anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him,” Hinojosa said of his conversation with O’Rourke. Republicans who already hold massive advantages statewide are looking to extend their territory along the Texas-Mexico border, historically a Democratic stronghold, which swung heavily toward Trump in November. In Webb County, which includes Laredo, Trump cut in half his vote deficit from 2016. Sylvia Bruni, the county’s Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O’Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O’Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” That kind of comment isn’t forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where “your guns are more important than your wife.” In April, O’Rourke drove 600 miles to Laredo to knock on doors and canvass for new voters. Bruni registered another 256 new voters Thursday at a high school, and worries the election bill heading to Abbott’s desk will make casting their first ballot harder. “No one else has surfaced,” she said of Democrats’ non-O’Rourke prospects for governor. “I haven’t seen anyone out there.” ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

28,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/24/there-were-at-least-12-mass-shootings-across-the-us-this-weekend/,"Trending: A series of mass shootings over the weekend left at least 11 people dead and another 69 injured. There were at least 12 mass shootings between Friday night and Sunday, according to CNN reporting and an analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), local media and police reports. The shootings took place across eight states — Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Minnesota. CNN defines a mass shooting as an incident with four or more people killed or wounded by gunfire — excluding the shooter. So far this year, more than 7,500 people have died from gun violence across the US, according to the GVA. There’s also been a 23% uptick in deaths from gun violence this year, the archive said. Here’s a look at the shootings that took place over the weekend. Chicago Police are investigating a shooting that left four men injured Sunday afternoon in the city’s West Side. The men, ages 20 to 41, were “near the outside of a residence when they heard shots and felt pain,” an incident report from the police department’s website said. Three of the men are in good condition while the fourth, who is 41, was struck multiple times and is in critical condition, according to the report. Detectives are investigating the shooting and no suspects are in custody, the report said. Just 35 miles south of Chicago, violence erupted at a private event in Park Forest, Illinois, early Sunday morning, according to police. Police responded to a celebration event at a theater shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday morning, according to a Park Forest Police Department news release. The initial investigation into the shooting indicates a physical altercation took place inside the business and the shooting took place shortly after. Officers responded to the scene and paramedics took three injured adults to a local hospital. A fourth injured adult took themselves to the hospital, the release said. Two of the four shot sustained serious injuries, according to the release, but none of the injuries are life threatening. Police believe there was more than one firearm involved in the shooting. The investigation is active and police do not have a suspect, the release said. Three people were killed and at least three others were injured in a shooting at an Ohio bar early Sunday morning, according to the Youngstown Police Department. Officers were called to the Torch Club Bar & Grille in Youngstown shortly after 2 a.m. after reports of a shooting, police said. Victims were taken to St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital. Police did not know the conditions of the victims. No details were released on any possible suspects, and the motive was not immediately clear. One person is dead and three were injured in an early morning shooting at an apartment complex in Fort Wayne, Indiana, according to city police. Gunfire was still going off when officers arrived at the apartment complex around 12:45 a.m. Sunday, police said. After checking apartments that were hit by gunfire, police said they found three people with life-threatening injuries and one with non-life threatening injuries. There appears to have been some sort of disturbance between multiple shooters in the parking lot of the complex, police said. The shooting victims were hit by stray bullets from the activity in the parking lot. All victims were taken to nearby hospitals and one victim was later pronounced dead, police said. One person remains in life-threatening condition and the conditions of the two others are not life-threatening, according to police. Authorities did not release the identities of the victims. Police officers in Norfolk responded to a shooting early Sunday morning, according to a tweet from the agency. Four adults were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds. The wounds were non-life threatening, Norfolk Police said. Investigators are asking anyone with information to submit a tip or call. Five people were injured in a shooting at a large gathering in Paterson, New Jersey, early Sunday morning, according to a statement from Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia M. Valdes and Paterson Police Chief Ibrahim Baycora. Police found three people injured after responding to a report of shots fired. Two other people who were involved in the same shooting also sought treatment at a local hospital, the statement said. A 26-year-old man is in critical condition and the other victims sustained non-fatal gunshot wounds, according to the statement. The Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office asks anyone with additional information about the shooting to reach out. A 16-year-old girl was killed and five others were injured in a shooting late Saturday night at Bicentennial Park in Columbus, Ohio, police said. Officers responded to reports of a shooting shortly before midnight and found “numerous victims,” according to a police report shared on Twitter by Columbus Police. One victim, the 16-year-old girl, was taken to a local hospital where she died shortly after 1 a.m., police said. Five others were also taken to local hospitals, police said. They are all are expected to survive. Two victims — a 16-year-old boy and a 19-year-old woman — were treated at Ohio State University Hospital Wexner Medical Center. One victim, described only as a “juvenile,” was treated at Children’s Hospital for gunshot injuries. A 19-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man were also treated at nearby undisclosed hospitals. A house party in Cumberland County, New Jersey, packed with hundreds of guests devolved into chaos when gunfire erupted, killing at least two people and wounding a dozen more. A man and a woman were killed in the shooting, police said, and at least 12 more people were shot in the melee on East Commerce Street in Fairfield Township around 11:50 p.m. Saturday. Cooper University Hospital in Camden said it received six victims from a shooting at a home in Cumberland County. It’s not clear how many victims in total were taken from the scene to area hospitals. No arrests have been made as of Sunday, according to a New Jersey State Police Facebook post. A shooting at an unauthorized concert in North Charleston, South Carolina, late Saturday night left a 14-year-old dead and 13 others wounded, police said. Officers responded to the area of Piggly Wiggly Drive and West Jimtown Drive in reference to a shooting at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday and found numerous victims with gunshot wounds, North Charleston Police Deputy Chief Scott Deckard said. The victims were treated and taken to local hospitals. Several additional victims were located at area hospitals after being transported by others. Deckard said a fight broke out near the concert stage prior to the shooting. Police had no information about a possible suspect or suspects. A 5-year-old boy was one of four people injured in a shooting at a Texas sports complex in San Angelo Saturday, San Angelo Police Department spokesperson Tracy Piatt-Fox told CNN. “Just before 9pm, San Angelo Public Safety Communications received multiple 9-1-1 calls concerning shots fired at the Texas Bank Sports Complex located at 1800 Rio Concho Drive,” Piatt-Fox said. The three adults and child were treated for minor injures, she said. A suspect was taken into custody and an investigation is ongoing. San Angelo is about 200 miles west of Waco. There were at least nine gunshot victims, including one man who died, after a shooting in downtown Minneapolis early Saturday morning, police said. Two people were standing in a crowded area on North First Avenue when they argued, pulled out guns and began shooting at each other, according to police. Officers working “evening bar close” heard the gunshots and ran toward the gunfire, police said. They arrived at an “exceptionally chaotic scene” where two men had already died from their injuries. Jawan Contrail Carroll, 23, was arrested in Bloomington, Minnesota, on probable cause of murder and taken to the Hennepin County Jail, Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) spokesperson John Elder told CNN Saturday evening. Police believe the second shooter was among those killed. The names of the victims as well as the nature and cause of death will be released by the medical examiner in the coming days, police said in a statement.

Two people were standing in a crowded area on North First Avenue when they argued, pulled out guns and began shooting at each other, according to police. Officers working “evening bar close” heard the gunshots and ran toward the gunfire, police said. They arrived at an “exceptionally chaotic scene” where two men had already died from their injuries. Jawan Contrail Carroll, 23, was arrested in Bloomington, Minnesota, on probable cause of murder and taken to the Hennepin County Jail, Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) spokesperson John Elder told CNN Saturday evening. Police believe the second shooter was among those killed. The names of the victims as well as the nature and cause of death will be released by the medical examiner in the coming days, police said in a statement.

30,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/24/for-better-and-worse-holding-political-town-halls-online-isnt-going-away/,"Trending: Politicians haven’t been kissing many babies of late, but some Orange County Congress members have been holding more town halls than ever, trying to share information about the pandemic and political issues while taking advantage of the convenience — and marketing reach — that comes with virtual meetings. From the politician’s view, virtual town halls have their perks, starting with the fact that anybody, in any district, can tune in without changing out of their pajamas. In April 2020, a virtual event hosted by Rep. Katie Porter, D-Irvine, drew more than 100,000 people. Pre-pandemic, Porter’s biggest live audience had been a space-limited 400. But technology also can bring challenges. On May 18, Rep. Young Kim, R-La Habra, held a telephone town hall (her third since taking office in January) where residents who pre-registered to “attend” were supposed to get a call connecting them as the event went live. Instead, many phones never rang.  A spokesperson for Kim said her office is looking into what went wrong and working with their phone session vendor to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Now that COVID-19 vaccines are readily available, with case numbers declining and restrictions easing, some residents are pushing for their elected representatives to return to in-person town halls. “The people want to be able to confront or ‘press the flesh’ with their member,” said Fred Smoller, political science professor at Chapman University. “This is very much a part of American democracy.” Porter’s team is planning their first in-person town hall since the pandemic started. If health conditions remain favorable, the plan is to hold it outdoors this summer. And other local representatives said they’re evaluating face-to-face options as health guidelines change. But in surveying local representatives, it’s clear that at least some virtual town halls are here to stay. “The pandemic has certainly changed the way we think about doing such events as so many people have become comfortable during the pandemic with using video streaming technology — an acceptance that was not there prior to the pandemic,” said Keith Higginbotham, spokesman for Rep. Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach. “I think the future will likely be a hybrid of in-person and virtual events,” he added. “The virtual meeting has now become just another of the tools available for the congressman to connect with his constituents.” Voters meeting face-to-face with elected officials, in some way, has been expectation since America took shape. But Smoller said the specific expectation that elected officials regularly hold town halls — with some lawmakers touting how many they’ve held and some challengers calling out incumbents for not having enough — is a relatively new phenomenon. “It appears to have become almost a requirement of public office to do these things,” Smoller said. When a slate of Democrats campaigned to flip four Orange County House seats in 2018, one of their talking points was how some of the longtime GOP incumbents who’d represented those districts did not regularly hold town halls. “Our retiring member of Congress, Darrell Issa, held three town hall meetings in the last decade,” Mike Levin tweeted in April 2018, as the ran for CA-49. “I’ll hold at least one town hall a month. You deserve a member of Congress who keeps showing up.” Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, has exceeded that pledge. Since taking office in January, 2019, Levin has held 74 town halls, a rate of 2.5 town halls a month, the highest of all House members representing Orange County. “When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, he immediately increased the frequency of his town halls and had local public health experts join him to ensure constituents had all of the information they needed to stay safe and healthy,” said Eric Mee, Levin’s spokesman. As of Friday, May 21, Levin had held 15 in-person events, which also were live-streamed via Facebook, and 59 virtual town halls. He’s often accompanied by guests to talk discuss topics ranging from the pandemic to systemic racism to climate change. He also records his town halls and puts them out as a podcast available on several major platforms. Porter has hosted 48 town halls, including 33 virtual events that have been done via a mix of telephone, Zoom and social media. Rep. Lou Correa, D-Anaheim, has hosted 46 town halls since January 2019, with 25 held virtually over the past year. Thousands tuned in to some of the pandemic-related virtual town halls, he said, while a recent event, about taxation, drew only a few dozen people. Correa said he held some virtual meetings even before the pandemic. “For many working people, it can be hard to make an in-person event. By live streaming and recording our events, we hope to make them more accessible to more people.” Lowenthal has had eight official town halls over the past two years, seven virtually. Most averaged around 300 participants, while one drew more than 1,000 residents, nearly matching the biggest in-person audience he’s drawn during his nine years in Congress. The biggest, he said, was an 1,100-person town hall he held in 2016, following the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Whittier, whose 38th District includes a sliver of north Orange County, has had more than 30 events in the past two years, a combination of town halls, small group meetings and other events, to directly engage with voters, spokesman Michael Cummings said. Her most recent event was a tele-town hall with L.A. County leaders to discuss COVID-19 relief for Southern California. Cummings said more than 4,000 people dialed in. Freshman GOP Rep. Michelle Steel held her first town hall as a telephone event on May 13. Steel shared some of her priorities in the House, including sand replacement on local beaches, fighting high-speed rail and repealing the cap on state and local tax deductions. She also took 21 questions from the more than 2,000 residents who were on the hour-long call. Of course, town halls aren’t the only way representatives connect with residents. And Smoller said some lawmakers clearly excel at and enjoy such scenarios more than others do. Lowenthal, for example, focuses on regular coffee events with smaller groups of residents. “He appreciates the added intimacy of smaller group meetings and believes it allows better back and forth between himself and the audience,” Higginbotham said. Pandemic issues aside, House members and their representatives say public events can come with safety concerns. Those fears, they note, spiked after former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Arizona, was shot during a 2011 community event and have continued as interest groups have become adept at using social media to coordinate ambushes over hyper-partisan issues. Such confrontations have forced Correa to ask for uniformed police to attend in-person events. “I represent a diverse community and welcome the many different views that come with that. But efforts to hijack in-person events make it difficult to hold public events,” he said. “I want to hear from everyone. Sadly, we have individuals disrupting our events, and we must now have police officers present at many of our events to ensure a civil and safe environment for all.” Virtual events also can be arranged faster than in-person events and can address timely topics, which Higginbotham pointed at as a perk. But virtual formats, such as telephone meet-ups, can cost a couple thousand dollars to arrange, making them much more expensive than a traditional, in-person town hall. There’s also the advantage — and the fear — that comes with modern information gathering. At in-person town halls, attendees are often encouraged — though rarely required — to give over an email address or a phone number. But for virtual events, representatives on both sides of the aisle collect emails or phone numbers as requirements for attendance, typically with a note that the information will be used by the lawmaker to issue future updates. Most local lawmakers said they rely on existing email and newsletter lists, plus social media, to promote town hall events. Porter’s office noted they also reach out to community partners when town halls touch on topics of specific interests. To publicize a town hall about stopping Asian American and Pacific Islander hate, for example, Porter’s office reached out to local AAPI faith groups and advocacy organizations, according to Porter spokesman Jordan Wong. The office also has advertised town halls on local TV and via traditional mail. Some virtual town halls include notices that they’re only open to district residents. But online registration forms don’t filter out non-residents. And during Steel’s recent telephone town hall, she took a question from someone in Santa Ana, which isn’t entirely in her CA-48 district. That’s another difference between live and virtual town halls; it’s easier to screen questions from the audience — and potentially silence critics — virtually. Levin does not screen questions for in-person town halls, for example, but his spokesman Mee said technical limitations of virtual meetings require that he collect questions in advance. Correa said he never screens questions. “I represent everyone in my district and believe everyone deserves to be heard.” One of Porter’s trademarks during in-person town halls was to have attendees write their questions on note cards and put them in a bingo ball spinner, so that the issues she dealt with in public were not biased by who raises their hand the fastest or jumps up and down the highest — lessons she learned from her years as a professor at UC Irvine. But virtual town halls are different. “With digital events, where anyone from across the country can attend,” Wong said, “we have to screen questions to prioritize constituents.” Lowenthal doesn’t screen questions in the sense of picking only easy issues or questions that fit a certain narrative, Higginbotham said. But while most in-person events simply feature an open microphone, available to any resident, virtual town halls sometimes require that questions be collected in advance and batched together so they can get to as many as possible in the given time-frame. While virtual events have their problems, Smoller said their popularity during the pandemic proves that residents do still turn to their congress members for guidance about important issues. And, because of that, he doesn’t see virtual town halls going away anytime soon. This story has been updated to reflect that a portion of Santa Ana is in the 48th District.

31,https://www.dailynews.com/2021/05/24/could-beto-be-back-orourke-mulling-bid-for-texas-governor/,"Trending: By PAUL J. WEBER and WILL WEISSERT AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — There’s no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But Beto O’Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats’ breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O’Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O’Rourke, who teased an announcement of his bid for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn’t ruled out anything, but isn’t saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. “Impatience is not the word for it,” Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. “But anxious is.” For months, O’Rourke has kept his options open. A top aide to the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate said O’Rouke, 48, has not ruled out challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 but has taken no formal steps toward a campaign, like calling donors or recruiting staff. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations more freely. If O’Rourke jumped in, it would be his third straight election cycle as a candidate, following his narrow loss for U.S. Senate in 2018 and failed White House run last year. A comeback in Texas could be complicated by liberal positions he took while seeking the presidency, but likely no other Democrat would enter the governor’s race with the same ability to quickly raise the massive campaign funds needed to compete in the state. There is no timeline on a decision, according to the aide, who said O’Rourke only recently has been able to think more about running now that he’s finished teaching virtual classes at two Texas universities. For one he led a seminar on the struggle for voting rights — O’Rourke’s most visible cause lately, as state lawmakers are set to approve a sweeping bill that would restrict polling hours and reduce options to cast a ballot. Texas is the last big battleground in the GOP’s nationwide campaign to impose new voting restrictions, driven by former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen from him. That fight is the latest way O’Rourke has remained an out-front presence, following the coronavirus pandemic and February’s catastrophic freeze and blackouts across much of Texas that killed more than 150 people. He hasn’t let up on Abbott, who is expected to seek a third term. “These jokers can’t even keep the lights on, or the heat on, or the the water on when the temperature drops. Now they want to take away our election?” O’Rourke told protesters this month at the Texas Capitol. The decision facing O’Rourke comes at a dark moment for Texas Democrats, even by the standards of a hapless 25 years of getting clobbered in statewide elections and steamrolled in the Legislature. For one, they are still wobbling after their massive expectations for a 2020 breakthrough flopped spectacularly. The party had hoped to flip the Texas House and O’Rourke led a massive campaign to do just that, but failed to give Democrats a single extra seat. The Election Day wipeout emboldened Texas Republicans, who have responded by muscling through staunchly conservative measures over guns, abortion and teaching curriculum that Democrats are all but powerless to stop. Any Texas Democrat running for governor faces long odds against the well-funded Abbott, who could ultimately face a stiffer challenge from actor Matthew McConaughey and his musings about joining the race himself. Still, O’Rourke went from virtual unknown to nearly upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, and relishes the role of underdog. While weighing his presidential run in early 2019, O’Rourke briefly grew a beard. He hit the road and wrote long, quasi-philosophical blog posts. When he did finally announce, it coincided with the Vanity Fair cover, which proved more memorable than most of his time actually campaigning. Hinojosa said he encouraged O’Rourke to consider running for governor after last year’s letdown for Democrats. He said he’s itching for an answer because the current hole at the top of the ticket is keeping others in the party sidelined for 2022 until they know whether there will be a strong gubernatorial candidate who could boost their own chances downballot. “I told him that I thought that we needed a strong candidate for governor and he certainly fit that mold, and that, in my opinion, if anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him,” Hinojosa said of his conversation with O’Rourke. Republicans who already hold massive advantages statewide are looking to extend their territory along the Texas-Mexico border, historically a Democratic stronghold, which swung heavily toward Trump in November. In Webb County, which includes Laredo, Trump cut in half his vote deficit from 2016. Sylvia Bruni, the county’s Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O’Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O’Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” That kind of comment isn’t forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where “your guns are more important than your wife.” In April, O’Rourke drove 600 miles to Laredo to knock on doors and canvass for new voters. Bruni registered another 256 new voters Thursday at a high school, and worries the election bill heading to Abbott’s desk will make casting their first ballot harder. “No one else has surfaced,” she said of Democrats’ non-O’Rourke prospects for governor. “I haven’t seen anyone out there.” ___ Weissert reported from Washington.

News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit May 24, 2021 | 11:57am				| Updated May 24, 2021 | 5:10pm A suspect in a mass shooting outside a Minneapolis nightclub that left two people dead, including one just about to graduate college, has been arrested, police said. Jowan Contrail Carroll, 24, was arrested in Bloomington Saturday afternoon on probable cause of murder in the shooting near Monarch nightclub, Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said Monday. Carroll had not been formally charged as of early Monday but police have until noon Tuesday to file formal counts against him. Investigators believe Carroll and a second shooter — who was killed in the gunfire and had yet to be identified Monday — “got into a verbal altercation” outside the downtown Minneapolis nightclub and started shooting at each other, police said in a statement. Ten people in all were shot, police told the Star Tribune on Saturday. The 10 adult victims were five women and five men, police said. The second suspect’s identity will be released by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office, Elder said. One victim remained in critical condition early Monday, while seven others had non-life-threatening injuries, Elder told The Post. Also killed in the carnage was Charlie Johnson, a mechanical engineering major who was set to graduate from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul later that day, university officials announced Saturday. “Our community is shocked and saddened by the news of Charlie’s death,” University of St. Thomas president Julie Sullivan said. “On a day he and his family should have been celebrating his graduation from our School of Engineering, we are devastated by this loss.” Johnson was recognized at the school’s three commencement ceremonies later Saturday while a relative accepted a diploma on his behalf, university officials said. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo characterized the shooting as a “brazen, senseless” act of gun violence. “The perpetrators of these crimes should never find refuge or anonymity in our communities,” the chief said in a statement Saturday. “Minneapolis police officers will continue to rush into harm’s way to save lives, however we need help from community leaders and residents to stand up and speak out denouncing loudly that they will not tolerate this violence as well.” Reps from the club, meanwhile, said the two gunmen in the shooting were not patrons of the establishment and got into a fight in an adjacent parking lot, KSTP reported. The club will remain closed until Friday, according to the station. “It’s the same thing we’ve said over and over again; bottom line is people need to put their guns down,” Elder told the Star Tribune. “It’s as simple as that. There needs to be other ways to solve differences.” Read Next Supreme Court rejects inmate's firing squad execution bid Share Selection This story has been shared 93,876 times.

Metro By Jackie Salo Submit May 24, 2021 | 12:35pm				| Updated May 24, 2021 | 1:02pm A 36-year-old man has been arrested in the New Jersey birthday party mass shooting that left two people dead and a dozen more injured, prosecutors said Monday. Kevin K. Dawkins, who lives on the same street as the party, was arrested on suspicion of unlawful possession of a weapon and other gun charges in connection to the deadly shooting at a sprawling home in Fairfield Township late Saturday, NJ.com reported. “This was not a random act of violence,” state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said during a press conference Monday morning. “This was a targeted attack.” Kevin Elliott, 30, and Asia Hester, 25, both of Bridgeton, were killed in the gunfire. The other victims range in age from 19 to 35 — and “several” remain in dire condition, prosecutors said. Dawkins was taken into custody on Sunday and booked at Cumberland County Jail. Prosecutors didn’t say whether Dawkins was a suspect in the homicides, and authorities said more people are being sought in connection to the carnage. Multiple firearms and shell casings have been recovered from the scene, prosecutors said. “We’re working with our federal partners to determine where these guns originated from, and whether they can be linked to other recent acts of violence in the area,” Grewal said. Gunfire erupted around 11:50 p.m. at the ’90s-themed bash, sending hundreds of guests frantically running for safety, police and witnesses said. “I was sitting on a chair talking to my daughter and a friend. We were laughing. Next thing I knew, I hear shots fired, like 20 shots,” attendee Sunshine Carter, 44, told The Post on Sunday. No motive has been released in the shooting, but some attendees said Sunday it might have been a turf war between groups of local young men. “It’s South Side young boys vs. North Side young boys,” one female guest told The Post. Grieving loved ones paid tribute over the weekend to Elliott, who leaves behind a child. “Everybody knows how much I love my family no matter what the streets say!!! He was also a man with a kid!!! Everybody talking about pray for my city this s–t will never stop until it’s nothing but women here raising the kids that was left behind!!!” wrote a relative, Etta Elliott, on Facebook. His brother Fantasia Elliott also mourned the loss. “My brother, my twin , like I can tell him about anything and he going to understand me… idk what to do,” he wrote on Facebook.

Amid the increased violence in the city where George Floyd was killed nearly one year ago, officials also announced a $30,000 reward this weekend in the hunt for suspects responsible for the separate shootings of three children over the past several weeks, including one 9-year-old girl killed by stray gunfire while jumping on a backyard trampoline. During the early Saturday mass shooting, two people were killed and another eight wounded after gunshots rang out just before 2 a.m. outside in the 300 block of N 1st Ave. Investigators say two men got into an argument and began firing amid a crowd gathered on the sidewalk near Monarch nightclub. One of the suspected gunmen was killed along with the college student. Another suspected shooter, a 23-year-old man, was arrested by Bloomington police Saturday afternoon and booked for probable cause murder in Hennepin County Jail, Fox 9 Minneapolis reported. BIDEN TO MISS POLICE REFORM BILL DEADLINE, MEET WITH GEORGE FLOYD'S FAMILY ON DEATH ANNIVERSARY The second fatality was University of St. Thomas student Charlie Johnson, who family say was an innocent bystander and had gone out with friends to celebrate their graduation the next day. His father, Greg Johnson, asked people to say his son’s name in the fight to end gun violence. He said Charlie, who was graduating with a mechanical engineering degree, ""left a beautiful impact on every single life he touched."" ""No politics please,"" Johnson wrote on Facebook, ""just love and compassion for each other as Charlie had for all of us. I AM CHARLIE!"" Speaking at a press conference Sunday, Mayor Jacob Frey said he requested mutual aid assistance from a number of different jurisdictions to help address the recent violence seen in the city. He said state troopers have been providing assistance from Saturday evening into Sunday morning and the Minneapolis Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is aiding the investigation. Nearly 200 Minneapolis police officers have left the force in the wake of the death of Floyd, with many filing post-traumatic stress claims due to the civil unrest that followed. Minneapolis has seen at least 31 homicides this year, not including this weekend's violence. Separate from the mass shooting, a car crash victim was found also suffering from gunshot wounds when police responded to the scene; he later died from his injuries. In another incident, as bystanders rushed a gunshot victim to the hospital, a car flipped and the medical examiner is still working to determine which injuries caused that man's death. ""Safety in our city has to be a priority,"" Frey said Sunday, calling law enforcement reinforcements ""really, really critical."" MINNEAPOLIS TO PAY $25 MILLION TO POLICE OFFICERS WHO LEFT FORCE AMID GEORGE FLOYD UNREST: REPORT Frey acknowledged that resources have had to been diverted to respond to 911 calls and has been working with City Hall on a proposal on how to build back up the police force. This, as negotiations continue on how the American Rescue Plan funding will be allocated, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. At City Hall on Sunday, officials announced a $30,000 reward for information that leads to arrests in connection to the separate shootings of three children in Minneapolis' North Side. Trinity Ottoson-Smith, 9, was shot while jumping on a trampoline in her backyard earlier this month. Ladavionne Garrett Jr., 10, and Aniya Allen, 6, both were shot in separate incidents in Minneapolis over the past two weeks. Aniya died from her injuries. The fund created by the Minneapolis Regional Chamber offers $10,000 for information in each case, KARE reported. ""We need more police officers. There is no doubt in my mind,"" Smith’s grandfather, Randy Ottoson, told the Tribune, stressing that police reform is necessary, because Black lives matter, but that shouldn’t mean less officers patrolling local communities. ""I'm praying for all of these families but, you know what, I'm praying for the next people too."" Several events are scheduled in Minneapolis this week to coincide with the first anniversary of Floyd’s death. Aniya Allen’s grandfather, K.G. Wilson, who is also a community activist, pointed out that large crowds of demonstrators have often come from out of town and shut down roadways over the past year since Floyd’s death – but similar protests have not come since in response to the deaths of these three children. Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said federal agencies are also assisting investigations. ""These perpetrators who continue to harm our angels need to turn themselves in,"" Arradondo said. ""I will work diligently, and my men and women will continue to rush into harm’s way to continue to keep our communities safe and deal with the condition of violence. But we have a condition of heart."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) had already been called in last week to assist the Minneapolis Police Department with their investigations into the three separate incidents where the children were shot, KTSP reported. Minneapolis police has seven homicide detectives working the mass shooting case, while the city's Office of Violence Prevention sent a ""very small group,"" including director Sasha Cotton, to work with families and bystanders, city spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie told the Tribune.

36,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/beto-back-orourke-mulling-bid-texas-governor-77866413,"Former Texas congressman and presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke is contemplating a new political decision AUSTIN, Texas -- There’s no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But         Beto O’Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats’ breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O’Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O’Rourke, who teased an announcement of his bid for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn’t ruled out anything, but isn't saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. “Impatience is not the word for it,"" Texas Democratic Party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said. “But anxious is.” For months, O'Rourke has kept his options open. A top aide to the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate said O'Rouke, 48, has not ruled out challenging Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 but has taken no formal steps toward a campaign, like calling donors or recruiting staff. The aide spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations more freely. If O'Rourke jumped in, it would be his third straight election cycle as a candidate, following his narrow loss for U.S. Senate in 2018 and failed White House run last year. A comeback in Texas could be complicated by liberal positions he took while seeking the presidency, but likely no other Democrat would enter the governor's race with the same ability to quickly raise the massive campaign funds needed to compete in the state. There is no timeline on a decision, according to the aide, who said O'Rourke only recently has been able to think more about running now that he's finished teaching virtual classes at two Texas universities. For one he led a seminar on the struggle for voting rights — O'Rourke's most visible cause lately, as state lawmakers are set to approve a sweeping bill that would restrict polling hours and reduce options to cast a ballot. Texas is the last big battleground in the         GOP's nationwide campaign to impose new voting restrictions, driven by former President Donald Trump's         false claims that the election was stolen from him. That fight is the latest way O'Rourke has remained an out-front presence, following the coronavirus         pandemic and February's         catastrophic freeze and blackouts across much of Texas that killed more than 150 people. He hasn't let up on Abbott, who is expected to seek a third term. “These jokers can't even keep the lights on, or the heat on, or the the water on when the temperature drops. Now they want to take away our election?"" O'Rourke told protesters this month at the Texas Capitol. The decision facing O'Rourke comes at a dark moment for Texas Democrats, even by the standards of a hapless 25 years of getting clobbered in statewide elections and steamrolled in the Legislature. For one, they are still wobbling after their massive expectations for a 2020 breakthrough flopped spectacularly. The party had hoped to flip the Texas House and O'Rourke led a massive campaign to do just that, but failed to give Democrats a single extra seat. The Election Day wipeout emboldened Texas Republicans, who have responded by muscling through staunchly conservative measures over guns, abortion and teaching curriculum that Democrats are all but powerless to stop. Any Texas Democrat running for governor faces long odds against the well-funded Abbott, who could ultimately face a stiffer challenge from actor Matthew McConaughey and         his musings about joining the race himself. Still, O'Rourke went from virtual unknown to nearly upsetting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, and relishes the role of underdog. While weighing his presidential run in early 2019, O’Rourke briefly grew a beard. He hit the road and wrote long, quasi-philosophical blog posts. When he did finally announce, it coincided with the Vanity Fair cover, which proved more memorable than most of his time actually campaigning. Hinojosa said he encouraged O'Rourke to consider running for governor after last year's letdown for Democrats. He said he's itching for an answer because the current hole at the top of the ticket is keeping others in the party sidelined for 2022 until they know whether there will be a strong gubernatorial candidate who could boost their own chances downballot. “I told him that I thought that we needed a strong candidate for governor and he certainly fit that mold, and that, in my opinion, if anybody could beat Abbott, he could beat him,"" Hinojosa said of his conversation with O'Rourke. Republicans who already hold massive advantages statewide are looking to extend their territory along the Texas-Mexico border, historically a Democratic stronghold, which swung heavily toward Trump in November. In Webb County, which includes Laredo, Trump cut in half his vote deficit from 2016. Sylvia Bruni, the county's Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O'Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O'Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” That kind of comment isn't forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where “your guns are more important than your wife.” In April, O'Rourke drove 600 miles to Laredo to knock on doors and canvass for new voters. Bruni registered another 256 new voters Thursday at a high school, and worries the election bill heading to Abbott's desk will make casting their first ballot harder. “No one else has surfaced,” she said of Democrats' non-O'Rourke prospects for governor. “I haven't seen anyone out there.” ——— Weissert reported from Washington. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-05-24 15:08:33,Beto O'Rourke mulling bid for Texas governor,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper.  Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, who spearheaded the local defund police movement, is in hot water after attempting to block the public release of records about her ""equity"" bureau, which was found to be riddled with ethics and abuse of power issues permeating its bureaucratic ranks. Hardesty was assigned in January as commissioner in charge of the Office of Community & Civic Life, which handles a range of responsibilities in Portland’s city government, including handling cannabis tax refunds and a ""racial equity plan"" with ""social justice goals"" aimed at addressing ""systemic racism"" and encouraging development within Black, indigenous, people of color, immigrant, and refugee communities, its website reads. Last year, the Portland Bureau of Human Resources and city ombudsman Margie Sollinger both received a mass of complaints from Civic Life employees. The City Attorney's Office then contracted the consulting firm ASCETA to conduct a review into the department and provide recommendations on work culture. MINNEAPOLIS POLICE SEEK FEDERAL, STATE REINFORCEMENTS AFTER MASS SHOOTING KILLS COLLEGE KID BEFORE GRADUATION The 65-page review made public last week found ""longstanding dysfunction"" passed down from previous management that has festered and developed untreated into systemic distrust. Leadership and management style were described as ""hierarchical"" and ""punitive"" in the review, which was based on interviews with about two-thirds of current Civic Life employees and a dozen former employees. Work culture involved ""toxicity"" and mass firings were common. The review found ""unquestioning loyalty is seen as rewarded and there is a perception of favoritism in management and hiring practices,"" while ""questioning and criticism is felt to be discouraged and in some cases, felt punished harshly."" Portland Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty speaks to protestors during a candlelight vigil to support Portlanders' rights to free speech and assembly at the Multnomah County Justice Center last week. 
      (Mason Trinca/Getty Images) Filings said that the complaints came from ""Caucasians and people of color, employees with long seniority as well as relatively new employees, line employees and supervisory employees."" The report also said the ""kitchen sink bureau"" often lacked clarity in its scope of work and ambiguity ensured uncertainty. Employees described having a fear of retaliation and experienced psychological trauma from working in the department, according to the review obtained by the Portland Tribune. Hardesty has been an early advocate of defunding police in Portland since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis nearly a year ago. Earlier this month, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and city council greenlighted a $3,000,000 cut to the Portland Police Bureau. According to the city’s police union, Portland has defunded its police department by approximately $30 million since June of last year. After the review was finalized in March, the City Attorney’s Office denied several public records requests from parties, including the Tribune, who had sought its release, citing attorney-client privilege. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt rejected that argument and ruled it public record on May 11. The bureau’s director, Suk Rhee, resigned on May 14. And the review ultimately recommended she and three other managers be replaced. Hours before its expected release, Hardesty issued a statement saying her office conducted meetings with current and past employees, neighborhood associations, district coalitions and others since being assigned Civic Life in January and is ""best able to help lead this bureau out of turmoil."" ""To do this, it is necessary that as a leader I am able to build trust — both with our community and employees,"" the statement said. ""I believe that I will achieve this by rebuilding a bureau more streamlined for the work ahead and investing in building a leadership team that reflects the city's core values; I look forward to the work ahead."" Ombudsman Sollinger and others have criticized Hardesty for allegedly withholding the review, accusing her of lacking the transparency needed in fixing the bureau’s issues. But Hardesty said she still disagreed with the District Attorney's decision in making its findings public. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This assessment is not an audit or performance evaluation of any individual and was intended to provide attorney client privileged information on personnel matters,"" Hardesty continued. ""Although I value the need for transparency in public spending and operations, and always intended to make available a public summary report, I am disappointed in the District Attorney's ruling as this makes publicly available what were intended to be confidential recommendations.""

Fox Nation host Nancy Grace reacts. The father of a 4-year-old Texas boy who was snatched from his Dallas home and found lying in a pool of blood says he can never forgive himself for failing to keep his son safe. Trevor Gernon issued the statement about the death of his son Cash in a more than four-minute YouTube video, posted on his sister’s account on Sunday. ""I do not wish this nightmare on any parent,"" Gernon said. ""You have no idea how hard it has been for all of us, or how hard it is to hold it together while everyone pits your family apart … all attention and time should be reserved for Cash."" Gernon said he had left twin sons, Cash and Carter, with his ex-girlfriend, Monica Sherwood, in Dallas while he moved back to Houston because he thought it was in the boys’ ""best interest to not disrupt their routine."" ""This choice I made with the best of intentions has resulted in the most horrific outcome,"" Gernon said. ""I have paid the most painful and ultimate of price for my poor judgment. And I have to live with this devastation every single day."" He added: ""I will never forgive myself. If I could I’d go back and do everything [differently].

Mindy, I am so sorry that I failed to keep him safe. That was my job as a dad, and I wasn’t able to do that. I’m sorry."" Monica Sherrod, the ex-girlfriend of the children's father, previously told reporters that Gernon had left Dallas after being ordered by a court to go to rehab, the New York Post reported. Gernon said he has ""to fear for my freedom, as it is the goal of some to see me go to jail rather than grieve the loss of my little boy."" Police said Sherrod identified the person who took Cash Gernon from his bed at around 5 a.m. Saturday, May 15, as 18-year-old Darriynn Brown.

The obvious electoral disaster ahead hasn’t stopped Democrats in the Lone Star State from attempting to draft Robert “Beto” O’Rourke for a gubernatorial bid, though. The Associated Press reports this morning that O’Rourke is giving it serious consideration, despite running to the hard Left in the presidential primary in 2019: There’s no road trip, no soul searching. No beard or blogging. But Beto O’Rourke is making a political life decision again. Three years after becoming Democrats’ breakout star out of Texas, and a year removed from crashing back to Earth in a short-lived presidential run, O’Rourke is again weighing another campaign — this time for governor. But now O’Rourke, who teased an announcement of his bid for the White House on the cover of Vanity Fair, is being quiet about it. He says he hasn’t ruled out anything, but isn’t saying much else. And Texas Democrats are itching for an answer. They’re banking on Beto being seen as a serious statewide contender after his near-miss against Ted Cruz, and especially after his short-lived presidential campaign. National media outlets gave O’Rourke obsequious coverage, framing the Beto presidential narrative as a second coming of a Kennedy, although not exactly specifying why. That’s where O’Rourke made his most infamous remark of the campaign, one party chair admits: Sylvia Bruni, the county’s Democratic Party chairwoman, said she hopes O’Rourke runs but knows his presidential bid could hurt his chances. O’Rourke remade his campaign after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso in August 2019 and during one debate even made a full-throated call on national TV for confiscating assault rifles, saying “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” That kind of comment isn’t forgotten easily in Laredo, which Bruni describes tongue-in-cheek as an area where “your guns are more important than your wife.” That kind of comment is tough to live down anywhere in Texas, at least outside of Austin. The state legislature is still working on a constitutional-carry bill that might push the limit of firearms popularity in the state, but even the opposition to that isn’t offering confiscation as an alternative policy. Put that together with O’Rourke’s other peccadilloes and lack of any executive track record in the public sector, and this begins to look like a desperation move. Bruni more or less confirms this impression: “No one else has surfaced,” she said of Democrats’ non-O’Rourke prospects for governor. “I haven’t seen anyone out there.” Texas Democrats might not have much else out there, The Hill notes, and have other problems at the moment than just a gun-grabbing nominee at the top of the ticket: Following their 2020 losses, the Texas Democratic Party commissioned a retrospective of the election, eventually concluding that a lack of in-person campaigning and inadequate voter outreach amid the coronavirus pandemic played a crucial role in their defeats. Texas Democrats face new challenges in 2022. The Republican-controlled state legislature has advanced a raft of new voting measures that Democrats fear will drive down turnout and hurt their chances of winning in Texas. It’s tough to see how Democrats plan to enhance turnout by nominating a gubernatorial candidate who has already threatened to use executive authority to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens. One is tempted to say that Democrats could hardly make their situation in Texas worse after Joe Biden’s cluelessness in the border crisis, but there’s still a long way to the bottom.

News By Samuel Chamberlain Submit May 24, 2021 | 6:19pm				| Updated May 24, 2021 | 6:19pm White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that the spate of shootings over the weekend is “a gun problem” — but that the President is “implementing funding for community violence prevention programs,” to address rising crime. When asked during her daily briefing whether there is a “crime problem in this country,” Psaki answered: “I would say certainly there is a gun problem, and that’s something the president would say, and there are communities where local violence, community violence is an issue. That’s one of the reasons that we have proposed and now are implementing funding for community violence prevention programs across the country. “I will say,” Psaki added, “that we don’t often highlight … the fact that between mass shootings, mass shootings that get a lot of attention, that we lower the flags [for], there are hundreds, thousands of people who lose their lives, and that’s one of the reasons the president will continue to advocate for the Senate passing universal background checks, but also advocate for actions in states where we have seen the greatest level of activism over the past several years.” According to CNN, there were 12 mass shootings across America between Friday night and Sunday. One of those shootings happened at a Cumberland County, New Jersey house party, killing two people and injuring 12 others. In total, the 12 shootings killed 11 people and wounded 69 others. CNN defines a mass shooting as any incident in which at least four people are killed or wounded, excluding perpetrators. New York City was not exempt from weekend violence, with at least 29 people shot — one fatally — as of Sunday afternoon. The increase appears to be a continuation of the trend from 2020. A study released in February of this year that looked at crime rates in 34 cities of varying size found a 30 percent spike in homicides in 2020 compared to 2019. The study, released by the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice and Arnold Ventures, also found aggravated assaults rose 6 percent in 2020 over 2019, and gun assaults jumped 8 percent. Despite, the alarming rise in killings caused by guns, homicide rates in the U.S. have dropped sharply over the past quarter of a century. The overall homicide rate for the 34 cities studied was 11.4 deaths per 100,000 residents in 2020, compared to 19.4 deaths per 100,000 residents in 1995.

Greg Abbott on Monday. Abbott has said he would sign the bill. It would make Texas the 19th state to allow handguns to be carried without a permit, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. House Bill 1927 would allow anyone over the age of 21 who can legally possess a firearm in Texas to carry a handgun in public without a permit. Current state law allows residents 21 or older to carry a handgun only after completing the required training and criminal background check to obtain a license to carry. More: Bills targeting protesters who block roads, use fireworks or lasers sent to Abbott Republicans argued that the measure, which they often call ""constitutional carry,"" appropriately expanded gun rights under the Second Amendment. Democrats and gun safety advocates criticized the measure, which they say will increase gun violence in Texas and make it easier for criminals to obtain a gun. Rep. Matt Schaefer, a Tyler Republican and the author of the bill, praised a compromise reached between members of the House and Senate over differences in versions of the bill approved in each chamber. ""Ultimately, we came out with a bill that is strong and no doubt is the strongest restoration of Second Amendment rights that any of us have ever seen in the history of the state of Texas,"" Schaefer said. Late last night the Texas House completed its work on HB 1927. #ConstitutionalCarry is now in the capable hands of @DrSchwertner and the Texas Senate to send it to the Governor! #2A #shallnotbeinfringed #txlege The House approved the deal in a late night vote Sunday. The Senate approved the changes Monday, sending it to the governor. If Abbott signs the bill, it would go into effect on Sept. 1, 2021. Sen. Charles Schwertner, a Georgetown Republican who carried the bill in the Senate, said the bill remained strong while still handling the concerns of law enforcement officials. ""This bill, to me, again is a simple restoration of Texans' constitutional right under the Second Amendment,"" he said. Schaefer also expressed disappointment that the final bill did not leave in a House amendment by Rep. Harold Dutton Jr., D-Houston, which would have prohibited law enforcement officials from stopping a person legally carrying a handgun without cause. ""This chamber unanimously supported that amendment, and we did fight for that amendment in conference,"" Schaefer said. ""We were unable to keep it on there. I do believe that in time case law will come on our direction on that and this is something that we need to look at."" The conference committee report, created by five senators and five representatives, left in place another House priority that would allow those previously convicted of unlawfully carrying a handgun in a public place to have the conviction expunged from their record. Another House amendment left in the bill would add limited affirmative defense for those who ""just make an honest mistake"" in bringing their handgun to certain prohibited places, Schaefer said.

Dan Patrick, who presides over the Texas Senate, the chamber included a number of amendments to strengthen the measure for law enforcement, including the removal of House language that banned law enforcement officers from questioning a person solely on their possession of a handgun and stiffer penalties for illegal weapons carried by felons and family violence offenders. Much of the Senate's changes were left in the final version, including a provision that would require the Texas Department of Public Safety to create a free, online gun safety course. Business owners also can prohibit guns by posting a sign under the bill. A license to carry still will be available to Texans who want to be able to carry guns in other states that have reciprocity agreements with Texas. License holders also do not need to have a background check when purchasing guns from a store. House Democrats criticized the bill before the chamber's final approval of the compromise Sunday evening, saying the Legislature has yet to pass gun control bills in the aftermath of multiple mass shootings in the state. ""I can't imagine a worse slap in the face to all those people who have advocated, to the victims, to the families of victims,"" Rep. Chris Turner, a Grand Prairie Democrat and chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said. Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso, recalled conversations after the El Paso shooting, where Abbott and Republicans vowed to find common ground with Democrats on gun safety measures. ""I heard a lot of promises,"" he said. ""I haven't heard them since."" After back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Midland-Odessa, Abbott and Patrick expressed openness to a law that would expand background checks in private firearm sales. Following recommendations from politicians, community leaders, law enforcement, federal officials, business leaders, activists and mass shooting survivors, Abbott released an action plan that backed voluntary background checks and suggested that the Legislature consider ways to make those checks easy and affordable.

Still, the Legislature has continued to expand access to guns in Texas. Abbott and Patrick have stayed quiet on the issue of background checks since then. Even on Monday, the Texas House approved a priority gun bill by Patrick that would allow gun owners to bring their firearm into a hotel room. The House tacked on an amendment that would expand the bill to long guns, not just handguns.

44,https://nypost.com/2021/05/24/texas-to-allow-handguns-without-permit-or-background-check/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Mark Lungariello Submit May 24, 2021 | 9:03pm				| Updated May 25, 2021 | 3:15pm Texans will soon be allowed to carry handguns without a permit, background check or training. State lawmakers approved a controversial bill Monday that would lift some of the remaining gun-carry restrictions in the Lone Star State — and Gov. Greg Abbott has said he plans to sign it into law. “This is a simple restoration of Texans’ constitutional right under the Second Amendment, a right of the people to keep and bear arms,” said Republican Sen. Charles Schwertner, according to the Texas Tribune. The bill faced opposition from gun safety advocates as well as law enforcement groups, who said the changes to the law would put people in danger. “Are you aware there are a large number of families on both sides of the aisle who are literally afraid of your legislation?” Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire said, according to the Tribune. But the National Rifle Association backed the bill in the Republican-dominated legislature, saying it was “the most significant gun-rights measure” in Texas history. “A right requiring you to pay a tax or obtain a government permission slip is not a right at all,” said Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action. Texas, which already allows public carry of rifles without a license, has 1.6 million people licensed for handguns. The state has allowed handguns to be carried since 1995. There are almost two dozen other states that allow some type of unregulated handgun carry, but none have a population as large as Texas. There would be some limits on the new law if it goes into effect as expected. Federal background checks would still be required for some purchases. The law says anyone over 21 can carry a gun except those who can’t because of a violent crime conviction or who are otherwise legally barred from having a gun. Businesses can still ban guns on their property. Some El Paso lawmakers criticized the bill, coming after 23 people were shot to death at a Walmart in that city in 2019. This year’s legislative session is the first since that mass shooting, the Tribune noted. Rep. Joe Moody (D-El Paso) said community members wanted “something better.” “All they wanted was some accountability,” he said in a floor speech, according to the Tribune. “Yet here we are.” With Post wires Read Next 'I'll finish what your neighbor started you motherf--ker':...

52,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-appeared-super-pac-ad-asking-money-might-break-rules,"This article originally appeared in ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Not long after her election to Congress, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., helped raise money for a super PAC by appearing in a video ad that tests the boundaries of rules limiting fundraising by elected officials. The ad explicitly asks for money for the Stop Socialism Now PAC, an entity that can accept unlimited donations. But candidates and elected officials are not allowed to solicit contributions greater than $5,000, according to campaign finance experts. Greene made the ad with Rick Shaftan, a North Carolina-based consultant whose company also handled ads for Greene’s campaign and works with a gun activism group that has been closely aligned with the freshman lawmaker. Some Republicans have cut their ties to Shaftan over his history of racistremarks. In December, Greene appeared in several ads for the super PAC leading up to Georgia’s two Senate runoffs. “It’s time to fight back now before it’s too late,” Greene said in one of the videos. Immediately after she leaves the screen, a voice-over urges viewers to “make a contribution today.” Under federal law, candidates and elected officials cannot “solicit, receive, direct, transfer, or spend funds in connection with an election … unless the funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements” of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. Super PACs aren’t subject to those requirements, as noted in the fine print on the donation webpage referenced in the Greene ad. The statute defines “solicit” as “to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly,” that a person give money or something of value. The law says messages should be considered in context, including “the conduct of persons involved in the communication.” Legal experts differed in their assessments of whether Greene’s appearance follows the law, depending on their views of how strictly campaign finance rules should be interpreted. The Federal Election Commission, which enforces campaign finance rules, is notoriously weak. Although the commission staff looks into complaints about violations of fundraising rules, the six-member commission, which has equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans, routinely deadlocks. Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the good-government advocacy group Common Cause, said he believes the Greene ad clearly crosses the line. “This communication constitutes an illegal solicitation by a member of Congress of unlimited funds,” Ryan said. The ban on soliciting unlimited donations, he said, “becomes meaningless if a candidate can do this.” Ryan said he’s never before seen a candidate reading a super PAC’s script in an ad that explicitly asks for money. That goes further, he said, than other instances where super PACs have repurposed footage of a candidate or hosted candidates at fundraisers that people have already paid to attend. Political operatives have steadily pushed to blur the lines between candidates and their allied super PACs, which are supposed to be independent. Candidates regularly started showing up at super PAC fundraisers with the FEC’s blessing. Campaigns and super PACs are not supposed to share private information, so campaigns started publicly posting video that super PACs could use — in 2015, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign famously posted hours and hours of raw footage. The Greene ad is different because her appearance was clearly recorded specifically for the super PAC. “Even if a super PAC can accept, a federal candidate can’t solicit — that is clear and indisputable,” said Erin Chlopak of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “The whole basis for these organizations to exist is acting independently and not in coordination with federal candidates. The weaker we make that, or the lack of rules that really require such independence, then the entire premise of why they’re allowed to accept unlimited contributions falls apart.” The Greene ad doesn’t specify a $5,000 contribution limit, which experts say could have avoided the issue. “My advice would be to be very clear that a candidate is not soliciting beyond those limits,” said William Minor, a campaign finance lawyer at the firm DLA Piper. Minor said the FEC has given detailed guidance about what candidates can and can’t do in relation to fundraising events, but the only rule that addresses asking for money in ads is the blanket ban on soliciting outsize donations. Still, Jan Baran, a prominent Republican campaign finance lawyer, said he believes the ad complies with FEC rules because the solicitation for money flashes up while Greene is not on screen. She also doesn’t appear on the super PAC’s online donations page, he said. “The ad and Ms. Greene seem in compliance since there is no solicitation by Ms. Greene and no evidence direct or indirect that impermissible [federal election] funds are being solicited by using Ms. Greene’s name or likeness,” Baran said in an email. The Greene campaign and its lawyer, former Trump White House deputy counsel Stefan C. Passantino, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Shaftan hung up. His Twitter bio says, “I no longer talk to the #FakeNewsMedia or care what you write.” Greene voted to overturn the presidential election by objecting to the Electoral College results on Jan. 6, when a violent mob of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters attacked the Capitol. Georgia Democrats called for Greene to resign over her inflammatory rhetoric leading up to the insurrection. In February, the House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments for conduct such as accosting a school shooting survivor and showing support online for killing Democratic leaders. Greene said in a speech that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be executed for treason and liked a Facebook comment that suggested removing Pelosi with “a bullet to the head.” Those incidents predate Greene’s election to Congress, but while in office she has provoked fresh altercations on Capitol Hill. Freshman Democrat Cori Bush of Missouri moved her office after she said Greene and her staff “berated” and “threatened” her in response to being asked to wear masks. Greene also put up an anti-transgender sign outside her office, across the hall from a lawmaker whose daughter is transgender. Last week, Greene aggressively pursued Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., outside the House chamber, falsely accusing her of supporting terrorists. It is not clear exactly when and where the super PAC launched the ad featuring Greene. Stop Socialism Now PAC reported spending $12,000 on Dec. 4 for “digital and television advertising” against the Democratic candidates in the Senate runoffs, according to FEC disclosures. The group didn’t show up in a search of broadcast airtime by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. The super PAC posted the Greene ad that asked for money on its Facebook page on Dec. 3, logging more than 3,500 views. That ad isn’t one of the super PAC’s paid posts that show up in the social network’s voluntary disclosures of political ads. FEC disclosures don’t connect contributions to any particular ad or solicitation. But the super PAC has received several donations above the $5,000 limit that applies to regular (non-super) PACs. Cynthia B. Howalt, whose family owns a chemical manufacturing company in Greene’s district, gave $125,000 on Nov. 13. Her husband, Frederick “Chip” Howalt, told a local reporter in January that the couple wanted to increase support for Greene and oppose Republicans who didn’t vote to overturn the 2020 election. The couple didn’t respond to requests for comment. Another large donor to the super PAC was William O. Cooley, a retired land developer in West Palm Beach, who gave $10,000 on Dec. 9. He declined to comment. Greene’s extensive television ads, financed in part with her $1 million loan to her campaign, were key to her victory in the Republican primary last year. Her campaign has paid Shaftan’s firm, Neighborhood Research and Media, more than $665,000 for ads, polls, mailers, phone messages and calls, according to FEC disclosures. The super PAC paid the firm another $10,000. Shaftan’s ads for Greene’s official campaign included one simulating an explosion at an enormous Confederate monument in Stone Mountain, Georgia, as Greene says, “The socialist left won’t stop until America is destroyed.” In another ad, Greene brandishes an assault rifle and appears to blow up targets labeled “gun control” and “socialism.” Shaftan also works with a network of pro-gun groups run by brothers in Ohio named Chris, Aaron and Ben Dorr. They are also prominent allies of Greene’s. In an interview with Chris Dorr a week before the 2020 election, Greene said that if Trump lost, his supporters might resort to violence. “Once it’s gone, freedom doesn’t come back by itself — the only way you get your freedoms back is it’s earned with the price of blood,” Greene said in a video of the interview, reported by Mother Jones. “This is it. Nov. 3, freedom is on the ballot.” Greene planned to speak at a May 1 rally in Columbus, Ohio, organized by Chris Dorr, who told followers they could openly carry guns there. On the eve of the rally, the organizers called it off. Greene released a statement claiming state authorities refused to provide security for her. An Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman disputed that account, saying the police “had every intention of providing security” and had “all necessary measures in place.” Chris Dorr didn’t respond to requests for comment. In 2019, Ohio authorities investigated and decided against prosecuting him for threatening assassinations in response to the Republican governor’s proposed gun regulations. “There could be political bodies lying all over the ground,” Dorr said in an online video. “We gun owners will pull the trigger and leave the corpse for the buzzards.” Greene also touted the Dorr brothers’ American Firearms Association’s endorsement of a bill she introduced in Congress to block federal funding for any gun regulations. An article on the far-right website Breitbart said Greene’s bill was a response to an abandoned effort late last year by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to restrict equipment that makes it possible to use pistols like assault weapons. This type of weapon was later used in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting in March. In April, Greene’s campaign said it would raffle off a version of the weapon. “I’m giving away the gun that triggers the Fake News Media,” Greene said in an email to supporters. Two California men have been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly plotting to attack the Democratic Party headquarters… An Arizona judge on Thursday denied Republican senators’ motion to dismiss a lawsuit seeking records on the financial backers and… Lin Wood started the week claiming that he wasn’t subject to the jurisdiction of a Michigan federal judge considering whether… Non-members are still able to read comments, but will no longer be able to participate.

That Might Break The Rules.,,113,http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com
53,https://patriotpost.us/alexander/80127-psaki-crime-surge-a-gun-problem-2021-05-25,"The Left’s “defund police” and BLM empowerment fuels murder and mayhem. In a scripted layup question for Joe Biden’s press secretary, ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked Jen “Circle Back” Psaki about the surge in violence over the last year: “A look back over the weekend and over the last year. This past weekend, there were more than a dozen mass shooting across this country — 4,000 more people shot and killed by guns in 2020 compared to the year before. Is there a crime problem in this country?” “Shot and killed by guns,” not the violent offenders using guns and other weapons to kill. For the record, the FBI, which maintains national homicide and assault data, has no definition for “mass shooting” — and the Left is as loose with those words as it is with “assault weapon.” But there were 12 assaults this past weekend resulting in 11 deaths and 69 injuries — the vast majority of which were gang and drug related. And the unofficial homicide rate for 2020 has surged 25% over 2019. That surge is being driven by major Demo urban centers who dumped cops and funds last year. The Los Angeles Police Department cut $150 million (8% of its budget) and New York Police Department cut $1 billion (15% of its budget). Homicides were up by 36% and 45% respectively. In Minneapolis (“Minnopolice”), the epicenter of the “defund police” movement after the death of George Floyd, the  city and metro Police Department budgets were cut by $22 million, and more than 200 officers. Homicides surged 46% last year and are already up this year by 113%. (And remember that once-beautiful and safe city of Portland, where protests were allowed to flourish for months. In Portland, homicides were up 766%.) The abject stupidity of Vega’s question notwithstanding, clearly, she gave Psaki an opportunity to deflect blame for the real cause of the dramatic surge in homicides and assaults in Demo-controlled urban centers — leftists’ deadly “defund the police” advocacy and their empowerment of the violent Marxist so-called “Black Lives Matter” movement. Both of those strategies were designed to foment violence in order to blame Donald Trump ahead of last year’s election. Psaki responded: “I would say certainly there is a gun problem, and that’s something the president would say, and there are communities where local violence and community violence is an issue, and that’s one of the reasons that we have proposed and now are implementing funding for community violence prevention programs across this country. I will say that we don’t often highlight — and you just gave me the opportunity to — the fact that between mass shootings, mass shootings that get a lot of attention … there are hundreds, thousands of people who lose their lives, and that’s one of the reasons the president will continue to advocate for the Senate passing [gun control measures] but also advocate for actions in states where we have seen the greatest level of activism over the past several years.” That was a convoluted way of insisting that the grossly disproportionate black-on-black murder and violence is a “gun problem” rather than what it actually is, a cultural problem created primarily by years of misguided leftist social policies. Despite her disjointed answer, Psaki managed to use Vega’s question as fodder for leftists’ relentless assault on the Second Amendment, which they know is the most formidable barrier to their relentless assault on other civil rights. Time for Psaki to circle back for a reality check. The Democrat Party is the author of cultural violence in America, and until the party addresses the real problem, the underlying policy issues that have resulted in the cultural devolution of its most loyal constituency, the violence will continue unabated. Finally, on this the anniversary of George Floyd’s death, we’re hard-pressed to find a single good outcome from all the riotous outrage. The agenda-driven Leftmedia and Leftist politicians insisted that the riots were “mostly peaceful protests,” ostensibly in the name of eradicating “systemic racism” – both assertions being demonstrable and despicable lies. Fittingly, at George Floyd square in Minneapolis, as reporters were gathering to do what they do best, they were forced to scatter like rats as gunfire erupted in the middle of the day. Floyd’s family and their lawyer were not present for the Minneapolis celebrations. Joe Biden flew them in for a White House photo op, presumably at taxpayer expense so they would not have to draw on their record $27 million civil settlement days before the Chauvin trial started. Finally, what Psaki did not mention: I would draw your attention to the law enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of duty since Floyd’s death.

In the wake of Floyd’s death, protesters across the U.S. showed displeasure about another Black man being killed by law enforcement. The Black Lives Matter organization, which started in 2013, grew more popular among Americans in the weeks after Floyd’s death. In May 2019, one calendar year before George Floyd’s murder,  support for the Black Lives Matter movement was 42%, according to Civiqs tracking data. Support then jumped to 53% in the weeks following Floyd’s death. In the survey, 244,378 registered voters answered the question: “Do you support or oppose the Black Lives Matter movement?” Support for BLM is up over the past two years, but the momentum has dipped since its peak in June 2020, a few weeks after Floyd’s death. Additionally, more people now say they “oppose” the movement. See also: The verdict and settlement in George Floyd’s death were rare — but these financial measures could boost police accountability It’s not uncommon for certain issues to get short-lived bumps after momentous events. For example, there is historical data to suggest that Americans’ demand for gun control legislation typically spikes after a mass shooting, before settling back to near pre-event levels. See also: Companies that declared solidarity after George Floyd killing may be ‘woke washing,’ shareholder advocates warn And other polls suggest that Americans do not believe race relations are improving. According to a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll, 46% of Americans say race relations have gotten worse over the past five years, and just 30% of respondents anticipate they will be better five years from now. President Joe Biden has invited George Floyd’s mother, siblings and other family members to a private ceremony at the White House on Tuesday — White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is “eager to listen” to the family’s thoughts on the issue of police reform.

You don’t have to stop for the police in Minneapolis anymore, thanks to Mayor Frey and the city council. Cops get frustrated,” said Steve Dykstra, who left the force last summer, adding that he refuses to be a “stand-down cop.” “What you see is chaos, violence, and reoccurring crime.” Will this be the price of living in an American city in the future? With so many policemen retiring and the radical city council still calling for more cuts in police funding, what’s happening in Minneapolis is likely to be duplicated in many cities. Fox News: Grappling with a shortage of officers and increased crime, Minneapolis is seeking federal and state resources after the latest bout of violence in the city included a mass shooting that left a college student dead hours before his graduation Saturday. Amid the increased violence in the city where George Floyd was killed nearly one year ago, officials also announced a $30,000 reward this weekend in the hunt for suspects responsible for the separate shootings of three children over the past several weeks, including one 9-year-old girl killed by stray gunfire while jumping on a backyard trampoline. Rewards won’t stop any violence or murders. Kids are going to continue to die bloody, meaningless deaths because adults live in a fantasy world where there are no bad people, only bad cops. During the early Saturday mass shooting, two people were killed and another eight wounded after gunshots rang out just before 2 a.m. outside in the 300 block of N 1st Ave. Investigators say two men got into an argument and began firing amid a crowd gathered on the sidewalk near Monarch nightclub. Nearly 200 Minneapolis police officers have left the force in the wake of the death of Floyd, with many filing post-traumatic stress claims due to the civil unrest that followed. Minneapolis has seen at least 31 homicides this year, not including this weekend’s violence. Would putting more cops on the street really make a difference? That’s a question many cities are asking. How many is enough? City-data shows that the number of working police officers has fallen from 817 to 638 in January. Some of those officers are on leave after the riots last summer. Many of them will not be returning. MPR News: Police Department Finance Director Robin McPherson said to her knowledge none of the officers who went on leave last year have returned to duty. The council created a public safety staffing reserve fund in this year’s budget. Funds in the reserve could be accessed by the chief after presenting a hiring plan to the council. That hiring plan calls for 674 officers on the streets by year’s end. Given the number of retirements and officers on permanent leave, the department shouldn’t have any problem meeting that number.

This past weekend was a grand slam! The weekend timeline is considered 12 noon Friday to 6:00 am Monday by the crime-tracking site heyjackass.com With 13 killed and 42 wounded by firearms, this was the worst lead-fest weekend of 2021 and the worst 4th weekend of May since 2015, when Chicago stacked 12 dead and 45 wounded. If this trend continues into the hot, humid summer, Chicago’s morgue will need to hire seasonal help. Good news! The weather forecast for Memorial Day weekend, the start of Chicago’s Annual Summer Festival of Lead, is calling for cooler weather and hopefully cooler gun barrels. The hot, humid months of July and August typically find the air thick with “love letters” and the hospitals packed with the punctured. So far this month thirteen people have died of their perforations and another 42 were wounded and taken out of battle.

As of May 25, a Chicagoan is shot and wounded every 2 hours, 32 minutes, and one is shot to death every 13 hours, 37 minutes. Thus far this year 81.6% of the shooting victims have been black, 14.1% were Hispanic, and 4.4% are listed as “white or other.” Most shootings won’t result in an arrest. Eleven of the shootings this month took place in western Chicago’s Garfield Park neighborhood, which now challenges southside Englewood as the section of Chi-town most likely to get you penetrated. Forty-four of the victims were men and 11, or 20%, of the people getting new piercings, were women, which is roughly twice as many lady-victims as we see in winter months. The yearly men-women shot ratio for 2021 is currently 6.07. There have been 10 mass shootings thus far in 2021. None of the shootings in May were self-inflicted. Five people this month have been shot in the keister and one was shot in the private parts, (OUCH). Chicago banned the sale and registration of handguns in 1982.

59,https://www.theroot.com/texas-lawmakers-approve-legislation-that-would-let-peop-1846966879,"You know, if I were a lawmaker in a state where multiple mass shootings have taken place this year alone, I probably wouldn’t be gung-ho about making it easier for the wrong people to get a gun. Texas Republicans will never miss an opportunity to have the wrong priorities, though, and are set to approve legislation that would let people carry a handgun without a license. So yeah, don’t ask me to do anything in Texas. Ever. Sorry, it’s just that self-preservation is kind of a big thing for me. According to the Texas Tribune, the bill is set to go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s desk after receiving approval in the state House on Sunday, and the state Senate on Monday. Abbott has previously said he would sign the bill that would allow anyone 21 and over to carry a handgun without a license. Under current state law, people have to submit fingerprints, complete four to six hours of training, take a written test and a shooting proficiency test. Sounds reasonable, right? Well, not if you’re a Republican lawmaker in Texas. “This is a simple restoration of Texans’ constitutional right under the Second Amendment, a right of the people to keep and bear arms,” state Sen. Charles Schwertner (R-Georgetown), said on the floor Monday. “I think it is a bill that is the strongest bill I’ve seen in my legislative career regarding the rights of our Second Amendment.” What’s even weirder about this move is that there wasn’t widespread public support for it. In fact, it was quite the opposite, as the Texas Tribune notes that a recent poll revealed a solid majority of Texas voters don’t want this. It only goes to show that Republicans are really just doing things based on ideology, and not on what the public actually wants. Even the blue they love to talk about backing has been like “What the fuck are you guys doing?” “The right to bear arms is not unfettered,” Kevin Lawrence, president of the Texas Municipal Police Association, said at the state Capitol last month, according to NBC News. “We disagree with the folks that push this issue. They take one half of one amendment and ignore the rest of the Constitution.” Some lawmakers from El Paso were particularly disheartened by the bill, which is understandable given that this was the first legislative session since the 2019 mass shooting in an El Paso Walmart where 23 people were killed. “All [El Paso community members] wanted was something better. All they wanted was some accountability. Yet here we are,” state Rep. Joe Moody (D-El Paso) said Sunday on the House floor. “When the doors were closed, I heard lots of promises. I haven’t heard them since.” I can’t decide if of this legislative shit is overconfidence on the Qpublicans part because they think they’ve stacked the courts sufficiently so shit like this will stand. Or if they can see the writing on the wall about how increasingly unpopular they are becoming and want to fuck everything up on their way out. Probably in the hopes the voters will get fed up with the inability of their replacements to fix the mess and re-elect them. That last bit might sound silly but its how the Conservative and Liberal parties operate on the provincial level in Canada.

62,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/active-shooter-response-underway-near-san-jose-vta-light-rail-yard/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — In what is now the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting, a Valley Transportation Authority employee known for nursing grievances and a hot temper opened fire early Wednesday morning at a VTA light rail yard building, fatally wounding nine people before taking his own life, authorities said. Rochelle Hawkins, a VTA mechanic, said when she heard shots she dropped her phone. “I was running so fast, I just ran for my life,” she said. “I would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.”  On Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the nine victims as 42-year-old Paul Delacruz Megia, 36-year-old Taptejdeep Singh, 29-year-old Adrian Balleza, 35-year-old Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 49-year-old Timothy Michael Romo, 40-year-old Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 63-year-old Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63-year-old Lars Kepler Lane and 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. Fritch was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. The gunman was identified by multiple sources as Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA maintenance worker. Authorities would not say what might have led to the rampage, what type of weapon was used or whether he obtained it legally. Samuel James Cassidy   (Santa Clara County) Sheriff Laurie Smith, whose office headquarters are near the rail yard, said deputies entered the building as shots were still being fired, but did not exchange gunfire with the gunman. “We have some very brave officers and deputies,” Smith said. In a news release Wednesday evening, the sheriff’s office said deputies found the suspect dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There was a heavy police presence at Cassidy’s house in San Jose, where a fire erupted before the shooting and was reported shortly after. Bomb squad technicians were at the scene throughout the day. Authorities would not say how the fire might have started. Explosive devices also were reported in the VTA building, and bomb dogs alerted to the devices, Smith said. Bomb squads were there as well. About 100 VTA workers, most of them men, and some family members were escorted from the sheriff’s office to a larger auditorium across the street in the county administration. Inside the auditorium, screams and wailing broke out. Workers said they were told not to talk to news reporters, but one worker said he was shaken to the core. “The whole crew is gone, the whole shift is gone,” the worker, who didn’t want to be identified, said. “It’s horrible.” Another VTA worker who didn’t want to be identified said that a woman had just learned her son was one of the fatalities. “I just witnessed someone’s mom who just found out her son died,” the VTA worker said. “It was ugly.” President Biden also was briefed, and later called on Congress “to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Governor Gavin Newsom visited San Jose in the afternoon and had similar remarks. “There’s a sameness to this, and a numbness I think is something we’re all feeling,” Newsom said in San Jose. “It begs the damn question, ‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?'” What the Associated Press counted as the 15th U.S. mass shooting this year renewed cries for more laws to reduce gun violence. Among others were eight people fatally shot April 15 by a former employee at an Indianapolis FedEx facility; six people shot by a former NFL player April 7 in Rock Hill, South Carolina; 10 killed by a gunman on March 22 in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado; and eight killed by a shooter on March 16 at three Atlanta-area massage businesses. The massacre ranks as the region’s worst mass shooting, eclipsing one at a San Francisco law firm in July 1993 that left nine dead, including the shooter, a disgruntled client who also died by suicide. That shooting inspired a since-expired federal ban on military-style weapons. California has a “red flag” law that lets family members and law enforcement ask a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a threatening person. Legislation by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, expanded the “gun violence restraining order” law in September to allow employers and coworkers also to make such requests. But there were no immediate indications of home or workplace strife that might have triggered the deadly rampage. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday he does not believe the law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. “It only takes one incident,” Rosen said. “We have to be perfect to stop all of these killings and we try our very best.” One worker who sat sobbing on the phone with his wife afterward said he knew of no bad feelings among coworkers. “I come to work and have a good time and enjoy my job,” he said. Even so, Cassidy’s dark side unnerved those around him. Cassidy’s former wife, Cecilia Nelms of Santa Cruz, who was married to him for 10 years but hasn’t seen him in 13, said he had a mercurial temper. She said he complained some coworkers got easier assignments than he did and resented that his father paid for his sister’s education while he worked to become a mechanic on his own. But she never knew Cassidy to have guns, and struggled to connect the man she knew with a mass shooting. In 2009, Cassidy filed for a domestic violence restraining order against an ex-girlfriend, alleging harassment, and she in turn filed a response accusing him of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol abuse. Doug Suh, who lives across the street from Cassidy, described him as “lonely” and “strange” and said he never saw friends or family visit. “I’d say hello and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. “One day I was backing out of his driveway and he yelled at me, ‘Don’t even go on my driveway!’ After that, I never talked to him again.” The shooting was reported at 6:34 a.m. at the rail yard at 101 West Younger Ave., near San Pedro Street, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies currently on scene for an active shooter investigation in the area of 100 W. Younger Ave. SJ. Please stay away from the area. More info to follow. — SantaClaraCoSheriff (@SCCoSheriff) May 26, 2021  A neighbor’s security video shows Cassidy leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. with a large black duffel bag that he put in the passenger seat of his white Ford F-150 pickup truck. According to sheriff’s office spokesman Russell Davis, some of the shooting victims are VTA employees. KTVU reported that it spoke to the mother of an employee who reported that the shooting happened at a union meeting. It was not known immediately if the shooting happened inside or outside, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The mass shooting occurred in the VTA maintenance yard, where vehicles are dispatched — not in the organization’s operations center, according to the board chair. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said the city is in a “very dark moment,” but that he is “heartened by the response of the VTA family to come together and help their coworkers.” A vigil for the victims is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday at City Hall Plaza. “This is a moment for us to come together and grieve after today’s horrific tragedy.” A shooting at the VTA facility on Younger St has left several people being treated, but the situation is still being assessed.  The shooter is no longer a threat, and the facility has been evacuated.  I will update as more information becomes available. — Sam Liccardo (@sliccardo) May 26, 2021  People Acting in Community Together, or PACT, and Human Empowerment (through) Radical Optimism, or HERO Tent, held vigils for the victims Wednesday evening at St. James Park and City Hall, respectively. “My heart mourns for those who were lost today — innocent men and women — and the families now without mothers and fathers who have to make sense of this mess, to make sense of insanity, to make sense of senseless violence,” said the Rev. Ray Montgomery, executive director of PACT. One VTA employee who did not want to be identified said workers were told, “Run outside the building now! There’s an active shooter!” Another said he saw people scattering around the yard as shots rang out. Two male shooting victims were transferred to Valley Medical Center in San Jose. One person was dead on arrival and another was in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. The coroner’s office said the second victim later died of his injuries. “We’d be the closest to get the most seriously injured patients,” Alexiou said. “People with lesser injuries can be transferred to other hospitals.” The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. Singh said the shooting had not happened at an official ATU union meeting, as those meetings are held at the union hall in Campbell. He said he’s received calls from members expressing shock and from family members unable to get in touch with their loved ones. “This is unspeakable,” he said. “You hear about it happening somewhere else and you think never here.” Light rail service initially continued but VTA later announce the trains would stop running at noon. We will be shutting down light rail service starting at noon today until further notice. We will have bus bridges in place to provide limited service while we work through this. The light rail yard remains an active investigation scene, limiting our ability to provide service. — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Confirming that:– Active Shooter at VTA Light Rail Yard around 6:45a– Multiple casualties, extent of injuries being determined– Suspect deceased– Employees evacuated– VTA service not impacted (trains were in service before incident) — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Check back for updates.

Reporter National Reporter SAN JOSE—Over a decade before Samuel Cassidy opened fire at the Bay Area light rail yard where he worked, killing at least nine people, he was accused of raping and abusing his ex-girlfriend during violent “mood swings.” “Several times during the relationship, he became intoxicated, enraged, and forced himself on me sexually,” the ex-girlfriend, who was 45 years old at the time of their volatile relationship, said in 2009 court documents first obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. “He also played several mind games, which he seems to enjoy.” According to the filings and the ex-girlfriend’s lawyer, Robert Gary Cummings, the couple met on Match.com. While their relationship lasted about a year, it was doomed just two months in, when Cassidy proposed to her, Cummings said. “She said, ‘No, this is all too soon.’ And that then became a big issue for him in their relationship. And he started to gaslight her, if you will, and so he filed some nasty things about her in court,” Cummings told The Daily Beast. The relationship got so toxic that the pair filed domestic violence restraining orders against each other, he added. In the ex’s motion, she claimed that Cassidy had major “mood swings” from what she believed to be bipolar disorder. She added that Cassidy forced himself on her repeatedly and that she also had to fight him off when he attempted to force her into anal sex. Cassidy’s ex initially agreed to an interview, but after Cummings arranged a Zoom conference with The Daily Beast and six other news outlets, the woman—who does not want to be named—decided not to participate after speaking to a friend. Cummings confirmed everything that has been reported so far and said he believes the woman’s story is credible. “There were definitely issues of forced sexual contact and other things to that effect, she felt that he was bipolar, that his moods ran hot and cold,” he said, adding that Cassidy and his former girlfriend agreed not to contact each other ever again as a condition of the court settlement. When she heard about the shooting Wednesday, “she was shocked. Even with the allegations that she put in [the court filings]... she was shocked by it,” Cummings said. In response to The Daily Beast’s question about any beefs at work Cassidy may have ever talked about, Cummings responded: “There was a female at work that he had issues with and would rant about. She doesn’t remember who that person was, she couldn’t recall at this point in time. It sounded like a kind of office politics type of upset-ness.” On Wednesday, Cassidy reportedly set his own home ablaze, then drove to the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) rail yard and began shooting during a union meeting around 6:30 a.m. PT, just as the overnight team was handing off to the morning crew. When police showed up, Cassidy turned the gun on himself. The suspect’s father, 88-year-old James Edward Cassidy, told The Daily Beast that he was shocked by the news, as his son “seemed completely himself” in the days before the incident. “He didn’t talk about his job or politics. I just found out he was dead and his house on fire and all that a minute ago,” he said in an interview. Cummings said Cassidy’s ex-girlfriend never said anything about him showing signs of a fixation with firearms or anger about his job. Doug Suh, one of Cassidy’s neighbors, told The Daily Beast that he and his wife could not recall a single positive interaction with the loner in the five years they’ve lived across the street from him. Once, when backing out of his driveway, Cassidy yelled, “Don’t even come to my driveway!” Suh said. Another time, when Suh’s wife tried to say hello, Cassidy stared her down, he recalled. Suh said he and his wife both felt “scared” of Cassidy and tried to avoid him. Suh’s security camera captured firefighters responding to Cassidy’s burning home at around 6:44 a.m. Wednesday, a recording he shared with The Daily Beast. Another video he shared from 5:40 a.m. showed Cassidy opening the driver’s side door of a white truck before driving away. He was wearing what appeared to be a VTA work uniform. “He had two sides,” Cassidy’s ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told The Mercury-News on Wednesday. “When he was in a good mood, he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad.” Late Wednesday morning, authorities were still investigating multiple scenes and clearing the rail yard after receiving “information” there were still explosive devices in the building, Santa Clara County sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Russell Davis told reporters. “We activated our bomb squad, which is currently out on scene,” he added. On Wednesday afternoon, Davis added that trained dogs “detected... some kind of explosives material at the crime scene itself.” A spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Valley Health System told The Daily Beast that at least two of the shooting victims were taken to the local hospital. One male victim was pronounced dead on arrival and another was listed in critical condition. “This is just a horrible tragedy that has occurred,” VTA Chairman Glenn Hendricks said during a Wednesday press conference. “We’re so sorry this event happened... VTA is a family.” VTA spokeswoman Brandi Childress told The Daily Beast that the shooting occurred at the Guadalupe light rail maintenance yard and resulted in “multiple casualties” but that “the extent of the injuries is still being determined.” “All employees were evacuated. The sheriff’s office, which is just down the street from the location, is the reunification center for employees and family members who may be looking for them,” Childress added. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told The New York Times that it appeared the suspect’s house was on fire Wednesday morning, “but that there was nobody inside.” Law enforcement officials confirmed to The Daily Beast that gasoline and ammunition were found throughout the house. “There’s a strange connection here between arson and the shooting,” the mayor added. Aerial footage of the shooting scene obtained by KGO showed a massive law enforcement presence and several ambulances near the rail yard. California Gov. Gavin Newsom tweeted Wednesday that his office was in “contact with local law enforcement and monitoring this situation closely.” President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, and the “White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed,” the administration said in a statement. The circumstances of the shooting remain unclear, but the mother of a VTA employee reportedly contacted KTVU to say her son called to say he was sheltering in the auditorium of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and that the shooting occurred during a union meeting. In the hours after the attack, at least 100 VTA workers and friends and family were seen walking through a concrete plaza into a low-slung Santa Clara County building in San Jose to a reunification center for victims. One uniformed worker told The Mercury News, “The whole crew is gone, the whole shift is gone. It’s horrible.” Also among the group was Keith Baldwin, a 58-year-old from Tracy, who was looking for his neighbor, Tim Romo. Baldwin told The Daily Beast that Romo was still unaccounted for, so he went to the center to wait as his neighbor’s wife was still more than an hour’s drive away. “I was just with him last night,” Baldwin told The Daily Beast. “He was going to go on vacation—just him and his wife were going to see his son on Sunday, and he was looking forward to doing that.” Michael Hawkins, a San Jose resident, was also anxiously waiting at the reunification center. He told a group of reporters he arrived a few minutes after 10 a.m. to look for his wife, Rochelle, after he got a message from her that she was alive. “I’m just here for my wife and hoping she’s OK and whoever else in there is OK,” he told reporters. “The message [she sent] said that she dropped her phone and she’s all right. She said she dropped her phone from running and she’s using a co-worker’s phone.” The Bay Area mass shooting comes amid a spate of gun violence across the nation, including a “targeted attack” at a New Jersey birthday party last weekend that killed three people. “There’s a sameness to this, and a numbness I think is something we’re all feeling,” Newsom said during a Wednesday news briefing. “It begs the damn question, ‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?’” By late morning local time on Wednesday, police, firefighters, and paramedics were blockading the environs of the suspect’s San Jose home. The neighborhood was mostly single-family homes in light shades of tan, off-white, and pink, surrounded by fences and trees, including the occasional palm reaching high into the sky. Even with the fire crews and police, children rode their bicycles and scooters on adjacent streets. Joy Lovett, 61, a former neighbor, was in shock upon hearing the news, describing Cassidy in an interview as “normal” and recalling that he seemed to have a typical social life and frequently had friends around. There was “nothing bizarre” about him, she told The Daily Beast. “He didn’t seem isolated... He was a happy-go-lucky guy.” But Suh, the more recent neighbor, painted a darker picture of an isolated man, one more consistent with the account offered by Cassidy’s ex in court records, noting that he never saw him have visitors. And other neighbors seemed to be virtually unaware of him. “They don’t even talk to him,” Suh said. —with reporting by McCaffrey Blauner  Reporter National Reporter Got a tip?

64,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/26/active-shooter-response-underway-near-san-jose-vta-light-rail-yard/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — In what is now the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting, a Valley Transportation Authority employee known for nursing grievances and a hot temper opened fire early Wednesday morning at a VTA light rail yard building, fatally wounding nine people before taking his own life, authorities said. Rochelle Hawkins, a VTA mechanic, said when she heard shots she dropped her phone. “I was running so fast, I just ran for my life,” she said. “I would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.”  On Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the nine victims as 42-year-old Paul Delacruz Megia, 36-year-old Taptejdeep Singh, 29-year-old Adrian Balleza, 35-year-old Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 49-year-old Timothy Michael Romo, 40-year-old Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 63-year-old Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63-year-old Lars Kepler Lane and 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. Fritch was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. The gunman was identified by multiple sources as Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA maintenance worker. Authorities would not say what might have led to the rampage, what type of weapon was used or whether he obtained it legally. Samuel James Cassidy   (Santa Clara County) Sheriff Laurie Smith, whose office headquarters are near the rail yard, said deputies entered the building as shots were still being fired, but did not exchange gunfire with the gunman. “We have some very brave officers and deputies,” Smith said. In a news release Wednesday evening, the sheriff’s office said deputies found the suspect dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There was a heavy police presence at Cassidy’s house in San Jose, where a fire erupted before the shooting and was reported shortly after. Bomb squad technicians were at the scene throughout the day. Authorities would not say how the fire might have started. Explosive devices also were reported in the VTA building, and bomb dogs alerted to the devices, Smith said. Bomb squads were there as well. About 100 VTA workers, most of them men, and some family members were escorted from the sheriff’s office to a larger auditorium across the street in the county administration. Inside the auditorium, screams and wailing broke out. Workers said they were told not to talk to news reporters, but one worker said he was shaken to the core. “The whole crew is gone, the whole shift is gone,” the worker, who didn’t want to be identified, said. “It’s horrible.” Another VTA worker who didn’t want to be identified said that a woman had just learned her son was one of the fatalities. “I just witnessed someone’s mom who just found out her son died,” the VTA worker said. “It was ugly.” President Biden also was briefed, and later called on Congress “to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Governor Gavin Newsom visited San Jose in the afternoon and had similar remarks. “There’s a sameness to this, and a numbness I think is something we’re all feeling,” Newsom said in San Jose. “It begs the damn question, ‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?’” What the Associated Press counted as the 15th U.S. mass shooting this year renewed cries for more laws to reduce gun violence. Among others were eight people fatally shot April 15 by a former employee at an Indianapolis FedEx facility; six people shot by a former NFL player April 7 in Rock Hill, South Carolina; 10 killed by a gunman on March 22 in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado; and eight killed by a shooter on March 16 at three Atlanta-area massage businesses. The massacre ranks as the region’s worst mass shooting, eclipsing one at a San Francisco law firm in July 1993 that left nine dead, including the shooter, a disgruntled client who also died by suicide. That shooting inspired a since-expired federal ban on military-style weapons. California has a “red flag” law that lets family members and law enforcement ask a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a threatening person. Legislation by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, expanded the “gun violence restraining order” law in September to allow employers and coworkers also to make such requests. But there were no immediate indications of home or workplace strife that might have triggered the deadly rampage. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday he does not believe the law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. “It only takes one incident,” Rosen said. “We have to be perfect to stop all of these killings and we try our very best.” One worker who sat sobbing on the phone with his wife afterward said he knew of no bad feelings among coworkers. “I come to work and have a good time and enjoy my job,” he said. Even so, Cassidy’s dark side unnerved those around him. Cassidy’s former wife, Cecilia Nelms of Santa Cruz, who was married to him for 10 years but hasn’t seen him in 13, said he had a mercurial temper. She said he complained some coworkers got easier assignments than he did and resented that his father paid for his sister’s education while he worked to become a mechanic on his own. But she never knew Cassidy to have guns, and struggled to connect the man she knew with a mass shooting. In 2009, Cassidy filed for a domestic violence restraining order against an ex-girlfriend, alleging harassment, and she in turn filed a response accusing him of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol abuse. Doug Suh, who lives across the street from Cassidy, described him as “lonely” and “strange” and said he never saw friends or family visit. “I’d say hello and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. “One day I was backing out of his driveway and he yelled at me, ‘Don’t even go on my driveway!’ After that, I never talked to him again.” The shooting was reported at 6:34 a.m. at the rail yard at 101 West Younger Ave., near San Pedro Street, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies currently on scene for an active shooter investigation in the area of 100 W. Younger Ave. SJ. Please stay away from the area. More info to follow. — SantaClaraCoSheriff (@SCCoSheriff) May 26, 2021  A neighbor’s security video shows Cassidy leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. with a large black duffel bag that he put in the passenger seat of his white Ford F-150 pickup truck. According to sheriff’s office spokesman Russell Davis, some of the shooting victims are VTA employees. KTVU reported that it spoke to the mother of an employee who reported that the shooting happened at a union meeting. It was not known immediately if the shooting happened inside or outside, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The mass shooting occurred in the VTA maintenance yard, where vehicles are dispatched — not in the organization’s operations center, according to the board chair. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said the city is in a “very dark moment,” but that he is “heartened by the response of the VTA family to come together and help their coworkers.” A vigil for the victims is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday at City Hall Plaza. “This is a moment for us to come together and grieve after today’s horrific tragedy.” A shooting at the VTA facility on Younger St has left several people being treated, but the situation is still being assessed.  The shooter is no longer a threat, and the facility has been evacuated.  I will update as more information becomes available. — Sam Liccardo (@sliccardo) May 26, 2021  People Acting in Community Together, or PACT, and Human Empowerment (through) Radical Optimism, or HERO Tent, held vigils for the victims Wednesday evening at St. James Park and City Hall, respectively. “My heart mourns for those who were lost today — innocent men and women — and the families now without mothers and fathers who have to make sense of this mess, to make sense of insanity, to make sense of senseless violence,” said the Rev. Ray Montgomery, executive director of PACT. One VTA employee who did not want to be identified said workers were told, “Run outside the building now! There’s an active shooter!” Another said he saw people scattering around the yard as shots rang out. Two male shooting victims were transferred to Valley Medical Center in San Jose. One person was dead on arrival and another was in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. The coroner’s office said the second victim later died of his injuries. “We’d be the closest to get the most seriously injured patients,” Alexiou said. “People with lesser injuries can be transferred to other hospitals.” The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. Singh said the shooting had not happened at an official ATU union meeting, as those meetings are held at the union hall in Campbell. He said he’s received calls from members expressing shock and from family members unable to get in touch with their loved ones. “This is unspeakable,” he said. “You hear about it happening somewhere else and you think never here.” Light rail service initially continued but VTA later announce the trains would stop running at noon. We will be shutting down light rail service starting at noon today until further notice. We will have bus bridges in place to provide limited service while we work through this. The light rail yard remains an active investigation scene, limiting our ability to provide service. — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Confirming that:– Active Shooter at VTA Light Rail Yard around 6:45a– Multiple casualties, extent of injuries being determined– Suspect deceased– Employees evacuated– VTA service not impacted (trains were in service before incident) — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Check back for updates.

X OUR PICKS: SAN JOSE — In what is now the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting, a Valley Transportation Authority employee known for nursing grievances and a hot temper opened fire early Wednesday morning at a VTA light rail yard building, fatally wounding nine people before taking his own life, authorities said. Rochelle Hawkins, a VTA mechanic, said when she heard shots she dropped her phone. “I was running so fast, I just ran for my life,” she said. “I would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.”  On Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the nine victims as 42-year-old Paul Delacruz Megia, 36-year-old Taptejdeep Singh, 29-year-old Adrian Balleza, 35-year-old Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 49-year-old Timothy Michael Romo, 40-year-old Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 63-year-old Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63-year-old Lars Kepler Lane and 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. Fritch was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. The gunman was identified by multiple sources as Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA maintenance worker. Authorities would not say what might have led to the rampage, what type of weapon was used or whether he obtained it legally. Samuel James Cassidy   (Santa Clara County) Sheriff Laurie Smith, whose office headquarters are near the rail yard, said deputies entered the building as shots were still being fired, but did not exchange gunfire with the gunman. “We have some very brave officers and deputies,” Smith said. In a news release Wednesday evening, the sheriff’s office said deputies found the suspect dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. There was a heavy police presence at Cassidy’s house in San Jose, where a fire erupted before the shooting and was reported shortly after. Bomb squad technicians were at the scene throughout the day. Authorities would not say how the fire might have started. Explosive devices also were reported in the VTA building, and bomb dogs alerted to the devices, Smith said. Bomb squads were there as well. About 100 VTA workers, most of them men, and some family members were escorted from the sheriff’s office to a larger auditorium across the street in the county administration. Inside the auditorium, screams and wailing broke out. Workers said they were told not to talk to news reporters, but one worker said he was shaken to the core. “The whole crew is gone, the whole shift is gone,” the worker, who didn’t want to be identified, said. “It’s horrible.” Another VTA worker who didn’t want to be identified said that a woman had just learned her son was one of the fatalities. “I just witnessed someone’s mom who just found out her son died,” the VTA worker said. “It was ugly.” President Biden also was briefed, and later called on Congress “to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Governor Gavin Newsom visited San Jose in the afternoon and had similar remarks. “There’s a sameness to this, and a numbness I think is something we’re all feeling,” Newsom said in San Jose. “It begs the damn question, ‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?’” What the Associated Press counted as the 15th U.S. mass shooting this year renewed cries for more laws to reduce gun violence. Among others were eight people fatally shot April 15 by a former employee at an Indianapolis FedEx facility; six people shot by a former NFL player April 7 in Rock Hill, South Carolina; 10 killed by a gunman on March 22 in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado; and eight killed by a shooter on March 16 at three Atlanta-area massage businesses. The massacre ranks as the region’s worst mass shooting, eclipsing one at a San Francisco law firm in July 1993 that left nine dead, including the shooter, a disgruntled client who also died by suicide. That shooting inspired a since-expired federal ban on military-style weapons. California has a “red flag” law that lets family members and law enforcement ask a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a threatening person. Legislation by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, expanded the “gun violence restraining order” law in September to allow employers and coworkers also to make such requests. But there were no immediate indications of home or workplace strife that might have triggered the deadly rampage. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday he does not believe the law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. “It only takes one incident,” Rosen said. “We have to be perfect to stop all of these killings and we try our very best.” One worker who sat sobbing on the phone with his wife afterward said he knew of no bad feelings among coworkers. “I come to work and have a good time and enjoy my job,” he said. Even so, Cassidy’s dark side unnerved those around him. Cassidy’s former wife, Cecilia Nelms of Santa Cruz, who was married to him for 10 years but hasn’t seen him in 13, said he had a mercurial temper. She said he complained some coworkers got easier assignments than he did and resented that his father paid for his sister’s education while he worked to become a mechanic on his own. But she never knew Cassidy to have guns, and struggled to connect the man she knew with a mass shooting. In 2009, Cassidy filed for a domestic violence restraining order against an ex-girlfriend, alleging harassment, and she in turn filed a response accusing him of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol abuse. Doug Suh, who lives across the street from Cassidy, described him as “lonely” and “strange” and said he never saw friends or family visit. “I’d say hello and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. “One day I was backing out of his driveway and he yelled at me, ‘Don’t even go on my driveway!’ After that, I never talked to him again.” The shooting was reported at 6:34 a.m. at the rail yard at 101 West Younger Ave., near San Pedro Street, the sheriff’s office said. Deputies currently on scene for an active shooter investigation in the area of 100 W. Younger Ave. SJ. Please stay away from the area. More info to follow. — SantaClaraCoSheriff (@SCCoSheriff) May 26, 2021  A neighbor’s security video shows Cassidy leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. with a large black duffel bag that he put in the passenger seat of his white Ford F-150 pickup truck. According to sheriff’s office spokesman Russell Davis, some of the shooting victims are VTA employees. KTVU reported that it spoke to the mother of an employee who reported that the shooting happened at a union meeting. It was not known immediately if the shooting happened inside or outside, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The mass shooting occurred in the VTA maintenance yard, where vehicles are dispatched — not in the organization’s operations center, according to the board chair. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said the city is in a “very dark moment,” but that he is “heartened by the response of the VTA family to come together and help their coworkers.” A vigil for the victims is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday at City Hall Plaza. “This is a moment for us to come together and grieve after today’s horrific tragedy.” A shooting at the VTA facility on Younger St has left several people being treated, but the situation is still being assessed.  The shooter is no longer a threat, and the facility has been evacuated.  I will update as more information becomes available. — Sam Liccardo (@sliccardo) May 26, 2021  People Acting in Community Together, or PACT, and Human Empowerment (through) Radical Optimism, or HERO Tent, held vigils for the victims Wednesday evening at St. James Park and City Hall, respectively. “My heart mourns for those who were lost today — innocent men and women — and the families now without mothers and fathers who have to make sense of this mess, to make sense of insanity, to make sense of senseless violence,” said the Rev. Ray Montgomery, executive director of PACT. One VTA employee who did not want to be identified said workers were told, “Run outside the building now! There’s an active shooter!” Another said he saw people scattering around the yard as shots rang out. Two male shooting victims were transferred to Valley Medical Center in San Jose. One person was dead on arrival and another was in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. The coroner’s office said the second victim later died of his injuries. “We’d be the closest to get the most seriously injured patients,” Alexiou said. “People with lesser injuries can be transferred to other hospitals.” The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. Singh said the shooting had not happened at an official ATU union meeting, as those meetings are held at the union hall in Campbell. He said he’s received calls from members expressing shock and from family members unable to get in touch with their loved ones. “This is unspeakable,” he said. “You hear about it happening somewhere else and you think never here.” Light rail service initially continued but VTA later announce the trains would stop running at noon. We will be shutting down light rail service starting at noon today until further notice. We will have bus bridges in place to provide limited service while we work through this. The light rail yard remains an active investigation scene, limiting our ability to provide service. — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Confirming that:– Active Shooter at VTA Light Rail Yard around 6:45a– Multiple casualties, extent of injuries being determined– Suspect deceased– Employees evacuated– VTA service not impacted (trains were in service before incident) — VTA (@VTA) May 26, 2021  Check back for updates.

73,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/us/politics/david-chipman-atf-senate.html,"David Chipman, a two-decade veteran of the A.T.F. who serves as an adviser to a major gun control group, faced fierce criticism from Republicans during his confirmation hearing.  Biden’s pick to lead A.T.F. faces fierce opposition at his confirmation hearing. President Biden calls for U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the virus. Biden is said to be planning to nominate Burns and Garcetti for ambassadorships. A filibuster fight is looming in the Senate. The mother of a Capitol Police officer who died lobbies G.O.P. to drop their opposition to an inquiry. Karine Jean-Pierre takes her turn at the White House podium. Biden’s ties to Israel face a stiff test as Iran talks loom. transcript “The leadership positions I held at A.T.F. grounded me in what it will take to improve bureau operations and morale. I’ve supervised agents in the field multiple times. I use that experience to develop new approaches to combat homicides committed with firearms impacting communities across the United States. While at A.T.F. headquarters during the Bush administration, I was responsible for all A.T.F. field policies and procedures. I later oversaw all firearms programs and foreign offices for the entire bureau. These experiences, hard won over the course of decades, will serve as my guide if I’m confirmed to lead the A.T.F. The bureau has excelled at investigating crimes since the days of Eliot Ness. My leadership mission will be to sharpen A.T.F.’s focus while striving to prevent more violent crimes from occurring in the first place.” “The AR-15 is one of, if not the most popular rifle in America. It’s not a machine gun, it’s a rifle. Your public position is that you want to ban AR-15s, is that correct?” “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president. The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on A.T.F. SWAT team. And it’s a particularly lethal weapon, and regulating it as other particularly lethal weapons, I have advocated for. As A.T.F. director, if I’m confirmed, I would simply enforce the laws on the books. And right now, there is no such ban on those guns.” David Chipman, President Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, faced withering Republican criticism during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday over his history of scathing comments about gun ownership. Mr. Chipman, a two-decade veteran of the A.T.F. who has advised gun control groups, was chosen in part because of his willingness to bluntly confront an industry that has handcuffed the agency, which enforces gun laws. But his comments — including an interview last year in which he jokingly likened the frenzied buying of guns during the coronavirus pandemic to a zombie apocalypse — were the subject of repeated questions by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Many see putting a committed gun control proponent like David Chipman in charge of A.T.F. is like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, or antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the ranking member of the committee. As the hearing got underway, news alerts of a fatal shooting in San Jose, Calif., began pinging on lawmakers’ phones. “It is not lost on me that there is another mass shooting,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. The National Rifle Association has mounted a coordinated campaign against Mr. Chipman’s nomination, citing his promises to regulate semiautomatic weapons and his support of universal background checks. The organization has effectively exercised veto power over the appointment of stable leadership at the A.T.F., blocking several potential directors, including a conservative police union official tapped by President Donald J. Trump. The gun lobby has also led a decades-long campaign to hobble the A.T.F. by fighting funding increases and efforts to modernize its paper-based system of tracking firearms. Republicans said Mr. Chipman’s penchant for provocation made him an unacceptable choice, hoping to scuttle his nomination just as a history of inflammatory Twitter posts doomed the nomination of Neera Tanden, Mr. Biden’s first choice to run his budget office. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, grilled Mr. Chipman for saying in jest in an interview last year that some first-time gun buyers were preparing “for end times scenarios and zombie apocalypses.” Mr. Chipman, who appeared to try to avoid a back-and-forth with Republicans, said those remarks had been “self-deprecating.” He also deflected questions about his advocacy of progressive policy by saying that he viewed himself as “a cop.” A few minutes later, after Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, criticized him for calling for restrictions on AR-15-style rifles, Mr. Chipman thanked the senator for “offering me a Dr Pepper” during a private meeting the day before. Mr. Biden chose Mr. Chipman after a lobbying campaign by gun safety organizations, led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In recent years, Mr. Chipman has worked with groups run by Ms. Giffords and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, who also pressed for his selection. The White House was initially reluctant to nominate someone who would provoke such intense opposition, but Mr. Biden decided that he needed to take a chance after the mass killings in Atlanta and Boulder, White House officials said. White House officials believe that Mr. Chipman has just enough votes — 50 to 52, by their estimate — to overcome near-unanimous opposition by Republicans. Two critical Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have told Democratic leaders that they are likely to vote for him, provided the hearings go well. Two Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, have not ruled out supporting him. — Glenn Thrush transcript Today, the president asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to him in 90 days. Back in early 2020, the president called for the C.D.C. to get access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more effectively. Getting to the bottom of the origin of this pandemic will help us understand how to prepare for the next pandemic, and the next one. As we have done throughout our Covid response, we have been committed to a whole of government effort to ensure we’re doing everything to both understand and end this pandemic, and to prevent future pandemics. This is why the president is asking the U.S. intelligence community, in cooperation with other elements of our government, to redouble efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring the world closer to a definitive conclusion on the origin of the virus and deliver a report to him again in 90 days. And we will continue to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation with the needed access to get to the bottom of a virus that’s taken more than three million lives across the globe. President Biden ordered U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, indicating that his administration takes seriously the possibility that the deadly virus was accidentally leaked from a lab, in addition to the prevailing theory that it was transmitted by an animal to humans outside a lab. In a statement, Mr. Biden made it clear that the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies had not yet reached a consensus on how the virus, which prompted a pandemic and has killed almost 600,000 Americans, originated in China. He directed them to report back to him in 90 days. “I have now asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion,” the president said. Mr. Biden’s statement, his most public and expansive yet on the question of how the virus spread to humans, came as top health officials renewed their appeals this week for a more rigorous inquiry. And it followed mounting criticism of a report from an international team of experts convened by the World Health Organization that largely dismissed the possibility that the virus had accidentally escaped from a Chinese laboratory called the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Deep uncertainty remains about the origins of a virus that spread to every part of the globe over 17 months. The assessments of scientists are largely unchanged: Many believe that a so-called natural spillover from animal to human remains the most plausible explanation. While U.S. intelligence agencies have collected some new evidence, the additional information is not enough to allow them to draw definitive conclusions about long-simmering theories regarding the lab in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak. But the president’s carefully worded directive underscored a new surge in interest about the lab, which President Donald J. Trump and some of his top aides repeatedly blamed for the pandemic. Some scientists attributed the renewed focus on the lab to Mr. Trump’s departure from the White House — and being less identified with the theory — while others said it reflected the deep frustrations with the recent W.H.O. report that was co-written by Chinese scientists. — Michael D. Shear, Julian E. Barnes, Carl Zimmer and Benjamin Mueller President Biden plans to announce that he has selected R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran Foreign Service officer and a former ambassador to NATO, as his ambassador to China, and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles as his ambassador to India, according to two people familiar with the process. Mr. Biden has also selected Thomas R. Nides, a vice chairman at Morgan Stanley who served as a deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama, to serve as the ambassador to Israel, those people said. Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, who developed a close relationship with Mr. Biden when he was vice president, has been selected to serve as ambassador to Japan, the people said. And Ken Salazar, a former senator from Colorado and the interior secretary in the Obama administration, is said to have been chosen as the ambassador to Mexico. Mr. Biden has been reviewing lists of names for some of the crucial jobs for months and was deeply interested and involved in the selection process, administration officials said. And many of the nominees for coveted ambassadorships were offered the positions weeks or months ago. But the administration has delayed announcing the picks for several reasons. Instead of revealing the names one at a time, officials are planning to unveil a diverse slate of nominees, people involved in the process said. The administration is hoping to go beyond racial and gender diversity and focus on signaling to career Foreign Service officials that they are valued by whittling down the number of posts given to campaign donors. Another cause for delay is that many of the people who were selected are still completing time-consuming background checks and financial reviews as part of the rigorous vetting process. The Biden administration had initially hoped to move its first slate of nominees by mid-April, an official said. A White House official on Wednesday declined to comment on the timing and said that none of the names were final until the administration made an official announcement. Others in the running for key positions include Cindy McCain — the widow of Senator John McCain of Arizona — who is said to be Mr. Biden’s pick to serve as ambassador to the U.N. World Food Program, and Mark Gitenstein, a former ambassador to Romania and a close friend of Mr. Biden’s, who is said to be in consideration for ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Biden is also considering nominating Mark Brzezinski, who served as ambassador to Sweden during the Obama administration, as his ambassador to Poland, according to people familiar with the process. Mr. Brzezinski is the brother of Mika Brzezinski, a host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” and the son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter. — Annie Karni With a showdown coming over the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, Democrats are bumping up against the limits of what they can accomplish in the evenly divided Senate without changes to the filibuster rules. Republicans who see the commission as a threat to their midterm election hopes are poised to use the filibuster to block the inquiry as early as Thursday, underscoring the power of a Senate minority determined to kill legislation even if it is popular and has bipartisan support. It is the sort of clash lawmakers have been anticipating since January, when it was clear that it would be nearly impossible for Democrats to enact President Biden’s agenda unless they could do away with the 60-vote threshold for advancing legislation over the objections of any senator. With Memorial Day looming as an informal deadline for legislative progress, Senate Democrats have made no move to take up a sweeping voting rights bill, gun safety legislation, expansions of labor and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, a measure to overhaul policing, or legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants. Those bills have all passed the Democratic-led House. Activists want to see action on them soon, before what could be a short window of Democratic control of Congress and the White House comes to an end. “The next two months are going to be absolutely critical,” said Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for the anti-filibuster group Fix Our Senate. “We are going to find out whether Democrats are going to defend the filibuster or take the steps to defend our democracy.” — Carl Hulse The mother of a Capitol Police officer who died after clashing with pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6 lobbied Republican senators on Wednesday to drop their opposition to creating an independent commission to investigate the violent attack, warning that blocking the inquiry would be a “slap in the faces” of officers. In an unsparing statement, Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Officer Brian D. Sicknick, said her son and his fellow officers had paid a steep price defending the Capitol from “animals” targeting Congress and deserved a thorough accounting of what had happened. She planned to press her case face-to-face on Thursday, requesting meetings with every Republican senator before the vote, when they were expected to kill the commission. “I suggest that all congressmen and senators who are against this bill visit my son’s grave in Arlington National Cemetery and, while there, think about what their hurtful decisions will do to those officers who will be there for them going forward,” Ms. Sicknick said in the statement. “Putting politics aside, wouldn’t they want to know the truth of what happened on Jan. 6?” she said. “If not, they do not deserve to have the jobs they were elected to do.” The House approved the 10-person commission last week, with 35 Republicans joining Democrats in support. A handful of Republican senators — including Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — have indicated that they will also vote yes when Democrats put bipartisan legislation creating the commission on the floor as early as Thursday. One or two others could join them, depending on the fate of changes Ms. Collins has proposed. But Republican leaders are preparing to filibuster the legislation, fearing that a detailed investigation into an attack spurred on by President Donald J. Trump’s lies of a stolen election would churn up damaging revelations that could hurt their party politically. The last-minute lobbying by Ms. Sicknick recalled an intensive push by families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to resurrect a bill to create what became the 9/11 Commission after an initial version failed in the House. Their advocacy was seen as instrumental in the eventual creation of that inquiry, which is the model for the investigation that is now under consideration. Though it appeared unlikely to succeed, Ms. Sicknick’s efforts drew the attention of at least one prominent Republican, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Ms. Cheney voted in favor of the commission in the House days after Republicans ousted her from party leadership because she insisted on calling out Mr. Trump for his false claims that inspired the riot. “#ImwithGladys,” Ms. Cheney wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The medical examiner in Washington concluded that Officer Sicknick, 42, suffered multiple strokes in the hours after clashing with the rioters and died of natural causes. The Justice Department has charged two men with assault for spraying him with an unknown chemical. About 140 officers were injured that day, and two officers responding to the Capitol assault later died by suicide. — Nicholas Fandos Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary for the White House, held a televised briefing for the first time on Wednesday, a baptism-by-fire moment that came shortly after a mass shooting and a request from President Biden that U.S. intelligence officials delve deeper into the origins of the coronavirus. In her first outing, Ms. Jean-Pierre was immediately pushed for specifics about why Mr. Biden had ordered a 90-day review of the latest analysis on the virus, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. She offered none. “Right now we’re just going to focus on the president’s announcement on the 90-day investigation,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said when asked what would happen if Chinese officials refused to cooperate with investigations. “We will have more to share after the 90 days,” she said when asked whether the results of the investigation would be made public. Ms. Jean-Pierre showed little interest in getting ahead of the president or the administration, a tactic that is frustrating to reporters but drew praise from members of the administration, including Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff. “History made (and a job well done),” he wrote on Twitter. Ms. Jean-Pierre was the first Black woman in decades to address journalists on behalf of the president in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. (Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H.W. Bush, was the first Black spokeswoman to do so in 1991.) Her appearance at the podium on Wednesday was seen both internally and externally as an audition for the White House press secretary job. Jen Psaki, the current press secretary, recently said that she intended to leave the post after about a year. A former State Department spokeswoman, Ms. Psaki came to the job more battle-tested — and more familiar to the Washington press corps — than Ms. Jean-Pierre, who has worked on Democratic campaigns and as the chief public affairs officer at the liberal group MoveOn. Ms. Jean-Pierre, 43, is not the heir apparent to replace Ms. Psaki; other names put forth include Symone D. Sanders, the vice president’s press secretary, and Ned Price, the State Department spokesman. But Ms. Jean-Pierre has had frequent contact with the White House press corps in recent months. To get better acclimated to a White House where top officials tend to obsess over discipline in messaging, Ms. Jean-Pierre has delivered occasional news briefings aboard Air Force One, which is lower stakes than live television. She is almost always in the room when Ms. Psaki holds briefings, which has allowed her to familiarize herself with reporters. And the two are friendly: Before the door to the briefing room opens, they often do a dance to shake off their nerves, Ms. Psaki said in an interview with The Times in January. Ms. Jean-Pierre has made missteps along the way. When the White House rushed to publish an edited transcript this month, she mistakenly told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration supported Ukraine’s interest in joining NATO. But at other times, she has impressed members of Mr. Biden’s inner circle, including when she kept cool while speaking to reporters minutes after the president tripped twice while boarding his plane. “It’s very windy,” she told reporters. “I almost fell coming up the steps myself.” Ms. Jean-Pierre was asked on Wednesday what it meant to her to be the second Black woman in decades to deliver a formal briefing. “It’s a real honor to be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature, I really do,” she said. “But I believe that being behind this podium, being in this room, being in this building, is not about one person. It’s about what we do on behalf of the American people.” — Katie Rogers Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took a moment on Tuesday to thank the Biden administration for its support during his country’s 11-day conflict with Hamas in Gaza — and then abruptly changed the subject, and his tone. “We discussed many regional issues, but none is greater than Iran,” Mr. Netanyahu said, standing with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken after their meeting in Jerusalem. He pointedly added that he hoped the United States would not rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, “because we believe that that deal paves the way for Iran to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons with international legitimacy.” The Israeli leader’s remarks lent a sour note to his welcome of Mr. Blinken. And it undoubtedly echoed in Vienna, where a fifth round of negotiations aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, a top priority of President Biden’s, opened on Tuesday. The Gaza conflict appears to have earned Mr. Biden good will with Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli public. But the prospect of a U.S. return to the nuclear deal threatens to generate new strains between Washington and Jerusalem on a subject that poisoned relations between President Barack Obama and Mr. Netanyahu. “The big drama looms, and that is the Iran nuclear deal,” said Jonathan Schanzer, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “I think both Biden and Netanyahu realize that whatever discomfort both sides may have felt throughout this current conflict, it is small fries compared to the political friction that is looming.” Compounding the trouble is the conflict in Gaza, which has created anger in Israel and among Republicans in Congress over Iran’s ties to Palestinian militants. Most analysts say Iran played no active role in this month’s rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza, even though Tehran openly cheered them on. — Michael Crowley transcript “The purpose of today’s hearing is to show Americans their government is finally looking out for them, that we understand this economic system has betrayed millions of workers, that it holds our country back. Here’s what we want to hear from you today. What are you and the companies you run going to do, not just say, but actually do to change? We want to hear what concrete actions you’ll take to change the incentives on Wall Street to reward work instead of just rewarding wealth, to pay for and work to undo the damage that Wall Street has done and continues to do to communities of color.” “But I am concerned about increasing pressure on banks to embrace ‘wokeism’ and appease the far-left’s attacks on capitalism. And I worry that continuing down this path could lead to distorted credit allocation, activists seeking to make political change through the financial system instead of through the democratic process.” “The origins of this global crisis, unlike the last one, this is a public health crisis with severe economic consequences. And through this pandemic, Citi has shown we’re a very different bank than the one that entered the financial crisis more than a decade ago. We’re smaller, we’re safer, we’re stronger and we’re far less complex. And we have had the financial resources to support our clients and communities through this crisis.” “We’re able to help our clients and ultimately, the U.S. economy through the worst economic shock in recent history, while at the same time increasing investments in support of our teammates and our communities. For our clients, that included financial assistance for our business-as-usual work, and also helping to deliver the timely federal relief programs. We at Bank of America believe in capitalism, and it’s the best way to solve the challenges that are facing society. We operate by delivering great returns for our shareholders and delivering for society. We call that responsible growth.” The chief executives of the six biggest American lenders testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, the first time the committee has summoned all the top bankers since the financial crisis of 2008. (They will also appear at the House Committee on Financial Services on Thursday, for the first time since 2019.) At the Senate hearing, Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee’s chairman, pressed the bank chiefs on a range of subjects, sending them a list of questions on topics including the riskiness of their assets, the diversity of their work forces, actions on climate change, pledges on racial equity and more. It made for a disjointed hearing as senators veered from issue to issue, trying to catch the chief executives off guard or unprepared. Their prepared testimonies addressed the committee’s questions in varying depth and detail, while all making the case that their institutions had become healthier, safer and more law-abiding since 2008. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase turned in a nine-page paper urging business, government and society to address inequities and “unleash the extraordinary vibrancy of the American economy.” Jane Fraser of Citigroup prepared 11 pages (and a three-page addendum with data and tables) that noted her bank’s approach to cryptocurrencies, saying that it was “focusing resources and efforts to understand changes in the digital asset space.” James Gorman of Morgan Stanley assembled a 20-page report with few frills that included a short introduction and responses to each question in order. Charles Scharf of Wells Fargo and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs each submitted 15 pages heavy on environmental, social and governance issues. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America had the most to say, with 32 pages that devoted a lot of space to the bank’s “responsible growth” principles. “We embrace our dual responsibility to drive both profits and purpose,” he wrote. — Ephrat Livni Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the genteel former Navy secretary who shed the image of a dilettante to become a leading Republican voice on military policy during 30 years in the Senate, died on Tuesday night. He was 94. He died at his home of heart failure, according to a former staff member. Mr. Warner may have for a time been best known nationally as the dashing sixth husband of the actress Elizabeth Taylor. Her celebrity was a draw on the campaign trail during his difficult first race for the Senate in 1978, an election he won narrowly to start his political career. The couple divorced in 1982. In the latter stages of his congressional service, Mr. Warner was also recognized as a protector of the Senate’s traditions and was credited with trying to forge bipartisan consensus on knotty issues such as the Iraq war, judicial nominations and treatment of terror suspects. In retrospect, the senatorial Mr. Warner — with his shock of white hair, immaculate attire and unflagging politeness — represented a vanishing breed in his party, and particularly in his home state, which has become increasingly polarized since his retirement in 2009. He was a crossover candidate in a state where politicians in both parties had long gravitated to the center, offsetting the loss of conservative voters over the years with support from Democrats and independents. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden reflected on his time serving with Mr. Warner in the Senate. “I always knew that John’s decisions were guided by his values — even when we disagreed on the policy outcomes,” the president said. “When told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party’s position — as he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women’s rights and judicial nominees — that ‘people would say,’ his favorite rejoinder was, ‘Let ’em say it.’” “Indeed,” Mr. Biden added, “that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.” Mr. Warner served in the Navy briefly at the end of World War II. He then joined the Marines to fight in the Korean War, where he served as a ground aircraft maintenance officer, eventually reaching the rank of captain in the reserves. “I’m devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend John Warner,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia wrote on Twitter early Wednesday. “To me, he was the gold standard in Virginia. I will forever be grateful for his friendship and mentorship. I’ll miss you, John.” The younger Mr. Warner is a Democrat, and is not related to the elder Mr. Warner. But in a parting act of bipartisan comity, the elder Mr. Warner endorsed him when he retired from the Senate after the 2008 election. — Carl Hulse and Glenn Thrush",2021-05-26 12:58:16,Biden's Pick to Lead ATF Appears Before Senate Panel,,1,http://nytimes.com
74,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kv8ax/mass-shooting-plotter-souvannarath-allegedly-sending-prison-letters-to-influential-neo-nazi-and-is-calling-for-violence,"A woman serving a life sentence for a failed mass shooting plot in Halifax is alleged to have sent letters and art to an infamous neo-Nazi from prison calling for violence against “subhumans.” According to neo-Nazi James Mason, Lindsay Souvannarath, 29, gifted Mason letters and drawings that he posted on a far-right blog known to VICE World News. In the post, Mason, who penned the terrorism manual Siege in the 1980s that has since become sacrosanct in far-right terrorist circles, described Souvannarath as “quite the person of interest” who is “half Asian and half White” and the former girlfriend of another prominent neo-Nazi author. But Mason distanced himself from her crimes (as he has with others connected to his teachings). “She of course wasn’t able to carry out the attack and was caught prior and arrested by Canadian Police and later given a life sentence,” the blog reads. “These letters and art from Lindsay is not an endorsement of her actions.” Jordan Bonaparte, the host of The Nighttime Podcast, spoke to Lindsay from prison recently for a eight-part true crime series he did on the failed shooting. Bonaparte told VICE World News that while he was investigating the shooting, Souvannarath sent him several drawings and works similar to the ones sent to Mason; they even shared the same signature. “No question at all,” said Bonaparte. “It’s hers.” In February 2015, Souvannarath and her co-conspirators James Gamble and Randall Shepherd had planned to shoot up a food court at a mall in Halifax using Molotov cocktails, a hunting rifle, and a shotgun. According to an agreed statement of facts, “their intention was to inflict as many casualties as their ammunition would allow.” But the RCMP, Canada’s federal police force, received an anonymous tip that the three were planning the mass killing at a Halifax mall and arrested them. Gamble and Souvannarath, an online couple at the time, were the primary organizers of the plot and spoke so openly about their plan that they were thwarted by authorities. After flying to Halifax from the U.S. for the shooting, Souvannarath was arrested immediately upon touching down at the airport and Shepherd was arrested as he waited to pick her up. After a standoff with police, Gamble shot himself in the head, dying on the scene. In 2018, Souvannarath was sentenced to life in prison with no chance for parole in 10 years, and Shepherd was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Souvannarath is no stranger to neo-Nazi ideology. She had spent time online in the influential Nazi forum Iron March and even purportedly had an online relationship with the founder Alexander Slavros. During her trial, it emerged she was hoping to kill people she deemed sub-human during the planned spree. Do you have information about extremist groups? We’d love to hear from you. You can contact Mack Lamoureux and Ben Makuch securely on Wire at @benmakuch and @mlamoureux, or by email at mack.lamoureux@vice.com or ben.makuch@vice.com. The five handwritten pages attributed to Souvannarath were posted out of order on the blog and seem to belong to two distinct sets. One could best be described as an essay about the importance of the swastika. The other two pages, which go together but appear to be missing their beginning and conclusion, are about why violent action and hate crimes are needed. People who take part in violence are “superhumans,” the essay says. “They are the ones who take action and display courage who are willing to fight and even die for the cause... They are the so-called ‘terrorists,’ the gunmen and perpetrators of hate crimes that sow fear in a society of subhumans.” The drawings are done in a similar style to what was found on Souvannarath’s blogs and Deviant Art page. One depicts a man in a shirt with a skull associated with the defunct neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division holding a gun. In another, a woman is on the ground bleeding under the words “Time to Purge.” Souvannarath had a dramatic online path into extremism which included her corresponding with Nazis on art pages, participating in a forum known for giving rise to the Atomwaffen Division, and being a part of a community that venerated the Columbine school shooters. It was in the Columbine group that she met Gamble, the man she would spark an online relationship with and plan the killings. “Up until now it was easy to view her and (Gamble) as this laughable failure that was more a testament to attention-seeking than anything else,” said Bonaparte. “But now you got James Mason sharing her stuff, it just gives them an air of credibility.” According to Bonaparte, a small community has formed around the failed plot (Bonaparte spoke to one of these super fans in a recent episode). He told VICE World News that having this small fandom and getting her work amplified by an influential neo-Nazi could be “exactly what she wants and what she wanted from the beginning.” ""There is this fandom that is honestly exactly what she was hoping for,” said Bonaparte. “It's like a micro-version of what she was willing to kill for.” Follow Mack Lamoureux and Ben Makuch on Twitter.

80,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/us/san-jose-shooting/the-gunman-is-dead-the-police-said,"The gunman was found dead at a San Jose rail yard after he killed nine people, said the authorities in Santa Clara County, Calif. His home was ablaze during the attack. This briefing has ended. Follow the latest San Jose shooting updates. The nine victims were named by authorities. Gov. Gavin Newsom asks: ‘What the hell is wrong with us?’ ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. People who knew the suspect say he had a hostile personality. The gunman’s home was ablaze during the attack. A transit worker opened fire at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., early Wednesday, killing nine people, many of them fellow employees, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which reported that the gunman was also dead. California law enforcement officials identified the gunman as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade and whose suburban home was in flames as the shooting started. The attack — which occurred as dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were preparing for the start of the day’s service — spread turmoil through the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose, the nation’s 10th-largest city and the heart of Silicon Valley. Buildings were evacuated, and light rail service was gradually shut down as bomb squad teams scoured the area for explosives. Employees who had been working the busy morning shift were led to a separate building, where family members awaited. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California met with some of them. In an afternoon news conference, he praised sheriff’s deputies for their response to the shooting and lamented yet another American tragedy. “What the hell is wrong with us,” he said, “and when are we going to come to grips with this?” In a statement, President Biden urged Congress to take action on gun violence and said, “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. There are children, parents, and spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going to come home. There are union brothers and sisters — good, honest, hardworking people — who are mourning their own.” The medical examiner’s office in Santa Clara County identified the victims on Wednesday night as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Late Wednesday night, the medical examiner announced the death of a ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, who died at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. James Kostmayer, a San Jose County employee who works in the building where families were waiting to hear word about their loved ones, said the scene inside was “heartbreaking.” “You could hear the screams and cries of the families” from the elevator, he said, adding that he heard “a mother screaming, ‘My son, my son.’” Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said that police officers did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and that they believed he had killed himself. He also said they had no indication about a possible motive. In an interview, Connie Wang, 58, a former girlfriend of the suspect, said she had not seen or spoken to him in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable.” Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose said those who had known the suspect as a co-worker for years also “expressed generalized concerns about his mental health.” “This is a horrific day for our city,” Mr. Liccardo told reporters. “And it’s a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the authority’s board, noted that the authority’s work force of some 2,100 employees had been essential during the coronavirus pandemic, risking their health to provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of the Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice shaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” The violence was first reported at 6:34 a.m. in a corner of a large complex of municipal buildings. Officers were dispatched from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which is headquartered next door. Neil Vigdor contributed reporting. — Thomas Fuller, Christine Hauser, Kellen Browning and Shawn Hubler Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned the “rinse and repeat” cycle of mass shootings in America as he spoke to reporters on Wednesday about the killing of nine people at a rail yard in San Jose. There have been 68 mass shootings in the United States in the past two months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed. “It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Mr. Newsom said. “What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?” Mr. Newsom implored lawmakers to take action, and told all Americans to “take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments but the aftermath of these moments.” The number of mass shootings declined during much of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have become more frequent since March, when a gunman killed eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. Mr. Newsom called mass shootings a “pre-existing condition” that had once again “reared its ugly head.” The shooting in San Jose is believed to be the deadliest in the Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman used three semiautomatic pistols to kill eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco. — Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright The man identified by California law enforcement officials as the gunman in a mass shooting at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday lived alone and had a hostile personality, according to interviews with a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend, as well as a review of court records. The gunman, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, lived southeast of downtown San Jose, in a suburban neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and palm trees, public records show. Doug Suh, a real estate agent who lived across the street, described Mr. Cassidy, who authorities say appeared to have killed himself, as someone with a short temper. “I was afraid of him,” Mr. Suh said. “My wife was scared of him, too.” “He lived alone,” Mr. Suh said. “I never saw any friends or family. I never saw anyone else going into the house.” Mr. Suh recalled Mr. Cassidy once lashing out at him when Mr. Suh turned his car around in Mr. Cassidy’s driveway. “He yelled, ‘Do not come onto my driveway.’” Family court records show that Mr. Cassidy was married for 10 years before divorcing in 2004. The couple had no children. In 2009, Mr. Cassidy sought a restraining order against his former girlfriend, Jingkun Wang, known as Connie. In court filings, he accused her of vandalizing his roommate’s car, calling at late hours of the night, hurling insults and suggesting she had him under surveillance. Ms. Wang countered that Mr. Cassidy, whom she had dated for a year, had “major mood swings due to bipolar disorder” which were exacerbated when he consumed large quantities of alcohol. She also accused him of forcing himself on her sexually. Their relationship failed when he told her around February 2009 that a female houseguest had moved in, and that she should no longer come visit. She denied vandalizing any vehicles, and accused him of stealing items from restaurants and employers, and failing to return her television and computer printer. “He has manipulated me in many ways which are apparent to my friends and family,” she said. The court ordered Ms. Wang to stay at least 300 yards from him, his parents and his new girlfriend for three years. In a phone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Wang, now 58, said she had not spoken to Mr. Cassidy in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable,” who would be loving one moment and mean the next. She also described his drinking as excessive. They met on Match.com, Ms. Wang said. Two months into their relationship, he told her to pick a diamond ring and he would buy it, she recalled. She declined. After they broke up, Mr. Cassidy showed up at her apartment complex one day, Ms. Wang said. A neighbor let him in and he took her brand-new Toyota Camry, for which he had a key, without permission. He returned it damaged from what he told her was an accident, she said. — Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Thomas Fuller Andy and Alice Abad were in their kitchen Wednesday morning in southeastern San Jose when they saw a funnel of smoke pouring out of a neighbor’s home, a one-story gray house with white trim and a patchy lawn. Mr. Abad called 911 and was told that firefighters were already on the way. “The flames were above the rooftop,” Mr. Abad said. He took a picture of the house with his cellphone and headed out with his wife to a doctor’s appointment. When he returned home at noon, the neighborhood was swarming with fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. “What’s going on here?” Mr. Abad said as he stepped out of his car in his driveway. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, described a “strange connection” between the fire in the house and the attack on a rail yard near downtown that left nine people dead, including the gunman. The site of the shooting is eight miles away from the home, a 10- or 15-minute drive. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights of emergency vehicles that penetrated into the cul-de-sacs of what is described by residents as a quiet suburban neighborhood populated largely by Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. (The neighborhood is near Evergreen, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Members of the bomb squad walked past citrus and palm trees to enter the home as other law enforcement officers carried shovels and other garden implements into the property. The home on Wednesday afternoon was largely intact, but the crown of the roof was darkened by fire. — Thomas Fuller Families of Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority employees were directed to wait for news at a county building close to the rail yard. Jazmin Diaz arrived to find out if her brother, Max, who works for the authority, was OK. He doesn’t work at the part of the rail yard where the shooting occurred, she said, but had not answered his phone all morning. “I hope he’s good,” she said, pausing to take a phone call from a family member. “We believe that God protected him.” One man, who would not provide his name, arrived at the county building with his grandfather. He was hoping for news of his uncle, a light rail operator who he has not heard from all morning. “I never thought something like this would really happen,” the man said, before entering the building. “He has two little kids — that’s all I can think about right now.” Brandi Childress, a spokeswoman for the V.T.A., said she was informed at 6:45 a.m. local time that there was an “active shooter event.” Employees were on the job at that time, she said. “It is where we have dispatchers and maintenance,” she said. “They get up early and they are there. That is why the focus is on containing and evacuating employees. It is where we store and maintain all of our trains.” At about 1 p.m., at least 10 family groups emerged from the side of the county building, where Gov. Gavin Newsom of California stood in the doorway. Some, including a pair of women with their arms wrapped around a third woman, were escorted by security officers into a waiting bus. Loirena Ruico, who drove the bus to the nearby American Red Cross building, said the ride was somber. “It’s scary, it’s so tense — everyone’s crying,” she said. Outside the Red Cross center, Christina Gonzalez choked back tears as she waited for news of her cousin Michael Rudometkin. She said she left work and rushed to the center after her brother told her that Mr. Rudometkin was among the people who were shot. She said she had yet to learn anything about her cousin’s condition or where he was. “I’m just waiting and praying, and hoping he’s OK,” Ms. Gonzalez said. She said Mr. Rudometkin, who lives in Santa Cruz, was at a union meeting in the morning. “Very proud, loved his job and just always stood up for everyone’s rights,” she said of her cousin. “He is just a very good person, so we’re really hoping this isn’t the place to tell us the bad news.” By Wednesday evening, the county medical examiner’s office had released the names of the victims, including Mr. Rudometkin, 40. — Kellen Browning As dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail yard were preparing for the start of the day’s service, gunshots threw the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose into turmoil. Glenn Hendricks, the authority chairman, called the incident “a horrible tragedy” for its work force of some 2,100 mostly unionized employees, who provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice quaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” Transit service continued for several hours after the shooting without disruption, even as the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office — which is headquartered next door to the rail yard as part of a sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose — dispatched deputies to the scene of the shooting in a maintenance yard. “As I drove here,” Mr. Hendricks said, citing the dedication of the authority employees, “I saw buses on the road.” But service on the light-rail system’s three lines was later shut down as the maintenance facility became the scene of an active investigation. Mr. Hendricks said extra buses would be dispatched to cover for the canceled trains. He added that grief counseling would be made available to workers, including the 100 or so who were on the scene when the shooting erupted. Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said several of the people who were killed were V.T.A. employees, as was the gunman. “This is a horrific day for our city,” said the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, who also serves on the V.T.A. board. “And a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” — Shawn Hubler The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-26 13:15:20,"The gunman is dead, the police said.",,1,http://nytimes.com
81,https://dailycaller.com/2021/05/26/david-chipman-bidens-atf-nominee-ban-ar-15s/,"Screenshot via Facebook President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said during a confirmation hearing that he supports a ban on one of the most popular guns sold in the United States. “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban, as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president,” David Chipman told Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. The Ruger AR-556, a similar model to the Colt AR-15, was the best-selling semi-automatic rifle in the United States for the first five months of 2020, according to the National Shooting Sports Federation. (RELATED: Biden’s HHS Pick Thinks AR-15s Are ‘Not In Common Use For Self Defense’) “The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on ATF’s SWAT team and it’s a particularly lethal weapon and regulating it as other particularly lethal weapons I have advocated for,” Chipman continued. “So you want to ban the most popular rifle in America?” Cruz asked in reply. “A minute ago, you noted there is a Senate bill. Sen. Feinstein had a bill to ban some 2000 specified rifles and other firearms in her bill. In 2013, the Democrats had a majority in the Senate, Harry Reid’s Senate. And we voted on the Senate floor on Senator Feinstein’s so-called assault weapon ban. Do you know how many senators voted for it?”  “40. 60 voted against it. So in a Democratic Senate, a supermajority voted against a ban,” Cruz explained, after Chipman said he was not aware of the vote total “So you also said, when you and I talked yesterday in the office, that Sen. Feinstein’s bill, which a super majority of senators voted against in a Democratic Senate, you said that bill didn’t go far enough and you wanted an even broader ban. You said it didn’t go far enough. Is that right?” Cruz asked. Following the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting, Feinstein declared, “getting this bill signed into law will be an uphill battle, and I recognize that — but it’s a battle worth having.” However, a forensic scientist employed by the Bridgeport, Connecticut Police Department and the Connecticut state crime lab said that bans similar to what Feinstein proposed did not meaningfully impact gun violence. Senators voted against both the Feinstein proposal and an expanded background check amendment proposed by Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. “Sen. Feinstein’s bill did not address the firearms that are currently in the possession of Americans. And then I did share with you my view as an advocate, which would be quite different than someone actually enforcing the law on the books, that those firearms could be treated under the National Firearms Act and regulated that way, which would deal with those currently in the possession of Americans,” Chipman answered. Chipman currently works as a senior policy advisor for a gun control advocacy organization. He previously pushed the false claim that Branch Davidians shot down government helicopters during the 1993 Waco siege.

And, oh, did he ever deliver. Brosnan’s main takeaway was what he deemed a connection between mass murders and the continued rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations. The suspected shooter was almost certainly vaccinated, the Fox guest made sure to note. After the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department held a news conference confirming that there “multiple injuries and multiple fatalities,” including the suspected gunman, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner turned to Brosnan to ostensibly talk about the crime scene and law enforcement’s next steps. She also noted that the shooting took place near the sheriff’s department. Brosnan, a frequent Fox News guest, seemed more interested in centering this tragedy within the latest right-wing narratives on a recent rise in violent crime. “In a rational world where there is adherence to the rule of law and respect for law enforcement—say pre-the Summer of Love of 2020—I think there would be more nuanced response in terms of opening a shooting, an active shooting right next door to where there is a load of armed professional shooters under law enforcement,” he declared. “The rules have changed,” Brosnan added. “Crimes are no longer illegal. There is no longer enforcement of lots of laws and there’s an empowerment of these active shooters.” Having not-so-subtly suggested mass shooters appear to be emboldened by police-reform movements and social-justice protests, Brosnan then tied the growing rate of vaccinations in the United States to a year-long increase in gun violence. “This is a time I wish I was wrong with my prediction, which I mention to anybody who will listen, that once COVID starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations,” the ex-cop declared. “You can be sure they probably got vaccinated,” he added about the gunman who reportedly shot and killed himself. “They were scared to come out. Numbers don’t lie,” Brosnan concluded. “The shootings are up dramatically. Skyrocketing actually on active shootings throughout the United States as we have come through this pandemic. It is terrifying stuff.” Faulkner, meanwhile, did not follow up on any of Brosnan’s claims.",2021-05-26 13:21:28,Fox News ‘Expert’ Somehow Ties San Jose Mass Shooting to Vaccines,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/
83,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/heavy-police-presence-at-home-of-vta-employee-which-caught-fire-wednesday-morning/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — Samuel James Cassidy, a Valley Transportation Authority maintenance worker, walked out of his South San Jose home early Wednesday, a black bag in hand. Surveillance footage from a neighbor’s home shows him wearing what appears to be a work outfit, reflective tape on his torso, arms and legs as he unlocks his white truck, tosses the bag in and drives out of Angmar Court. Less than an hour later, firefighters were on the scene at his blazing home. At almost the same time, at a VTA rail yard miles away, Cassidy shot nine of his co-workers dead, then killed himself. Authorities have not said what might have led to the rampage or what type of weapon was used in the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. As the FBI and local authorities dig into his background, his ex-wife, neighbors and court records painted a picture of a man with a violent and unpredictable temper who often complained about being mistreated at work. In a 2009 court filing, an ex-girlfriend accused him of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol use. “He had two sides,” Cassidy’s ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, said outside her home Wednesday. “When he was in a good mood, he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad.” Nelms later tearfully told The Associated Press that Cassidy had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago, the news agency reported later Wednesday. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” Nelms said. A relative of Cassidy’s who answered her door Wednesday afternoon declined to comment and said she had to go take care of his parents. His father later told a reporter from inside his house, “I’m not talking to the press.” Neighbor Doug Suh described Cassidy as a “lonely guy.” Since moving to Angmar Court five years ago, Suh said he never saw any friends or family visiting Cassidy. “I’d say hello and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. “One day I was (crossing over his driveway while I backed out) and he yelled at me, ‘Don’t even go on my driveway!’ After that I never talked to him again.” Suh’s home surveillance camera captured the 57-year-old leaving his home. The time-stamped footage reviewed by a Bay Area News Group reporter shows Cassidy heading out at about 5:39 a.m. At about 6:36 a.m., a passerby called San Jose fire dispatch to report that Cassidy’s home was on fire. When firefighters arrived, the house was engulfed in flames, fire Battalion Chief Jeff Fielding said. The single-alarm blaze was reported just after the first calls came in about a shooting at the West Younger Avenue rail yard. Nine of Cassidy’s co-workers were killed. On Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the deceased victims as 42-year-old Paul Delacruz Megia, 36-year-old Taptejdeep Singh, 29-year-old Adrian Balleza, 35-year-old Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 49-year-old Timothy Michael Romo, 40-year-old Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 63-year-old Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63-year-old Lars Kepler Lane and 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. Officials were concerned about dangerous items that may have been brought in by Cassidy: Bomb-sniffing dogs signaled to handlers that an explosive device may have been placed inside a VTA building, leading to a lockdown and search. A Santa Clara County Sheriff’s statement issued Wednesday afternoon said only that “several possible suspicious devices” had been located on the property and that bomb squad personnel had “rendered the scene safe.” Officers and agents searching Cassidy’s home later Wednesday found weapons and a large amount of ammunition, sources told the Bay Area News Group. Explosive-sniffing dogs were also used at the house. Cassidy, a longtime San Jose resident, worked as a substation maintainer and previously as a mechanic for VTA. Before joining the transit agency about 20 years ago, he was a mechanic at a San Jose Mazda dealership. Over their 10-year marriage, Nelms said, Cassidy spoke angrily about his co-workers and bosses and at times directed his anger at her. When Cassidy was at the VTA during their marriage, he resented what he saw as unfair work assignments, she said, and would rant about his job when he got home. The couple divorced in 2005 and haven’t spoken in 13 years, she said. “He just thought that some people got more easy-going things at work, and he’d get the harder jobs,” she said. Nelms said she never knew Cassidy to have guns and struggled to connect the man she knew with Wednesday’s tragedy. But an ex-girlfriend described Cassidy as a violent person who tried to force her into sexual acts in 2009. “Several times during the relationship he became intoxicated, enraged and forced himself on me sexually,” the woman wrote in a sworn declaration. The Bay Area News Group does not name survivors of sexual abuse without their permission. On occasions where she refused him, the woman wrote, he “restrained me by holding my arms to my side and forcing his weight on top of me.” The volatile relationship lasted about a year. The woman, who was 45 at the time, detailed the allegations in response to a domestic violence restraining order Cassidy had filed against her, alleging harassment. “Each time I refused and was able to fight off his advances,” she wrote. “Afterwards, he would apologize for his behavior and promise it would not happen again.” Kate Selig contributed reporting.

It was the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting since 1993, when eight people and a gunman died in a skyscraper at 101 California Street in San Francisco. The rail service was shut down as authorities investigated the shooting, which left VTA workers, local and national leaders and community members shaken. “We are in a very dark moment, but I am heartened to see the response of the VTA family for coming together to help their coworkers,” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said in a press conference. “We are going to do everything we can to support the families of those who lost their loved ones.” Here’s what we know so far: A man opened gunfire just after 6:30 a.m. Wednesday somewhere in the VTA maintenance yard near the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. Other details — including the motive — remained unclear. Authorities have asked people to stay away from the area of E. Taylor Street, W. Hedding Street and E. Mission Street as they investigate. Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for the VTA operators union Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, said the shooting occurred during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service. Bomb-sniffing dogs alerted authorities to the possibility of explosives at the VTA facility in the 100 block of W. Younger Avenue, according to a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. Authorities confirmed at 11 a.m. that nine people had died, including the shooter. At least two male victims were transferred to Valley Medical Center in San Jose, spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. One person was pronounced dead on arrival and another was in critical condition. One VTA worker told this news organization at the scene of the shooting that “the whole crew is gone, the whole shift is gone,” but declined to say how many people that included. As of 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, the Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner had identified the deceased shooting victims: Multiple sources identified the shooter as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, a VTA maintenance worker. A heavy police presence was also spotted Wednesday morning outside a home where Cassidy apparently lived, where a house fire occurred. The fire left some minor soot damage to the outside of the home, according to witnesses. The single-alarm fire was reported at 6:36 a.m., around the time of the mass shooting. According to public records, a VTA substation employee lives at the home. In addition to local authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigations arrived on scene Wednesday morning. California has in place a “red-flag law” that allows family members and police officers to ask a court to block those believed to be at risk to themselves or others from processing firearms. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday outside of his office that he does not believe that law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. Yes. The VTA announced it would suspend its rail operations starting at noon Wednesday and replace the service with buses. An assistance area for families with relatives at the scene has been established at the Red Cross building located at 2731 N. First St. in San Jose. Families can call 408-299-2311 for information. The district attorney’s office is meanwhile still providing counseling and other services to the victims and witnesses at their office on San Jose’s W. Hedding Street.

A heavy police presence was also spotted Wednesday morning outside a home where Cassidy apparently lived, where a house fire occurred. The fire left some minor soot damage to the outside of the home, according to witnesses. The single-alarm fire was reported at 6:36 a.m., around the time of the mass shooting. According to public records, a VTA substation employee lives at the home. In addition to local authorities, the Federal Bureau of Investigations arrived on scene Wednesday morning. California has in place a “red-flag law” that allows family members and police officers to ask a court to block those believed to be at risk to themselves or others from processing firearms. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday outside of his office that he does not believe that law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. Yes. The VTA announced it would suspend its rail operations starting at noon Wednesday and replace the service with buses. An assistance area for families with relatives at the scene has been established at the Red Cross building located at 2731 N. First St. in San Jose. Families can call 408-299-2311 for information. The district attorney’s office is meanwhile still providing counseling and other services to the victims and witnesses at their office on San Jose’s W. Hedding Street.

86,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/us/san-jose-shooting/eight-people-were-killed-police-said-the-gunman-is-also-dead,"The gunman was found dead at a San Jose rail yard after he killed nine people, said the authorities in Santa Clara County, Calif. His home was ablaze during the attack. This briefing has ended. Follow the latest San Jose shooting updates. The nine victims were named by authorities. Gov. Gavin Newsom asks: ‘What the hell is wrong with us?’ ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. People who knew the suspect say he had a hostile personality. The gunman’s home was ablaze during the attack. A transit worker opened fire at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., early Wednesday, killing nine people, many of them fellow employees, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which reported that the gunman was also dead. California law enforcement officials identified the gunman as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade and whose suburban home was in flames as the shooting started. The attack — which occurred as dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were preparing for the start of the day’s service — spread turmoil through the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose, the nation’s 10th-largest city and the heart of Silicon Valley. Buildings were evacuated, and light rail service was gradually shut down as bomb squad teams scoured the area for explosives. Employees who had been working the busy morning shift were led to a separate building, where family members awaited. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California met with some of them. In an afternoon news conference, he praised sheriff’s deputies for their response to the shooting and lamented yet another American tragedy. “What the hell is wrong with us,” he said, “and when are we going to come to grips with this?” In a statement, President Biden urged Congress to take action on gun violence and said, “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. There are children, parents, and spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going to come home. There are union brothers and sisters — good, honest, hardworking people — who are mourning their own.” The medical examiner’s office in Santa Clara County identified the victims on Wednesday night as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Late Wednesday night, the medical examiner announced the death of a ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, who died at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. James Kostmayer, a San Jose County employee who works in the building where families were waiting to hear word about their loved ones, said the scene inside was “heartbreaking.” “You could hear the screams and cries of the families” from the elevator, he said, adding that he heard “a mother screaming, ‘My son, my son.’” Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said that police officers did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and that they believed he had killed himself. He also said they had no indication about a possible motive. In an interview, Connie Wang, 58, a former girlfriend of the suspect, said she had not seen or spoken to him in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable.” Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose said those who had known the suspect as a co-worker for years also “expressed generalized concerns about his mental health.” “This is a horrific day for our city,” Mr. Liccardo told reporters. “And it’s a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the authority’s board, noted that the authority’s work force of some 2,100 employees had been essential during the coronavirus pandemic, risking their health to provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of the Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice shaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” The violence was first reported at 6:34 a.m. in a corner of a large complex of municipal buildings. Officers were dispatched from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which is headquartered next door. Neil Vigdor contributed reporting. — Thomas Fuller, Christine Hauser, Kellen Browning and Shawn Hubler Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned the “rinse and repeat” cycle of mass shootings in America as he spoke to reporters on Wednesday about the killing of nine people at a rail yard in San Jose. There have been 68 mass shootings in the United States in the past two months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed. “It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Mr. Newsom said. “What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?” Mr. Newsom implored lawmakers to take action, and told all Americans to “take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments but the aftermath of these moments.” The number of mass shootings declined during much of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have become more frequent since March, when a gunman killed eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. Mr. Newsom called mass shootings a “pre-existing condition” that had once again “reared its ugly head.” The shooting in San Jose is believed to be the deadliest in the Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman used three semiautomatic pistols to kill eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco. — Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright The man identified by California law enforcement officials as the gunman in a mass shooting at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday lived alone and had a hostile personality, according to interviews with a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend, as well as a review of court records. The gunman, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, lived southeast of downtown San Jose, in a suburban neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and palm trees, public records show. Doug Suh, a real estate agent who lived across the street, described Mr. Cassidy, who authorities say appeared to have killed himself, as someone with a short temper. “I was afraid of him,” Mr. Suh said. “My wife was scared of him, too.” “He lived alone,” Mr. Suh said. “I never saw any friends or family. I never saw anyone else going into the house.” Mr. Suh recalled Mr. Cassidy once lashing out at him when Mr. Suh turned his car around in Mr. Cassidy’s driveway. “He yelled, ‘Do not come onto my driveway.’” Family court records show that Mr. Cassidy was married for 10 years before divorcing in 2004. The couple had no children. In 2009, Mr. Cassidy sought a restraining order against his former girlfriend, Jingkun Wang, known as Connie. In court filings, he accused her of vandalizing his roommate’s car, calling at late hours of the night, hurling insults and suggesting she had him under surveillance. Ms. Wang countered that Mr. Cassidy, whom she had dated for a year, had “major mood swings due to bipolar disorder” which were exacerbated when he consumed large quantities of alcohol. She also accused him of forcing himself on her sexually. Their relationship failed when he told her around February 2009 that a female houseguest had moved in, and that she should no longer come visit. She denied vandalizing any vehicles, and accused him of stealing items from restaurants and employers, and failing to return her television and computer printer. “He has manipulated me in many ways which are apparent to my friends and family,” she said. The court ordered Ms. Wang to stay at least 300 yards from him, his parents and his new girlfriend for three years. In a phone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Wang, now 58, said she had not spoken to Mr. Cassidy in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable,” who would be loving one moment and mean the next. She also described his drinking as excessive. They met on Match.com, Ms. Wang said. Two months into their relationship, he told her to pick a diamond ring and he would buy it, she recalled. She declined. After they broke up, Mr. Cassidy showed up at her apartment complex one day, Ms. Wang said. A neighbor let him in and he took her brand-new Toyota Camry, for which he had a key, without permission. He returned it damaged from what he told her was an accident, she said. — Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Thomas Fuller Andy and Alice Abad were in their kitchen Wednesday morning in southeastern San Jose when they saw a funnel of smoke pouring out of a neighbor’s home, a one-story gray house with white trim and a patchy lawn. Mr. Abad called 911 and was told that firefighters were already on the way. “The flames were above the rooftop,” Mr. Abad said. He took a picture of the house with his cellphone and headed out with his wife to a doctor’s appointment. When he returned home at noon, the neighborhood was swarming with fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. “What’s going on here?” Mr. Abad said as he stepped out of his car in his driveway. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, described a “strange connection” between the fire in the house and the attack on a rail yard near downtown that left nine people dead, including the gunman. The site of the shooting is eight miles away from the home, a 10- or 15-minute drive. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights of emergency vehicles that penetrated into the cul-de-sacs of what is described by residents as a quiet suburban neighborhood populated largely by Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. (The neighborhood is near Evergreen, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Members of the bomb squad walked past citrus and palm trees to enter the home as other law enforcement officers carried shovels and other garden implements into the property. The home on Wednesday afternoon was largely intact, but the crown of the roof was darkened by fire. — Thomas Fuller Families of Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority employees were directed to wait for news at a county building close to the rail yard. Jazmin Diaz arrived to find out if her brother, Max, who works for the authority, was OK. He doesn’t work at the part of the rail yard where the shooting occurred, she said, but had not answered his phone all morning. “I hope he’s good,” she said, pausing to take a phone call from a family member. “We believe that God protected him.” One man, who would not provide his name, arrived at the county building with his grandfather. He was hoping for news of his uncle, a light rail operator who he has not heard from all morning. “I never thought something like this would really happen,” the man said, before entering the building. “He has two little kids — that’s all I can think about right now.” Brandi Childress, a spokeswoman for the V.T.A., said she was informed at 6:45 a.m. local time that there was an “active shooter event.” Employees were on the job at that time, she said. “It is where we have dispatchers and maintenance,” she said. “They get up early and they are there. That is why the focus is on containing and evacuating employees. It is where we store and maintain all of our trains.” At about 1 p.m., at least 10 family groups emerged from the side of the county building, where Gov. Gavin Newsom of California stood in the doorway. Some, including a pair of women with their arms wrapped around a third woman, were escorted by security officers into a waiting bus. Loirena Ruico, who drove the bus to the nearby American Red Cross building, said the ride was somber. “It’s scary, it’s so tense — everyone’s crying,” she said. Outside the Red Cross center, Christina Gonzalez choked back tears as she waited for news of her cousin Michael Rudometkin. She said she left work and rushed to the center after her brother told her that Mr. Rudometkin was among the people who were shot. She said she had yet to learn anything about her cousin’s condition or where he was. “I’m just waiting and praying, and hoping he’s OK,” Ms. Gonzalez said. She said Mr. Rudometkin, who lives in Santa Cruz, was at a union meeting in the morning. “Very proud, loved his job and just always stood up for everyone’s rights,” she said of her cousin. “He is just a very good person, so we’re really hoping this isn’t the place to tell us the bad news.” By Wednesday evening, the county medical examiner’s office had released the names of the victims, including Mr. Rudometkin, 40. — Kellen Browning As dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail yard were preparing for the start of the day’s service, gunshots threw the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose into turmoil. Glenn Hendricks, the authority chairman, called the incident “a horrible tragedy” for its work force of some 2,100 mostly unionized employees, who provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice quaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” Transit service continued for several hours after the shooting without disruption, even as the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office — which is headquartered next door to the rail yard as part of a sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose — dispatched deputies to the scene of the shooting in a maintenance yard. “As I drove here,” Mr. Hendricks said, citing the dedication of the authority employees, “I saw buses on the road.” But service on the light-rail system’s three lines was later shut down as the maintenance facility became the scene of an active investigation. Mr. Hendricks said extra buses would be dispatched to cover for the canceled trains. He added that grief counseling would be made available to workers, including the 100 or so who were on the scene when the shooting erupted. Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said several of the people who were killed were V.T.A. employees, as was the gunman. “This is a horrific day for our city,” said the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, who also serves on the V.T.A. board. “And a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” — Shawn Hubler The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-26 13:57:10,"Eight people were killed, police said.

While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.

88,https://www.startribune.com/man-charged-with-2-counts-of-murder-7-attempted-murder-counts-in-minneapolis-nightclub-shootout/600061484/,"A 24-year-old man was charged Wednesday with murder and attempted murder in the mass shooting outside a downtown Minneapolis nightclub over the weekend that left two people dead and seven wounded in a brief but furious gun battle. Jawan C. Carroll of St. Paul remained jailed on nine counts in lieu of $1 million bail before a court appearance Thursday. On Monday, the two people fatally shot outside the Monarch club in the 300 block of N. 1st Avenue were identified as Christopher R. Jones Jr., 24, of Brooklyn Park and Charlie B. Johnson, 21, of Golden Valley. Jones died while exchanging gunfire with Carroll on the crowded sidewalk shortly before 2 a.m. Saturday, according to the charges. Jones was shot twice in the chest and elsewhere, the Medical Examiner's Office disclosed. Johnson was shot in the back before 2 a.m. Saturday while fleeing the chaotic scene on a warm spring night, the charges read. Among the seven others who were wounded — four women and three men — one was reported to be in critical condition. The most seriously wounded was a woman shot in the cheek and neck with another shot coming within an inch of her skull, according to the charges. A man took three shots in the shoulder and buttocks. Another man was grazed under his right eye. ""The night of the shooting, seven homicide detectives came in along with multiple members of the shoot team,"" police spokesman John Elder said Wednesday afternoon. ""They worked side by side with patrol officers [and] assault detectives through the night to put this complex case together."" Steve Cramer, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, said the ability of police to make sense of such an unwieldy set of circumstances in order to make an arrest was exemplary. ""What's not debatable ... is what they did in this case to hold people accountable for their behavior,"" he said. ""It's a critical function that the 'defund the police' crowd doesn't have an answer for."" The casualty-laden bloodshed outside the Monarch club accounted for two of four people slain in the city over the weekend, prompting police to bring in outside help to try to deal with the violence. There have been 32 homicides in the city so far this year, following an especially deadly 2020, when 84 people were slain. The 2019 total was 48. As of the weekend, more than 190 people had been killed or wounded in shooting incidents, compared with about 75 at this point in 2020, according to Police Department data. The call for additional law enforcement also comes after three children, 11 years old and younger, were hit by gunfire in recent weeks, killing one and seriously injuring two. No arrests have been made in any of those cases. Cramer, whose council represents the interests of many businesses, said the entire reputation of downtown is on the line, even though this mass shooting was confined to one specific block well after most entertainment and dining locales had closed for the night. ""People don't always distinguish the situation at bar close at 2 a.m. and business hours or during a Twins game,"" said Cramer, who served on the City Council from 1984 to 1993. ""These incidents are going to have a spillover effect on the entirety of downtown."" Johnson was visiting downtown with friends Friday night to celebrate their graduation the next day from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. They were walking home when the gunfire erupted, his father, Greg Johnson, said Sunday. According to the criminal complaint: Video surveillance outside the nightclub showed Carroll shooting at Jones. Police recognized Carroll in the video from previous encounters with law enforcement and know him as associated with the Tre Tres street gang. Earlier images from the surveillance video showed Carroll ""and several companions"" on the sidewalk just south of the club. Carroll's group then had ""verbal exchanges"" with a group including Jones. Someone with Carroll punched Jones in the head, then Carroll opened fire on Jones at close range. Carroll kept firing as Jones ran toward the Monarch entrance. Just before reaching the entrance, Jones turned and returned gunfire at Carroll. Carroll kept firing, prompting two other men to shoot back. Carroll kept firing although bystanders were in harm's way. Jones fell to the sidewalk less than 10 seconds after the first shots were fired. A friend of Johnson's said the two of them had just stepped out of an alley near the Monarch and onto the sidewalk when the gunfire erupted. Johnson fled down the street and was shot in the back, struggled for a bit and then fell to the spot where he died. Several hours after the shooting, investigators tracked Carroll to Bloomington and arrested him soon after he drove from a hotel. Carroll's criminal history in Minnesota includes several pending felony cases, among them second-degree assault and fleeing police in a vehicle.

92,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/fox-news-guest-ties-san-jose-shooting-and-rise-in-gun-violence-to-covid-vaccinations/,"Trending: A Fox News Channel guest on Wednesday provoked social media backlash and disbelief after he delivered an unusual take on the San Jose mass shootings, declaring that the incident — and this year’s rise in gun violence — can somehow be tied to COVID-19 vaccination rates. “Once COVID starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations,” Pat Brosnan, a former cop, told Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner. “You can be sure they probably got vaccinated,” he added, referring to the gunman who reportedly shot and killed himself. Brosnan, a retired New York City Police Department detective, is a frequent Fox News guest and has on several occasions opined that protests over police violence threaten an increase in crime in America. In the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s shooting at the Valley Transportation Authority rail yard, he was called upon to offer his analysis on the developing situation. Brosnan first connected the shooting that left nine dead to an overall “lack of enforcement” of laws and a lack of respect for law enforcement, which he appeared to connect to the protests over the death of George Floyd, BLM and the “defund the police” movement. “In a rational world where there is adherence to the rule of law and respect for law enforcement—say pre-the Summer of Love of 2020—I think there would be more nuanced response in terms of opening a shooting, an active shooting right next door to where there is a load of armed professional shooters under law enforcement,” he declared. “The rules have changed. Crimes are no longer illegal,” he said. “… There’s an empowerment of these active shooters.” He then claimed, with no evidence or factual verification, that as vaccination rates rise, more mass shootings are bound to occur because potential shooters were previously too afraid of COVID-19 to commit violence in public. “They were just scared to come out. And you see the numbers don’t lie,” Brosnan said, without offering any specific statistics. “The shootings are up dramatically. Skyrocketing, actually, on active shootings throughout the United States as we have come through this pandemic. It is terrifying stuff.” On social media, Brosnan’s comments were met with a mix of bewilderment and anger. Justin Baragona, who frequently comments on media matters called it a “weird takeaway.” San Francisco author Steve Silberman tweeted that “by this point, if you work for @FoxNews, you’re actively threatening the lives of your children by enabling this BS. …” Others on Twitter simply referred to Brosnan’s comments as “baseless” and “deranged.” This seems like a weird takeaway from the San Jose mass shooting.

Developed nations all over the world are vaccinating their citizens, and yet, only in America are more than 100 people being shot to death every day.

And you see the numbers don’t lie,” Brosnan said, without offering any specific statistics. “The shootings are up dramatically. Skyrocketing, actually, on active shootings throughout the United States as we have come through this pandemic. It is terrifying stuff.” On social media, Brosnan’s comments were met with a mix of bewilderment and anger. Justin Baragona, who frequently comments on media matters called it a “weird takeaway.” San Francisco author Steve Silberman tweeted that “by this point, if you work for @FoxNews, you’re actively threatening the lives of your children by enabling this BS. …” Others on Twitter simply referred to Brosnan’s comments as “baseless” and “deranged.” This seems like a weird takeaway from the San Jose mass shooting.

The suspect was an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority, which provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the largest county in the Bay Area, authorities said. The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive. The shooting took place around 6:30 a.m. at a light rail facility that includes a transit-control center, parking for trains and a maintenance yard. Sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Russell Davis said the attack also resulted in “multiple major injuries.” He did not know the type of weapon used. He said the victims included VTA employees. Authorities did not release any of the victims’ names. “These folks were heroes during COVID-19. The buses never stopped running, VTA didn’t stop running. They just kept at work, and now we’re really calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy,” Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said it was his understanding the shooting happened inside the VTA building. Victims’ grief-stricken families sat huddled together, holding hands and crying, after learning they had lost a loved one, Rosen told reporters, describing the scene inside a county building. “They’re just sitting and holding hands and crying,” Rosen said. “It’s terrible. It’s awful. It’s raw. People are learning they lost their husband, their son, their brother.” He said about 100 people were inside the family reunification center. Police vehicles and orange crime-scene tape blocked off the area, and reporters were kept at a distance The rail yard is in the city’s administrative neighborhood, near the sheriff’s office and city and county offices. Bomb squads were searching the rail complex after receiving information about possible explosive devices inside the building, Davis said. Officials were also investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned a two-story home where firefighters responded Wednesday morning. VTA trains were already out on morning runs when the shooting occurred. Light rail service was to be suspended at noon and replaced with bus bridges, agency Chairman Glenn Hendricks told a news conference. “It’s just very difficult for everyone to be able try to wrap their heads around and understand what has happened,” Hendricks said. Outside the scene, Michael Hawkins told The Mercury News that he was waiting for his mother, Rochelle Hawkins, who had called him from a co-worker’s phone to assure him that she was safe. When the shooting started, “she got down with the rest of her coworkers” and dropped her cellphone, Michael Hawkins told the newspaper. Rochelle Hawkins did not see the shooter, and she was not sure how close she had been to the attacker, her son said. San Jose, the 10th-largest city in the U.S. with more than a million people, is about 50 miles south of San Francisco in the heart of Silicon Valley. In the city itself, the most recent mass shooting occurred in 2019 at a private home, according to The Mercury News, in what police said was a quadruple murder and suicide precipitated by family conflict. Wednesday’s attack was the county’s second shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people before killing himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019. At a news conference, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo lamented the “horrific day for our city.” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a tweet that his office was “in close contact with local law enforcement and monitoring this situation closely.” Agents from the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were responding to the crime scene, officials said. © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

A mass shooting at a Northern California rail yard Wednesday morning ended with nine people dead – including the shooter – and multiple people injured, officials confirmed. Authorities identified the suspected shooter as Samuel Cassidy, 57, a Valley Transportation Authority employee who was declared dead after taking his own life. No motive is known for the shooting at this time. The VTA provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the largest in the Bay Area and home to Silicon Valley. CALIFORNIA FAMILY MEMBERS HOLD VIGIL FOR BOY, 6, SHOT DEAD IN APPARENT ROAD-RAGE INCIDENT The rampage took place around 6:30 a.m. at a light rail facility in San Jose, next door to the sheriff’s department and across a freeway from the airport. The facility is a transit control center that stores trains and has a maintenance yard. Inquiries to the VTA about Cassidy's employment with the agency were not immediately returned. He was reportedly a technician at the yard, FOX affiliate KTVU-TV reported. Cassidy's ex-wife told the news outlet the couple divorced in 2009 and that her interaction with him since the divorce had been limited. An ex-girlfriend told the San Francisco Chronicle he was prone to alcohol-fueled mood swings and had been accused in a March 2009 court filing of rape and abuse. The documents were filed in response to a domestic violence restraining order that Cassidy had filed earlier that month. The former girlfriend alleged his mood swings worsened when he drank alcohol and that he played ""several mind games which he seems to enjoy."" She listed several incidents of alleged sexual assault in which he would hold her arms and force his weight onto her. He would apologize to never do it again afterward, the report said. Authorities also responded to his home in the 1100 block of Angmar Court in San Jose amid reports of a fire. They said the residence caught fire before the shooting. Multiple weapons were reportedly found inside, the Los Angeles Times reported. Santa Clara County Sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Russell Davis said several explosive devices were found inside a building at the VTA control center. A bomb squad is at the scene and there is no present danger to the community. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The attack was the county’s second shooting in less than two years.

If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost.""

98,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/26/karine-jean-pierre-white-house-press-briefing-biden,"Jean-Pierre becomes first openly gay person to brief White House press corps and first Black woman to do so in 30 years Last modified on Wed 26 May 2021 22.57 BST “Hi, everybody! Welcome!” So, with a rustle of papers, began a new chapter in the White House briefing room on Wednesday when Karine Jean-Pierre became the first openly gay person to address reporters on behalf of the US president.  She was also the first Black woman to do so since Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H W Bush – and inspiration for Olivia Pope in the TV drama Scandal – stood at the podium some 30 years ago. The briefing was widely seen as an audition by Jean-Pierre, who is currently principal deputy press secretary, for the top job of presidential spokesperson. The incumbent, Jen Psaki, who has been briefing almost daily, said recently she intends to leave the post after a year. Did Jean-Pierre pass the audition? Joe Biden will be the ultimate judge of that but it would fair to say that she observed the first rule for press secretaries: do no harm. Her replies were noncommittal, uncontroversial and not likely to generate unwanted headlines. Wearing canary yellow as she faced a half-full room of journalists due to coronavirus restrictions, Jean-Pierre was given an early test of her ability to respond to breaking news: a mass shooting in San Jose, California. She took a little longer than is customary to flick through a hefty briefing book and find the relevant statement. Her own significance – born in Martinique to Haitian immigrants, she could hardly strike more of a contrast from Donald Trump’s four white press secretaries – inevitably came up during questions. Jean-Pierre replied: “It’s a real honor to be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature, I really do, but I believe that being behind this podium, being in this room, being in this building is not about one person. It’s about what we do on behalf of the American people.” She added: “Clearly the president believes that representation matters, and I appreciate him giving me this opportunity, and it’s another reason why I think we are all so proud that this is the most diverse administration in history.” Jean-Pierre is already a veteran of politics, activism and media. In graduate school, her website notes, she explored her Haitian roots through a documentary film and later worked at the Center for Community and Corporate Ethics, pushing big companies such as Walmart to change their business practices. Her employers in Democratic politics present a mixed picture. She served as press secretary to Congressman Anthony Weiner of New York, later jailed for sending sexually explicit text messages to a minor, and worked on the presidential election campaign of John Edwards, who also fell from grace in a sex scandal. On a happier note, Jean-Pierre was deputy battleground states director for Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign and served in the Obama White House as regional political director for the Office of Political Affairs. Jean-Pierre took on the role of chief public affairs officer for the liberal grassroots organization MoveOn.org where she said in one video: “I am everything that Donald Trump hates. I’m a Black woman, I’m gay, I am a mom. Both my parents were born in Haiti.” When, at a MoveOn.org event in June 2019, an animal rights protester leaped on stage and tried to seize then senator Kamala Harris’s microphone. Jean-Pierre was quick out of her chair to intervene and shoo him away, objecting: “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!” She went on to serve as Harris’s chief of staff during the presidential election campaign. She has also taught a course at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and frequently appeared as a political analyst on the NBC and MSNBC networks – such TV experience is always valuable training for the press secretary job. Since joining the Biden White House, Jean-Pierre has been a fixture in the room for Psaki’s briefings and has sometimes delivered her own, away from the cameras, aboard Air Force One. Psaki told the New York Times that, before the door to the briefing room slides open, both women often do a dance to shake off their nerves.",2021-05-26 15:46:14,‘It’s a real honor’: Karine Jean-Pierre makes history at White House briefing,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

X OUR PICKS: A St. Paul man is accused of killing two people, including a University of St. Thomas student, and wounding seven others during a downtown Minneapolis shootout last weekend. Jawan Contrail Carroll, 24, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and seven counts of attempted second-degree murder, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court. Carroll, who is in custody, is scheduled to make his first appearance before a judge Thursday afternoon. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 220 years in prison. No attorney was listed for Carroll in court documents. The criminal complaint against Carroll says he and a Brooklyn Park man exchanged gunfire early Saturday morning outside the Monarch nightclub, catching several other people in the crossfire. The other gunman was killed in the shootout, as was 21-year-old Charlie Johnson, a University of St. Thomas student who was set to graduate hours later. Police responded to the sound of gunfire about 2 a.m. Saturday in front of the nightclub in the 300 block of First Avenue, where they found nine people suffering from gunshot wounds, according to the criminal complaint. Among the injured were Johnson and 24-year-old Christopher R. Jones Jr., who were both pronounced dead at the scene. The other victims survived their wounds. Near Jones’ body, officers found a 9mm handgun and several shell casings, the complaint said. Investigators reviewed surveillance footage of the incident, which showed Carroll and two companions talking to another group of people, which included Jones, on the crowded sidewalk in front of the club. During the exchange, a member of Carroll’s group punched Jones in the head, while Carroll drew a handgun and began firing at Jones from less than five feet away, according to the complaint. Jones turned to run, but his escape was blocked by the crowd of bystanders, who were scrambling to avoid the shots, the complaint said. Near the club’s entrance, Jones drew a handgun and began returning fire at Carroll from about 20 feet away, according to the complaint. A couple of seconds later, Jones fell to the sidewalk where he died and Carroll fled the scene. Investigators recognized Carroll from prior encounters as being associated with “a violent North Minneapolis street gang” called the Tre Tres, and they arrested him a short time later, the complaint said. A witness who was with Johnson that night told police they were walking through the alley behind the club and stepped onto the sidewalk just as the shooting began. The witness said Johnson was struck in the back as he ran from the shots. Based on autopsy findings and ballistics evidence, investigators determined that bullets from Carroll’s .40-caliber handgun caused the injuries that killed Jones and Johnson, as well as the non-fatal injuries to seven other bystanders, according to the complaint. Johnson, an engineering student who was to receive his diploma the same day he was killed, was out celebrating his graduation with friends when the shooting occurred, his parents told KARE-TV. “I miss my baby,” Johnson’s mother, Veronique Johnson, told the station. “I’m so proud of him.” Johnson’s sister accepted his diploma on his behalf, according to KMSP-TV. “He was the best of each of us put into one,” Johnson’s father, Greg Johnson, told KARE. “So, if we all could try to be a little more like Charlie, the world would be a better place.” This report includes information from the Associated Press.

103,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/26/editorial-san-jose-mass-shooting-demands-action-on-gun-control/,"Trending: The United States has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate of any of the world’s most developed nations. The mass shooting Wednesday morning that killed nine people and injured others at the Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard in San Jose follows 12 mass shootings across the United States last weekend. All told, as of Wednesday, according to the Gun Control Archive, there have been 231 mass shootings in the United States in the first 146 days of 2021, killing 260 people and injuring 864. That’s unacceptable. Two hundred and thirty one mass shootings this year. Twelve mass shootings in a single weekend. In a nation where a 2020 Gallup Poll showed that 96% of Americans favored universal background checks on gun purchases. Bay Area residents and Americans across the nation must demand that Congress take action on meaningful gun control legislation. Even as the tragedy in San Jose was unfolding, the Senate Judiciary Committee was holding a confirmation hearing for David Chipman, President Biden’s choice to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Chipman, a two-decade veteran of the ATF, was picked by Biden to give life to the gun control effort. The ATF is the main agency that enforces federal gun laws, but it hasn’t had a confirmed director since 2015. The ATF has had only one director since Congress approved the position in 2006, primarily because of strong opposition from the National Rifle Association. Chipman has been an outspoken advocate for gun-violence prevention, including an assault-style weapons ban. The hope is that if he is confirmed, his presence will help Congress see the light on sensible gun control laws. The Senate is expected to take up legislation that would close the loopholes on background checks for sales of firearms or requiring waiting periods before purchases to prevent impulsive violence. The House has already passed two bills that would accomplish those goals. In 1994, Congress passed the Brady Background Check System, which is credited with preventing an estimated 4 million prohibited gun transactions. But the legislation did not require background checks on gun purchases by private parties, including sales made online or at gun shows, where about 20% of gun sales occur. It also included a provision that allowed gun purchases to go through if the background check process was not completed within three days. That’s the loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to buy a gun he was barred from owning — the same gun he used in 2015 to kill nine Black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. It was not known as of Wednesday afternoon what weapon the San Jose shooter used or whether it was legally purchased. Regardless, the background check legislation needs to be approved and sent to the president for his signature. That will require a minimum of 10 Republicans to overcome an expected filibuster in the Senate. The legislation deserves widespread GOP support. The Gallup Poll revealed that 84% of Republicans support background checks for gun sales at gun shows and online purchases. And 69% of NRA members back the expanded background checks for firearms sales. Given that level of support, Congress should find the courage to end the political stalemate on background checks and help keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business possessing a firearm.

His home was ablaze during the attack. This briefing has ended. Follow the latest San Jose shooting updates. The nine victims were named by authorities. Gov. Gavin Newsom asks: ‘What the hell is wrong with us?’ ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. People who knew the suspect say he had a hostile personality. The gunman’s home was ablaze during the attack. A transit worker opened fire at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., early Wednesday, killing nine people, many of them fellow employees, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which reported that the gunman was also dead. California law enforcement officials identified the gunman as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade and whose suburban home was in flames as the shooting started. The attack — which occurred as dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were preparing for the start of the day’s service — spread turmoil through the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose, the nation’s 10th-largest city and the heart of Silicon Valley. Buildings were evacuated, and light rail service was gradually shut down as bomb squad teams scoured the area for explosives. Employees who had been working the busy morning shift were led to a separate building, where family members awaited. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California met with some of them. In an afternoon news conference, he praised sheriff’s deputies for their response to the shooting and lamented yet another American tragedy. “What the hell is wrong with us,” he said, “and when are we going to come to grips with this?” In a statement, President Biden urged Congress to take action on gun violence and said, “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. There are children, parents, and spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going to come home. There are union brothers and sisters — good, honest, hardworking people — who are mourning their own.” The medical examiner’s office in Santa Clara County identified the victims on Wednesday night as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Late Wednesday night, the medical examiner announced the death of a ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, who died at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. James Kostmayer, a San Jose County employee who works in the building where families were waiting to hear word about their loved ones, said the scene inside was “heartbreaking.” “You could hear the screams and cries of the families” from the elevator, he said, adding that he heard “a mother screaming, ‘My son, my son.’” Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said that police officers did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and that they believed he had killed himself. He also said they had no indication about a possible motive. In an interview, Connie Wang, 58, a former girlfriend of the suspect, said she had not seen or spoken to him in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable.” Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose said those who had known the suspect as a co-worker for years also “expressed generalized concerns about his mental health.” “This is a horrific day for our city,” Mr. Liccardo told reporters. “And it’s a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the authority’s board, noted that the authority’s work force of some 2,100 employees had been essential during the coronavirus pandemic, risking their health to provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of the Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice shaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” The violence was first reported at 6:34 a.m. in a corner of a large complex of municipal buildings. Officers were dispatched from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which is headquartered next door. Neil Vigdor contributed reporting. — Thomas Fuller, Christine Hauser, Kellen Browning and Shawn Hubler Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned the “rinse and repeat” cycle of mass shootings in America as he spoke to reporters on Wednesday about the killing of nine people at a rail yard in San Jose. There have been 68 mass shootings in the United States in the past two months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed. “It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Mr. Newsom said. “What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?” Mr. Newsom implored lawmakers to take action, and told all Americans to “take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments but the aftermath of these moments.” The number of mass shootings declined during much of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have become more frequent since March, when a gunman killed eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. Mr. Newsom called mass shootings a “pre-existing condition” that had once again “reared its ugly head.” The shooting in San Jose is believed to be the deadliest in the Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman used three semiautomatic pistols to kill eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco. — Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright The man identified by California law enforcement officials as the gunman in a mass shooting at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday lived alone and had a hostile personality, according to interviews with a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend, as well as a review of court records. The gunman, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, lived southeast of downtown San Jose, in a suburban neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and palm trees, public records show. Doug Suh, a real estate agent who lived across the street, described Mr. Cassidy, who authorities say appeared to have killed himself, as someone with a short temper. “I was afraid of him,” Mr. Suh said. “My wife was scared of him, too.” “He lived alone,” Mr. Suh said. “I never saw any friends or family. I never saw anyone else going into the house.” Mr. Suh recalled Mr. Cassidy once lashing out at him when Mr. Suh turned his car around in Mr. Cassidy’s driveway. “He yelled, ‘Do not come onto my driveway.’” Family court records show that Mr. Cassidy was married for 10 years before divorcing in 2004. The couple had no children. In 2009, Mr. Cassidy sought a restraining order against his former girlfriend, Jingkun Wang, known as Connie. In court filings, he accused her of vandalizing his roommate’s car, calling at late hours of the night, hurling insults and suggesting she had him under surveillance. Ms. Wang countered that Mr. Cassidy, whom she had dated for a year, had “major mood swings due to bipolar disorder” which were exacerbated when he consumed large quantities of alcohol. She also accused him of forcing himself on her sexually. Their relationship failed when he told her around February 2009 that a female houseguest had moved in, and that she should no longer come visit. She denied vandalizing any vehicles, and accused him of stealing items from restaurants and employers, and failing to return her television and computer printer. “He has manipulated me in many ways which are apparent to my friends and family,” she said. The court ordered Ms. Wang to stay at least 300 yards from him, his parents and his new girlfriend for three years. In a phone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Wang, now 58, said she had not spoken to Mr. Cassidy in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable,” who would be loving one moment and mean the next. She also described his drinking as excessive. They met on Match.com, Ms. Wang said. Two months into their relationship, he told her to pick a diamond ring and he would buy it, she recalled. She declined. After they broke up, Mr. Cassidy showed up at her apartment complex one day, Ms. Wang said. A neighbor let him in and he took her brand-new Toyota Camry, for which he had a key, without permission. He returned it damaged from what he told her was an accident, she said. — Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Thomas Fuller Andy and Alice Abad were in their kitchen Wednesday morning in southeastern San Jose when they saw a funnel of smoke pouring out of a neighbor’s home, a one-story gray house with white trim and a patchy lawn. Mr. Abad called 911 and was told that firefighters were already on the way. “The flames were above the rooftop,” Mr. Abad said. He took a picture of the house with his cellphone and headed out with his wife to a doctor’s appointment. When he returned home at noon, the neighborhood was swarming with fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. “What’s going on here?” Mr. Abad said as he stepped out of his car in his driveway. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, described a “strange connection” between the fire in the house and the attack on a rail yard near downtown that left nine people dead, including the gunman. The site of the shooting is eight miles away from the home, a 10- or 15-minute drive. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights of emergency vehicles that penetrated into the cul-de-sacs of what is described by residents as a quiet suburban neighborhood populated largely by Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. (The neighborhood is near Evergreen, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Members of the bomb squad walked past citrus and palm trees to enter the home as other law enforcement officers carried shovels and other garden implements into the property. The home on Wednesday afternoon was largely intact, but the crown of the roof was darkened by fire. — Thomas Fuller Families of Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority employees were directed to wait for news at a county building close to the rail yard. Jazmin Diaz arrived to find out if her brother, Max, who works for the authority, was OK. He doesn’t work at the part of the rail yard where the shooting occurred, she said, but had not answered his phone all morning. “I hope he’s good,” she said, pausing to take a phone call from a family member. “We believe that God protected him.” One man, who would not provide his name, arrived at the county building with his grandfather. He was hoping for news of his uncle, a light rail operator who he has not heard from all morning. “I never thought something like this would really happen,” the man said, before entering the building. “He has two little kids — that’s all I can think about right now.” Brandi Childress, a spokeswoman for the V.T.A., said she was informed at 6:45 a.m. local time that there was an “active shooter event.” Employees were on the job at that time, she said. “It is where we have dispatchers and maintenance,” she said. “They get up early and they are there. That is why the focus is on containing and evacuating employees. It is where we store and maintain all of our trains.” At about 1 p.m., at least 10 family groups emerged from the side of the county building, where Gov. Gavin Newsom of California stood in the doorway. Some, including a pair of women with their arms wrapped around a third woman, were escorted by security officers into a waiting bus. Loirena Ruico, who drove the bus to the nearby American Red Cross building, said the ride was somber. “It’s scary, it’s so tense — everyone’s crying,” she said. Outside the Red Cross center, Christina Gonzalez choked back tears as she waited for news of her cousin Michael Rudometkin. She said she left work and rushed to the center after her brother told her that Mr. Rudometkin was among the people who were shot. She said she had yet to learn anything about her cousin’s condition or where he was. “I’m just waiting and praying, and hoping he’s OK,” Ms. Gonzalez said. She said Mr. Rudometkin, who lives in Santa Cruz, was at a union meeting in the morning. “Very proud, loved his job and just always stood up for everyone’s rights,” she said of her cousin. “He is just a very good person, so we’re really hoping this isn’t the place to tell us the bad news.” By Wednesday evening, the county medical examiner’s office had released the names of the victims, including Mr. Rudometkin, 40. — Kellen Browning As dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail yard were preparing for the start of the day’s service, gunshots threw the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose into turmoil. Glenn Hendricks, the authority chairman, called the incident “a horrible tragedy” for its work force of some 2,100 mostly unionized employees, who provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice quaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” Transit service continued for several hours after the shooting without disruption, even as the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office — which is headquartered next door to the rail yard as part of a sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose — dispatched deputies to the scene of the shooting in a maintenance yard. “As I drove here,” Mr. Hendricks said, citing the dedication of the authority employees, “I saw buses on the road.” But service on the light-rail system’s three lines was later shut down as the maintenance facility became the scene of an active investigation. Mr. Hendricks said extra buses would be dispatched to cover for the canceled trains. He added that grief counseling would be made available to workers, including the 100 or so who were on the scene when the shooting erupted. Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said several of the people who were killed were V.T.A. employees, as was the gunman. “This is a horrific day for our city,” said the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, who also serves on the V.T.A. board. “And a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” — Shawn Hubler The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-26 16:17:55,‘The flames were above the rooftop’: A home connected to the gunman catches fire.,,1,http://nytimes.com
106,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/editorial-san-jose-mass-shooting-demands-action-on-gun-control/,"Trending: The United States has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate of any of the world’s most developed nations. The mass shooting Wednesday morning that killed nine people and injured others at the Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard in San Jose follows 12 mass shootings across the United States last weekend. All told, as of Wednesday, according to the Gun Control Archive, there have been 231 mass shootings in the United States in the first 146 days of 2021, killing 260 people and injuring 864. That’s unacceptable. Two hundred and thirty one mass shootings this year. Twelve mass shootings in a single weekend. In a nation where a 2020 Gallup Poll showed that 96% of Americans favored universal background checks on gun purchases. Bay Area residents and Americans across the nation must demand that Congress take action on meaningful gun control legislation. Even as the tragedy in San Jose was unfolding, the Senate Judiciary Committee was holding a confirmation hearing for David Chipman, President Biden’s choice to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Chipman, a two-decade veteran of the ATF, was picked by Biden to give life to the gun control effort. The ATF is the main agency that enforces federal gun laws, but it hasn’t had a confirmed director since 2015. The ATF has had only one director since Congress approved the position in 2006, primarily because of strong opposition from the National Rifle Association. Chipman has been an outspoken advocate for gun-violence prevention, including an assault-style weapons ban. The hope is that if he is confirmed, his presence will help Congress see the light on sensible gun control laws. The Senate is expected to take up legislation that would close the loopholes on background checks for sales of firearms or requiring waiting periods before purchases to prevent impulsive violence. The House has already passed two bills that would accomplish those goals. In 1994, Congress passed the Brady Background Check System, which is credited with preventing an estimated 4 million prohibited gun transactions. But the legislation did not require background checks on gun purchases by private parties, including sales made online or at gun shows, where about 20% of gun sales occur. It also included a provision that allowed gun purchases to go through if the background check process was not completed within three days. That’s the loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to buy a gun he was barred from owning — the same gun he used in 2015 to kill nine Black people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. It was not known as of Wednesday afternoon what weapon the San Jose shooter used or whether it was legally purchased. Regardless, the background check legislation needs to be approved and sent to the president for his signature. That will require a minimum of 10 Republicans to overcome an expected filibuster in the Senate. The legislation deserves widespread GOP support. The Gallup Poll revealed that 84% of Republicans support background checks for gun sales at gun shows and online purchases. And 69% of NRA members back the expanded background checks for firearms sales. Given that level of support, Congress should find the courage to end the political stalemate on background checks and help keep guns out of the hands of people who have no business possessing a firearm.

President Joe Biden wants a report on COVID-19's origins on his desk in 90 days. And if you didn't catch the supermoon eclipse situation, we've got pictures. 👋 Hiya! It's Laura. Happy Wednesday! I've got super(moon) news for you. But first, it's a baby boom! Did you know Tasmanian devils are marsupials? They have a pouch!

The Short List is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe to the newsletter here or text messages here. A light rail yard in San Jose, California, was the scene of a deadly shooting Wednesday morning, when a gunman opened fire, killing at least eight people in the latest shooting rampage to rock the nation in recent weeks. Police spokesman Russell Davis said the gunman, an employee at the sprawling Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail hub, was also dead, and that other employees were among the victims, adding that, ""there are multiple injuries and multiple fatalities."" Mayor Sam Liccardo said the city was facing a ""dark moment."" Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said bomb dogs alerted officers to the presence of explosives on the scene. A bomb squad had cordoned off the area, she said. Nationwide, there have been at least 230 mass shootings in 2021. A mass shooting is defined as four or more shot or killed, not including the shooter, according to the Gun Violence Archive. President Joe Biden wants to know, and he's pressing the intelligence community for better answers. As questions grow about whether the virus was the result of an accident in a Chinese laboratory or spread through other means, Biden said Wednesday that he wants the community, which has been divided over the issue, to ""redouble"" their investigative efforts, and report within 90 days on the likely origins of COVID-19. As of today, the U.S. Intelligence Community has “coalesced around two likely scenarios,” according to Biden's statement. While two elements of the community lean toward the likelihood that the virus emerged from human contact with an infected animal, one leans toward the possibility of a laboratory accident. Did you catch the moon show? One of the greatest sky spectacles of the year happened Wednesday morning as a full moon, supermoon and lunar eclipse happened at the same time, creating the super flower blood moon. While the biggest, brightest supermoon of the year will illuminate the sky Wednesday, the total eclipse was visible for only about 15 minutes, and only in some western parts of the U.S., where watchers were able to see the full moon turn to a rusty red as it dipped into Earth's shadow. If you missed this one, don't worry: The country and Canada will get to witness a 99% lunar eclipse high on the horizon with little obstruction on Nov. 19, according to experts. In a bizarre case involving ""doomsday"" religious beliefs, the mother of two missing children in Idaho, who were found dead last year, and her husband appeared briefly in court Wednesday via Zoom after they were charged with murder in the children's deaths. New charges were filed against Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell, her husband, who is also facing murder charges in connection with the children's death and his former wife's death, marking the most serious ramping up of the criminal case against the couple. Joshua ""JJ"" Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, vanished in late 2019 in a case that drew national attention as details emerged of multiple suspicious deaths, ""doomsday"" religious beliefs and the Daybells fleeing to Hawaii. New court documents lay out the sequence of events that led to the children's deaths and, for the first time, adds charges in connection with the death of Tammy Daybell, Chad's former wife. The couple could face life in prison or the death penalty if convicted, prosecutors said. How's this for a movie blockbuster: Amazon has confirmed it will acquire movie studio MGM in a deal worth $8.45 billion. In a statement Wednesday, Amazon said it would help preserve MGM's heritage of films, which includes 4,000 titles, including the James Bond franchise, ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky."" MGM also owns several popular TV series, including ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" which is in the midst of its fourth season on Hulu. ""The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP (intellectual property) in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team,"" said Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, in a statement. Amazon's acquisition of MGM highlights a shift to consolidation in a competitive market for streaming services.

109,https://www.rawstory.com/california-governor-unleashes-mass-shootings/,"Now that the lockdowns have been eased, more people in public means more and larger mass shootings. Such was the case in San Jose on Wednesday when eight people were shot after an employee opened fire at a light-rail facility. Speaking at a briefing with local police and sheriff's deputies, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) was empathetic and thanked police for their hard work, but then he took a turn. ""There's a numbness I imagine some feel act this because there's a sameness to this. You know?"" he began. ""Anywhere USA. Feels like this happens over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Wasn't that long ago I was out here talking about the tragic loss of two children, one in a mother's arms, at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Just here in this community. Down in southern California, San Bernardino, a few years prior, Santa Barbara. You know? Pick a state. And here we are. In the United States of America. We're experiencing something not experienced anywhere else in the world."" ""There's a sameness to this and that numbness I think is something we're all feeling today looking at this scene, listening to governors, mayors, chiefs speaking similar tone and terms. Expression of condolences,"" he continued. ""All the right emotions and perhaps the right words but begged the damn question — what the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us? When will we put down the arms figure figuratively and the hand wringing that produces nothing but more scenes like this repeated over and over and over again. I say that not as a governor but as a father of four and a member of this community that cares deeply about it."" MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace called it a ""Bulworth"" moment, referring to the 1998 film where a politician starts saying whatever he wants because he thinks he's going to be assassinated.

www.youtube.com ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

113,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/biden-pick-atf-pushes-back-against-gop-senators-disinformation-n1268677," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News President Joe Biden's choice to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, David Chipman, got a rough welcome Wednesday from Senate Republicans at a confirmation hearing, where he defended his statements about guns and pushed back against a social media disinformation campaign. ""Buckle your seat belt. You want to be the head of the ATF. Hang on tight. They're coming after you, buddy,"" Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told Chipman at the beginning of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. ""It's going to be rough at times."" Leadership of the ATF, which enforces gun laws, has become a political hot potato — the Senate has managed to confirm only one director in the last 15 years, who served in the Obama administration. Chipman spent more than two decades with the ATF before he went to work with Giffords, a group that advocates for stricter gun laws, which is named for its founder, Gabby Giffords, a former lawmaker who was shot at a constituent event. Chipman pushed back against a right-wing social media campaign that accused him of having participated in the deadly ATF raid on a cult compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993. The disinformation campaign included a picture, supposedly of Chipman, posing with a gun in front of the smoldering rubble of the Branch Davidian compound. ""This is not me,"" Chipman said, adding that whoever the person in the picture is, ""it's not an ATF agent."" Chipman said he was sent to Waco in May 1993 — a month after the end of the deadly siege — to join the investigation into what went wrong. ""One of the reasons I was selected is because I had no involvement in the actual case that was being examined,"" Chipman said. As he was testifying, reports started coming in of a mass shooting at a rail yard in San Jose, California. At least eight people were killed. ""I'm sorry to hear that news. I wasn't aware of that. If I'm confirmed as ATF director, one of our priorities at ATF will be focusing on gun trafficking, the unlawful transfer of legal guns to criminals, and perhaps in this case, a crime like this could be prevented,"" Chipman said. Republicans focused on Chipman's work on gun control, suggesting that it was disqualifying. ""Many see putting a committed gun control proponent like David Chipman in charge of ATF is like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services or antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department,"" said the committee's ranking member, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pressed Chipman about comments he had made opposing legislation that would loosen regulations for silencers for firearms, which Lee sponsored. ""You said, 'The only people that benefit from this bill are gun lobbyists and criminals,'"" Lee recounted. ""There are legitimate reasons someone might want to protect their hearing,"" he said. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, focused on Chapman's remarks supporting a ban on AR-15s, which Biden has also called for. ""The AR-15 is one of, if not the, most popular rifles in America,"" Cruz said. ""Your public position is you want to ban AR-15s, is that correct?"" ""I support a ban,"" Chipman said, but ""if I'm confirmed, I would simply enforce the laws on the books right now. There is no such ban on those guns."" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., made it clear after the hearing that he would oppose Chipman's nomination, referring to him as ""Joe Biden's gun-grabbing nominee for the ATF."" ""This is the last person who should be given any power,"" Cotton tweeted. The Senate is split 50-50 between the two parties. Democrats could confirm Chipman without any Republican support if they remain united, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting a tiebreaking vote.

Biden’s pick to lead A.T.F. faces fierce opposition at his confirmation hearing. President Biden calls for U.S. intelligence agencies to investigate the origins of the virus. Biden is said to be planning to nominate Burns and Garcetti for ambassadorships. A filibuster fight is looming in the Senate. The mother of a Capitol Police officer who died lobbies G.O.P. to drop their opposition to an inquiry. Karine Jean-Pierre takes her turn at the White House podium. Biden’s ties to Israel face a stiff test as Iran talks loom. transcript “The leadership positions I held at A.T.F. grounded me in what it will take to improve bureau operations and morale. I’ve supervised agents in the field multiple times. I use that experience to develop new approaches to combat homicides committed with firearms impacting communities across the United States. While at A.T.F. headquarters during the Bush administration, I was responsible for all A.T.F. field policies and procedures. I later oversaw all firearms programs and foreign offices for the entire bureau. These experiences, hard won over the course of decades, will serve as my guide if I’m confirmed to lead the A.T.F. The bureau has excelled at investigating crimes since the days of Eliot Ness. My leadership mission will be to sharpen A.T.F.’s focus while striving to prevent more violent crimes from occurring in the first place.” “The AR-15 is one of, if not the most popular rifle in America. It’s not a machine gun, it’s a rifle. Your public position is that you want to ban AR-15s, is that correct?” “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president. The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on A.T.F. SWAT team. And it’s a particularly lethal weapon, and regulating it as other particularly lethal weapons, I have advocated for. As A.T.F. director, if I’m confirmed, I would simply enforce the laws on the books. And right now, there is no such ban on those guns.” David Chipman, President Biden’s pick to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, faced withering Republican criticism during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday over his history of scathing comments about gun ownership. Mr. Chipman, a two-decade veteran of the A.T.F. who has advised gun control groups, was chosen in part because of his willingness to bluntly confront an industry that has handcuffed the agency, which enforces gun laws. But his comments — including an interview last year in which he jokingly likened the frenzied buying of guns during the coronavirus pandemic to a zombie apocalypse — were the subject of repeated questions by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Many see putting a committed gun control proponent like David Chipman in charge of A.T.F. is like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, or antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the ranking member of the committee. As the hearing got underway, news alerts of a fatal shooting in San Jose, Calif., began pinging on lawmakers’ phones. “It is not lost on me that there is another mass shooting,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. The National Rifle Association has mounted a coordinated campaign against Mr. Chipman’s nomination, citing his promises to regulate semiautomatic weapons and his support of universal background checks. The organization has effectively exercised veto power over the appointment of stable leadership at the A.T.F., blocking several potential directors, including a conservative police union official tapped by President Donald J. Trump. The gun lobby has also led a decades-long campaign to hobble the A.T.F. by fighting funding increases and efforts to modernize its paper-based system of tracking firearms. Republicans said Mr. Chipman’s penchant for provocation made him an unacceptable choice, hoping to scuttle his nomination just as a history of inflammatory Twitter posts doomed the nomination of Neera Tanden, Mr. Biden’s first choice to run his budget office. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, grilled Mr. Chipman for saying in jest in an interview last year that some first-time gun buyers were preparing “for end times scenarios and zombie apocalypses.” Mr. Chipman, who appeared to try to avoid a back-and-forth with Republicans, said those remarks had been “self-deprecating.” He also deflected questions about his advocacy of progressive policy by saying that he viewed himself as “a cop.” A few minutes later, after Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, criticized him for calling for restrictions on AR-15-style rifles, Mr. Chipman thanked the senator for “offering me a Dr Pepper” during a private meeting the day before. Mr. Biden chose Mr. Chipman after a lobbying campaign by gun safety organizations, led by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords. In recent years, Mr. Chipman has worked with groups run by Ms. Giffords and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, who also pressed for his selection. The White House was initially reluctant to nominate someone who would provoke such intense opposition, but Mr. Biden decided that he needed to take a chance after the mass killings in Atlanta and Boulder, White House officials said. White House officials believe that Mr. Chipman has just enough votes — 50 to 52, by their estimate — to overcome near-unanimous opposition by Republicans. Two critical Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have told Democratic leaders that they are likely to vote for him, provided the hearings go well. Two Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, have not ruled out supporting him. — Glenn Thrush transcript Today, the president asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to him in 90 days. Back in early 2020, the president called for the C.D.C. to get access to China to learn about the virus so we could fight it more effectively. Getting to the bottom of the origin of this pandemic will help us understand how to prepare for the next pandemic, and the next one. As we have done throughout our Covid response, we have been committed to a whole of government effort to ensure we’re doing everything to both understand and end this pandemic, and to prevent future pandemics. This is why the president is asking the U.S. intelligence community, in cooperation with other elements of our government, to redouble efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring the world closer to a definitive conclusion on the origin of the virus and deliver a report to him again in 90 days. And we will continue to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation with the needed access to get to the bottom of a virus that’s taken more than three million lives across the globe. President Biden ordered U.S. intelligence agencies on Wednesday to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, indicating that his administration takes seriously the possibility that the deadly virus was accidentally leaked from a lab, in addition to the prevailing theory that it was transmitted by an animal to humans outside a lab. In a statement, Mr. Biden made it clear that the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies had not yet reached a consensus on how the virus, which prompted a pandemic and has killed almost 600,000 Americans, originated in China. He directed them to report back to him in 90 days. “I have now asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion,” the president said. Mr. Biden’s statement, his most public and expansive yet on the question of how the virus spread to humans, came as top health officials renewed their appeals this week for a more rigorous inquiry. And it followed mounting criticism of a report from an international team of experts convened by the World Health Organization that largely dismissed the possibility that the virus had accidentally escaped from a Chinese laboratory called the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Deep uncertainty remains about the origins of a virus that spread to every part of the globe over 17 months. The assessments of scientists are largely unchanged: Many believe that a so-called natural spillover from animal to human remains the most plausible explanation. While U.S. intelligence agencies have collected some new evidence, the additional information is not enough to allow them to draw definitive conclusions about long-simmering theories regarding the lab in the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak. But the president’s carefully worded directive underscored a new surge in interest about the lab, which President Donald J. Trump and some of his top aides repeatedly blamed for the pandemic. Some scientists attributed the renewed focus on the lab to Mr. Trump’s departure from the White House — and being less identified with the theory — while others said it reflected the deep frustrations with the recent W.H.O. report that was co-written by Chinese scientists. — Michael D. Shear, Julian E. Barnes, Carl Zimmer and Benjamin Mueller President Biden plans to announce that he has selected R. Nicholas Burns, a veteran Foreign Service officer and a former ambassador to NATO, as his ambassador to China, and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles as his ambassador to India, according to two people familiar with the process. Mr. Biden has also selected Thomas R. Nides, a vice chairman at Morgan Stanley who served as a deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama, to serve as the ambassador to Israel, those people said. Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, who developed a close relationship with Mr. Biden when he was vice president, has been selected to serve as ambassador to Japan, the people said. And Ken Salazar, a former senator from Colorado and the interior secretary in the Obama administration, is said to have been chosen as the ambassador to Mexico. Mr. Biden has been reviewing lists of names for some of the crucial jobs for months and was deeply interested and involved in the selection process, administration officials said. And many of the nominees for coveted ambassadorships were offered the positions weeks or months ago. But the administration has delayed announcing the picks for several reasons. Instead of revealing the names one at a time, officials are planning to unveil a diverse slate of nominees, people involved in the process said. The administration is hoping to go beyond racial and gender diversity and focus on signaling to career Foreign Service officials that they are valued by whittling down the number of posts given to campaign donors. Another cause for delay is that many of the people who were selected are still completing time-consuming background checks and financial reviews as part of the rigorous vetting process. The Biden administration had initially hoped to move its first slate of nominees by mid-April, an official said. A White House official on Wednesday declined to comment on the timing and said that none of the names were final until the administration made an official announcement. Others in the running for key positions include Cindy McCain — the widow of Senator John McCain of Arizona — who is said to be Mr. Biden’s pick to serve as ambassador to the U.N. World Food Program, and Mark Gitenstein, a former ambassador to Romania and a close friend of Mr. Biden’s, who is said to be in consideration for ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Biden is also considering nominating Mark Brzezinski, who served as ambassador to Sweden during the Obama administration, as his ambassador to Poland, according to people familiar with the process. Mr. Brzezinski is the brother of Mika Brzezinski, a host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” and the son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter. — Annie Karni With a showdown coming over the creation of an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol assault, Democrats are bumping up against the limits of what they can accomplish in the evenly divided Senate without changes to the filibuster rules. Republicans who see the commission as a threat to their midterm election hopes are poised to use the filibuster to block the inquiry as early as Thursday, underscoring the power of a Senate minority determined to kill legislation even if it is popular and has bipartisan support. It is the sort of clash lawmakers have been anticipating since January, when it was clear that it would be nearly impossible for Democrats to enact President Biden’s agenda unless they could do away with the 60-vote threshold for advancing legislation over the objections of any senator. With Memorial Day looming as an informal deadline for legislative progress, Senate Democrats have made no move to take up a sweeping voting rights bill, gun safety legislation, expansions of labor and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, a measure to overhaul policing, or legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants. Those bills have all passed the Democratic-led House. Activists want to see action on them soon, before what could be a short window of Democratic control of Congress and the White House comes to an end. “The next two months are going to be absolutely critical,” said Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for the anti-filibuster group Fix Our Senate. “We are going to find out whether Democrats are going to defend the filibuster or take the steps to defend our democracy.” — Carl Hulse The mother of a Capitol Police officer who died after clashing with pro-Trump rioters on Jan. 6 lobbied Republican senators on Wednesday to drop their opposition to creating an independent commission to investigate the violent attack, warning that blocking the inquiry would be a “slap in the faces” of officers. In an unsparing statement, Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Officer Brian D. Sicknick, said her son and his fellow officers had paid a steep price defending the Capitol from “animals” targeting Congress and deserved a thorough accounting of what had happened. She planned to press her case face-to-face on Thursday, requesting meetings with every Republican senator before the vote, when they were expected to kill the commission. “I suggest that all congressmen and senators who are against this bill visit my son’s grave in Arlington National Cemetery and, while there, think about what their hurtful decisions will do to those officers who will be there for them going forward,” Ms. Sicknick said in the statement. “Putting politics aside, wouldn’t they want to know the truth of what happened on Jan. 6?” she said. “If not, they do not deserve to have the jobs they were elected to do.” The House approved the 10-person commission last week, with 35 Republicans joining Democrats in support. A handful of Republican senators — including Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — have indicated that they will also vote yes when Democrats put bipartisan legislation creating the commission on the floor as early as Thursday. One or two others could join them, depending on the fate of changes Ms. Collins has proposed. But Republican leaders are preparing to filibuster the legislation, fearing that a detailed investigation into an attack spurred on by President Donald J. Trump’s lies of a stolen election would churn up damaging revelations that could hurt their party politically. The last-minute lobbying by Ms. Sicknick recalled an intensive push by families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to resurrect a bill to create what became the 9/11 Commission after an initial version failed in the House. Their advocacy was seen as instrumental in the eventual creation of that inquiry, which is the model for the investigation that is now under consideration. Though it appeared unlikely to succeed, Ms. Sicknick’s efforts drew the attention of at least one prominent Republican, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Ms. Cheney voted in favor of the commission in the House days after Republicans ousted her from party leadership because she insisted on calling out Mr. Trump for his false claims that inspired the riot. “#ImwithGladys,” Ms. Cheney wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. The medical examiner in Washington concluded that Officer Sicknick, 42, suffered multiple strokes in the hours after clashing with the rioters and died of natural causes. The Justice Department has charged two men with assault for spraying him with an unknown chemical. About 140 officers were injured that day, and two officers responding to the Capitol assault later died by suicide. — Nicholas Fandos Karine Jean-Pierre, the principal deputy press secretary for the White House, held a televised briefing for the first time on Wednesday, a baptism-by-fire moment that came shortly after a mass shooting and a request from President Biden that U.S. intelligence officials delve deeper into the origins of the coronavirus. In her first outing, Ms. Jean-Pierre was immediately pushed for specifics about why Mr. Biden had ordered a 90-day review of the latest analysis on the virus, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident. She offered none. “Right now we’re just going to focus on the president’s announcement on the 90-day investigation,” Ms. Jean-Pierre said when asked what would happen if Chinese officials refused to cooperate with investigations. “We will have more to share after the 90 days,” she said when asked whether the results of the investigation would be made public. Ms. Jean-Pierre showed little interest in getting ahead of the president or the administration, a tactic that is frustrating to reporters but drew praise from members of the administration, including Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff. “History made (and a job well done),” he wrote on Twitter. Ms. Jean-Pierre was the first Black woman in decades to address journalists on behalf of the president in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. (Judy Smith, a deputy press secretary for President George H.W. Bush, was the first Black spokeswoman to do so in 1991.) Her appearance at the podium on Wednesday was seen both internally and externally as an audition for the White House press secretary job. Jen Psaki, the current press secretary, recently said that she intended to leave the post after about a year. A former State Department spokeswoman, Ms. Psaki came to the job more battle-tested — and more familiar to the Washington press corps — than Ms. Jean-Pierre, who has worked on Democratic campaigns and as the chief public affairs officer at the liberal group MoveOn. Ms. Jean-Pierre, 43, is not the heir apparent to replace Ms. Psaki; other names put forth include Symone D. Sanders, the vice president’s press secretary, and Ned Price, the State Department spokesman. But Ms. Jean-Pierre has had frequent contact with the White House press corps in recent months. To get better acclimated to a White House where top officials tend to obsess over discipline in messaging, Ms. Jean-Pierre has delivered occasional news briefings aboard Air Force One, which is lower stakes than live television. She is almost always in the room when Ms. Psaki holds briefings, which has allowed her to familiarize herself with reporters. And the two are friendly: Before the door to the briefing room opens, they often do a dance to shake off their nerves, Ms. Psaki said in an interview with The Times in January. Ms. Jean-Pierre has made missteps along the way. When the White House rushed to publish an edited transcript this month, she mistakenly told reporters aboard Air Force One that the administration supported Ukraine’s interest in joining NATO. But at other times, she has impressed members of Mr. Biden’s inner circle, including when she kept cool while speaking to reporters minutes after the president tripped twice while boarding his plane. “It’s very windy,” she told reporters. “I almost fell coming up the steps myself.” Ms. Jean-Pierre was asked on Wednesday what it meant to her to be the second Black woman in decades to deliver a formal briefing. “It’s a real honor to be standing here today. I appreciate the historic nature, I really do,” she said. “But I believe that being behind this podium, being in this room, being in this building, is not about one person. It’s about what we do on behalf of the American people.” — Katie Rogers Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel took a moment on Tuesday to thank the Biden administration for its support during his country’s 11-day conflict with Hamas in Gaza — and then abruptly changed the subject, and his tone. “We discussed many regional issues, but none is greater than Iran,” Mr. Netanyahu said, standing with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken after their meeting in Jerusalem. He pointedly added that he hoped the United States would not rejoin the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, “because we believe that that deal paves the way for Iran to have an arsenal of nuclear weapons with international legitimacy.” The Israeli leader’s remarks lent a sour note to his welcome of Mr. Blinken. And it undoubtedly echoed in Vienna, where a fifth round of negotiations aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the nuclear agreement, a top priority of President Biden’s, opened on Tuesday. The Gaza conflict appears to have earned Mr. Biden good will with Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli public. But the prospect of a U.S. return to the nuclear deal threatens to generate new strains between Washington and Jerusalem on a subject that poisoned relations between President Barack Obama and Mr. Netanyahu. “The big drama looms, and that is the Iran nuclear deal,” said Jonathan Schanzer, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “I think both Biden and Netanyahu realize that whatever discomfort both sides may have felt throughout this current conflict, it is small fries compared to the political friction that is looming.” Compounding the trouble is the conflict in Gaza, which has created anger in Israel and among Republicans in Congress over Iran’s ties to Palestinian militants. Most analysts say Iran played no active role in this month’s rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza, even though Tehran openly cheered them on. — Michael Crowley transcript “The purpose of today’s hearing is to show Americans their government is finally looking out for them, that we understand this economic system has betrayed millions of workers, that it holds our country back. Here’s what we want to hear from you today. What are you and the companies you run going to do, not just say, but actually do to change? We want to hear what concrete actions you’ll take to change the incentives on Wall Street to reward work instead of just rewarding wealth, to pay for and work to undo the damage that Wall Street has done and continues to do to communities of color.” “But I am concerned about increasing pressure on banks to embrace ‘wokeism’ and appease the far-left’s attacks on capitalism. And I worry that continuing down this path could lead to distorted credit allocation, activists seeking to make political change through the financial system instead of through the democratic process.” “The origins of this global crisis, unlike the last one, this is a public health crisis with severe economic consequences. And through this pandemic, Citi has shown we’re a very different bank than the one that entered the financial crisis more than a decade ago. We’re smaller, we’re safer, we’re stronger and we’re far less complex. And we have had the financial resources to support our clients and communities through this crisis.” “We’re able to help our clients and ultimately, the U.S. economy through the worst economic shock in recent history, while at the same time increasing investments in support of our teammates and our communities. For our clients, that included financial assistance for our business-as-usual work, and also helping to deliver the timely federal relief programs. We at Bank of America believe in capitalism, and it’s the best way to solve the challenges that are facing society. We operate by delivering great returns for our shareholders and delivering for society. We call that responsible growth.” The chief executives of the six biggest American lenders testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday, the first time the committee has summoned all the top bankers since the financial crisis of 2008. (They will also appear at the House Committee on Financial Services on Thursday, for the first time since 2019.) At the Senate hearing, Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and the committee’s chairman, pressed the bank chiefs on a range of subjects, sending them a list of questions on topics including the riskiness of their assets, the diversity of their work forces, actions on climate change, pledges on racial equity and more. It made for a disjointed hearing as senators veered from issue to issue, trying to catch the chief executives off guard or unprepared. Their prepared testimonies addressed the committee’s questions in varying depth and detail, while all making the case that their institutions had become healthier, safer and more law-abiding since 2008. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase turned in a nine-page paper urging business, government and society to address inequities and “unleash the extraordinary vibrancy of the American economy.” Jane Fraser of Citigroup prepared 11 pages (and a three-page addendum with data and tables) that noted her bank’s approach to cryptocurrencies, saying that it was “focusing resources and efforts to understand changes in the digital asset space.” James Gorman of Morgan Stanley assembled a 20-page report with few frills that included a short introduction and responses to each question in order. Charles Scharf of Wells Fargo and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs each submitted 15 pages heavy on environmental, social and governance issues. Brian Moynihan of Bank of America had the most to say, with 32 pages that devoted a lot of space to the bank’s “responsible growth” principles. “We embrace our dual responsibility to drive both profits and purpose,” he wrote. — Ephrat Livni Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the genteel former Navy secretary who shed the image of a dilettante to become a leading Republican voice on military policy during 30 years in the Senate, died on Tuesday night. He was 94. He died at his home of heart failure, according to a former staff member. Mr. Warner may have for a time been best known nationally as the dashing sixth husband of the actress Elizabeth Taylor. Her celebrity was a draw on the campaign trail during his difficult first race for the Senate in 1978, an election he won narrowly to start his political career. The couple divorced in 1982. In the latter stages of his congressional service, Mr. Warner was also recognized as a protector of the Senate’s traditions and was credited with trying to forge bipartisan consensus on knotty issues such as the Iraq war, judicial nominations and treatment of terror suspects. In retrospect, the senatorial Mr. Warner — with his shock of white hair, immaculate attire and unflagging politeness — represented a vanishing breed in his party, and particularly in his home state, which has become increasingly polarized since his retirement in 2009. He was a crossover candidate in a state where politicians in both parties had long gravitated to the center, offsetting the loss of conservative voters over the years with support from Democrats and independents. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden reflected on his time serving with Mr. Warner in the Senate. “I always knew that John’s decisions were guided by his values — even when we disagreed on the policy outcomes,” the president said. “When told that if he voted in a way that was not in line with his party’s position — as he did numerous times on issues of rational gun policy, women’s rights and judicial nominees — that ‘people would say,’ his favorite rejoinder was, ‘Let ’em say it.’” “Indeed,” Mr. Biden added, “that was his response when, in one of the great honors of my career, he crossed party lines to support me in the 2020 election.” Mr. Warner served in the Navy briefly at the end of World War II. He then joined the Marines to fight in the Korean War, where he served as a ground aircraft maintenance officer, eventually reaching the rank of captain in the reserves. “I’m devastated to hear of the passing of my dear friend John Warner,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia wrote on Twitter early Wednesday. “To me, he was the gold standard in Virginia. I will forever be grateful for his friendship and mentorship. I’ll miss you, John.” The younger Mr. Warner is a Democrat, and is not related to the elder Mr. Warner. But in a parting act of bipartisan comity, the elder Mr. Warner endorsed him when he retired from the Senate after the 2008 election. — Carl Hulse and Glenn Thrush",2021-05-26 17:48:41,The mother of a Capitol Police officer who died lobbies G.O.P. to drop their opposition to an inquiry.,,1,http://nytimes.com

Women leave a gathering area for rail yard workers and family members after a gunman killed eight people at a union meeting.Noah Berger/AP In a press conference responding to the shooting deaths of eight people in a San Jose rail yard this afternoon, California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed his weariness at the frequency of mass shootings, asking, “What the hell is going on in the United States of America?” “There’s a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this, because there’s a sameness to this,” he said. “It just feels like this happens over and over and over again. Rise and repeat, rinse and repeat.” President Biden has ordered the flag to be lowered to half staff for the fifth time since he took office. “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again,” Biden wrote in a statement. “There are children, parents, and spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going to come home. There are union brothers and sisters—good, honest, hardworking people—who are mourning their own.” The San Jose gunman killed eight people before turning the gun on himself. He set his own house on fire before beginning shooting at a Valley Transportation Authority union meeting, authorities said. They believe there are still explosive devices inside the VTA building. “What the hell is wrong with us?” Newsom asked, “And when are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively?” Watch the video below: .@GavinNewsom, on Wednesday's mass shooting in San Jose: ""There's a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this because there's a sameness…It just feels like this happens over and over and over again.

117,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/us/politics/david-chipman-atf.html,"Advertisement Supported by If confirmed, David Chipman would inherit an agency seriously depleted by the National Rifle Association’s campaign to undermine it. By Glenn Thrush President Biden tapped David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in part because the two-decade bureau veteran has few qualms about taking on the gun lobby in blunt, confrontational and unapologetic terms. On Wednesday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee seized on Mr. Chipman’s scathing comments — including an interview in which he likened the frenzied buying of weapons during the pandemic to “zombie apocalypses” — in hopes of sinking his nomination. “Many see that putting a committed gun control proponent, like David Chipman, in charge of A.T.F. is like putting a tobacco executive in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, or antifa in charge of the Portland police department,” Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the panel, said during Mr. Chipman’s confirmation hearing. The selection of Mr. Chipman to lead the federal agency tasked with enforcing the nation’s gun laws and regulations is no run-of-the-mill personnel move, as the amped-up rhetoric of Mr. Grassley and other conservatives vividly illustrated. The bureau has emerged as a cornerstone of the Biden administration’s response to gun violence sweeping the country, an improvised policy increasingly reliant on executive action as Congress debates bills to expand background checks and impose new restrictions on assault rifles. If confirmed, Mr. Chipman would become only the second permanent director of the A.T.F. since the position became subject to Senate confirmation 15 years ago. He would inherit an agency seriously depleted by the National Rifle Association’s campaign to undermine the bureau and hobble its core law enforcement and regulatory functions. News alerts of a shooting in San Jose, Calif., that killed at least eight people began pinging on senators’ phones moments into the hearing, if lawmakers needed any reminder of how high the stakes were. “It is not lost on me that there is another mass shooting,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota. Mr. Chipman spent over 20 years in the A.T.F. as a special agent, serving in the bureau’s Detroit field office and Washington headquarters. Over the last few years, he has worked as a consultant to gun control organizations founded by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York. On Wednesday, Mr. Chipman reiterated his support for universal background checks and restrictions on assault rifles, while pledging to bolster the bureau’s underfunded gun trafficking and inspection units. Republicans, who view an empowered A.T.F. as a threat to the Second Amendment rights of gun owners, countered by portraying Mr. Chipman as a zealot, peppering him with questions about his past statements. Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, grilled Mr. Chipman for saying in jest in an interview last year that some first-time gun buyers were preparing “for end-times scenarios and zombie apocalypses.” Mr. Chipman, who struggled to avoid extended back-and-forth arguments with Republicans, responded by saying that he had been trying to spotlight the unnecessary hoarding of guns and called his remarks “self-deprecating.” He also deflected questions about his progressive policy advocacy — refusing, for instance, to offer a definition for an assault weapon — repeatedly saying he viewed himself as “a cop,” not as a lawyer or a lawmaker. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, questioned Mr. Chipman on whether he would support a ban on AR-15-type weapons, which he said were among the “most popular” guns in the country. “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban,” Mr. Chipman said, adding that Mr. Biden had already expressed support for a Democratic bill to restrict the sales of such guns. The answer did not satisfy Mr. Cruz. But Mr. Chipman tried to defuse the tension by thanking him for “offering me a Dr Pepper” during a meeting in the senator’s office the day before. The N.R.A. has mounted a coordinated campaign to sink Mr. Chipman’s nomination. And over the years, the gun lobby has essentially exercised veto power over the appointment of permanent leadership at the bureau, blocking several would-be directors, including a conservative police union official chosen for the post by President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Biden’s selection of Mr. Chipman came after an intense lobbying campaign by gun safety organizations, led by Ms. Giffords, Mr. Bloomberg and other gun control activists who identified him as their top choice for the job soon after November’s election. The White House was initially reluctant to select a nominee who would provoke such intense opposition, but Mr. Biden decided he needed to make a bold move after the mass killings in the Atlanta area and Boulder this year, White House officials said. The confirmation of Mr. Chipman is not assured. White House officials believe that he has just enough votes — 50 to 52 in their estimate, with Vice President Kamala Harris as a tiebreaker if needed — to overcome near-unanimous opposition by Republicans. It is not even clear if Democrats have the votes necessary to clear him out of the committee without resorting to procedural maneuvers. But two critical Democratic swing votes, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have told Democratic leaders that they are likely to support his nomination, provided the hearings go well. Two Republicans, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, have not ruled out supporting him. If not especially sweet, Mr. Chipman’s hearing on Wednesday was, at least, short. Committee Democrats crammed in his hearing with four other nominees — limiting the amount of time any senator could question Mr. Chipman. The format also forced Republicans to break off attacks if they wanted to query the other nominees, who included Mr. Biden’s picks to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and the criminal division of the Justice Department. As a result, Mr. Chipman spent relatively little time addressing specific steps he might take if confirmed. One exception: He vowed to “get to the bottom” of the significant drop-off in inspections of gun dealers in 2020, which A.T.F. officials have attributed to the difficulties of conducting operations during the pandemic. But the hearing was itself redefined by the same kind of numbing outrage that prodded Mr. Biden to pick Mr. Chipman in the first place, a mass shooting. “If I’m confirmed as A.T.F. director, one of our priorities at A.T.F. will be focusing on gun trafficking, the unlawful transfer of legal guns to criminals, and perhaps in this case a crime like this could be prevented,” Mr. Chipman said when asked to comment on the carnage in San Jose.

Gavin Newsom said that on Wednesday, he spent time and saw firsthand “the pain in those victims"" of the shootings. | Jeff Chiu/AP Photo By CARLA MARINUCCI 05/26/2021 06:15 PM EDT OAKLAND — California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded with frustration and anger Wednesday after a gunman killed eight workers at a San Jose light-rail yard, asking, ""What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us?"" Newsom met Wednesday morning with San Jose officials and labor leaders in the wake of the early morning mass shooting at a Valley Transportation Authority building that was among Northern California's deadliest gun incidents. Authorities said the man killed eight colleagues and injured multiple victims before killing himself.  The governor toggled between honoring law enforcement who responded to the incident, sympathizing with relatives of those killed and expressing outrage that another mass shooting has occurred in the U.S. ""When are we going to come to grips with this?"" he asked. ""When are going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively, our politics, the stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand-wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration, more scenes like this repeated over and and over and over again."" Newsom said that on Wednesday, he spent time and saw firsthand “the pain in those victims"" of the shootings that began at 6:34 a.m. Hours later, some of the family members, he said, are “waiting to hear from the coroner,’’ or get any word “if their mom or dad is still alive.” The Democratic governor has long railed against gun violence and has criticized Republicans and the National Rifle Association in the past for opposing restrictions on weapons. Newsom in 2016 championed a voter-approved ballot initiative, which included a ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines that was blocked last year by a federal appeals court panel. But the full appeals court this year granted that law another review. Shortly after Newsom's comments, President Joe Biden issued a statement expressing sympathy for the ""eight families who will never be whole again."" He listed several other mass shootings that have occurred this year in the U.S. ""Enough,"" he said. ""Once again, I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America."" A database of public mass killings compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University — defining them as four or more dead, not including the shooter— showed no such events happened after March 15 of last year, the AP reported in December. But by early May of this year, the AP reported, there had already been at least 11. Katy Murphy contributed to this report. Carla Marinucci and Jeremy B.

119,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/us/gavin-newsom-san-jose-shooting.html,"Advertisement By Will Wright Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned the “rinse and repeat” cycle of mass shootings in America as he spoke to reporters on Wednesday about the killing of nine people at a rail yard in San Jose. There have been 68 mass shootings in the United States in the past two months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed. “It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Mr. Newsom said. “What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?” Mr. Newsom implored lawmakers to take action, and told all Americans to “take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments but the aftermath of these moments.” The number of mass shootings declined during much of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have become more frequent since March, when a gunman killed eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. Mr. Newsom called mass shootings a “pre-existing condition” that had once again “reared its ugly head.” The shooting in San Jose is believed to be the deadliest in the Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman used three semiautomatic pistols to kill eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco.

120,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/us/san-jose-shooting/the-sikh-community-is-again-bracing-for-heartache-after-a-mass-shooting,"Advertisement By Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin.

Authorities say a Valley Transportation Authority employee killed 8 co-workers before killing himself. Judy Woodruff discusses details of the shooting with the Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna. Judy Woodruff: A rail transit facility that serves Silicon Valley in Northern California is now the scene of the nation's newest mass shooting investigation. Authorities say an employee killed eight co-workers and then killed himself. Around 6: 30 a.m., shots erupted at a rail yard north of downtown San Jose, and sent sheriff's deputies and police scrambling. The attack is the latest in a series of mass shootings this year. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo called it a tragic day. Sam Liccardo: Now is a moment for us to collect ourselves, to understand what happened, to mourn and to help those who have suffered to heal. Judy Woodruff: Police said victims were employees of the Valley Transportation Authority, a public transit system in Santa Clara County. Authorities said the gunman took his own life. He was identified as Sam Cassidy, who also worked at VTA. Police said this morning they were searching the complex for possible explosives. Russel Davis: Right now, public safety is assured at this point. We do have investigators on scene pretty much doing our investigation to see exactly what happened and transpired. Judy Woodruff: Federal law enforcement is assisting with the investigation. Authorities also responded to a fire at Cassidy's house. VTA light rail service was suspended at noon today and replaced with bus service. Glenn Hendricks: It's just very difficult for everyone to be able to try and wrap their heads around and understand what has happened. Judy Woodruff: California Governor Gavin Newsom visited the scene later in the day. Governor Gavin Newsom, D-Calif: To the victims, to those who lost their lives and the families who lost their loved ones, yes, our hearts go out, but we are resolved not to make this meaningless, but to bring meaning to this tragic moment in our state and our nation's history. Judy Woodruff: Authorities have also set up a reunification center for the affected families. Late today, President Biden urged Congress to take action on gun violence. He said — quote — ""Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation."" Congressman Ro Khanna represents part of San Jose. And he joins me now. Representative Khanna, thank you so much for joining us. And of course, our hearts go out to everyone who's lost a family member, a loved one today. What more can you tell us about what happened? Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif: Thank you, Judy. There's just deep hurt in the community, I mean, eight lives senselessly lost, a sense of deep tragedy at the VTA. These are people who go every day to keep the public transportation running. I mean, when people talk about my district, they talk about Apple and Google. They forget that there are a lot of workers who make the infrastructure and transportation work. And they had horrific violence, and there's anger, and there's unanswered questions. Judy Woodruff: And among the unanswered questions, of course, is motive. We know the shooter was an employee, so he presumably knew at least some of the people who are now dead or injured. Do we know any more about that, about the shooter's house being on fire today? Rep. Ro Khanna: Judy, we don't know his motive, but there are reports coming out that he had, reportedly, incidents of domestic violence, that his former girlfriends were concerned that he could pose a threat to others. And I guess the question people are asking is, how does someone like that get access to a gun that literally, in a few seconds, can kill numerous people, change a community's life, change a family's life? It is appalling. And I have been in Congress for five years, and we still have not passed meaningful gun legislation, and people really are frustrated. They want to see action. Judy Woodruff: And, in that vein, Congressman, we looked today, and the Associated Press is reporting that this is the 15th mass killing just this year in 2021; 86 people have died in these mass events, all of them shootings. And this compares to 106 people who died in all of 2020. As you say, it just keeps happening. What are the American people to take away from this? Rep. Ro Khanna: Judy, I'm hopeful that the president can break through. He is someone who has deep empathy. He speaks to the broad range of Americans. He served, as you know, in the Senate for over 30 years. We have passed in the House some very commonsense legislation. It simply says, have a background check. If you're a law-abiding citizen, you can use your guns, but don't put a gun in the hands of someone who has allegedly committed domestic violence. Don't put a gun in the hands of someone who is going to go and kill people at a workplace. I don't understand why this is so complicated; 80 percent of the American people support it. I think what's changed now is, we have a president who is capable of getting the Senate to move, and I really hope that will happen. Judy Woodruff: And what do you know, Congressman, about the gun laws in California that might have made a difference in this incident? Rep. Ro Khanna: Well, Judy, we have some of the strictest gun laws. But I think one of the unanswered questions is, why were the red flag laws not invoked in this case? And we need to get more details. Were the domestic violence charges — did they rise to the level that red flag laws should have been involved? Why was there not more intervention? Why was there not more intervention in terms of mental health counseling and intervention in this person's life, who clearly had issues? I mean, someone doesn't just get up one day and snap and decide to kill dozens of people or try to kill dozens of people. This is something that has been building up. And there was not intervention. And we have to understand why. Judy Woodruff: And we — I heard Governor Gavin Newsom, who was there speaking at the news conference just an hour ago, say, we don't want this event to be just another shooting, and they just keep happening and keep happening. We want it to mean something. But how does that happen? Because these events just keep repeating themselves. Rep. Ro Khanna: Well, I think we have to look at the specifics in this case and then see what California can do. So, are there areas we need to strengthen red flag laws, so that there could have been intervention to take this person's weapon away when there were warning signs? The second thing is, were — is there enough in terms of mental health counseling, and what resources were available to the VTA? And, finally, we need to honor, I think, the families at the VTA and VTA workers. In Silicon Valley, too often, they're invisible. Their contribution isn't recognized. Today, they're really grieving. And it was supposed to be a day of celebration. They finally had rides returning to normal after the pandemic. And now it's one of the worst days in their life. And it's — this is not politics. I have reached out to people. They're shocked. They're devastated. They're never going to forget this. And it's just sad this is happening in workplaces in this country. Judy Woodruff: Terrible and sad. And, as you say, it was supposed to be a very different kind of a day. Congressman Ro Khanna thank you very much again. And, again, our condolences to the entire community. Watch the Full Episode May 26 By Jocelyn Gecker, Martha Mendoza, Associated Press Support Provided By:

125,https://www.rawstory.com/explosives-san-jose-shooting/,"CNN reported Wednesday evening that not only was there a mass shooting that killed eight people, K-9 teams also snuffed out explosives left at the light-rail station. According to reports, the police have sent a robot in to investigate whether it is live and a danger. The gunman shot himself once police arrived on the scene. ""A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks every mass killing over the last 15 years shows that San Jose is the 15th mass killing so far in 2021, all of them shootings. Eighty-six people have died in the shootings, compared with 106 for all of 2020. The database defines mass killings as four or more people dead, not including the shooter, meaning the overall toll of gun violence is much higher when adding in smaller incidents,"" the AP reported.

www.youtube.com ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

127,https://patriotpost.us/articles/80157-they-all-lied-about-covid-19-s-origins-2021-05-26,"Leftists’ hatred of Donald Trump caused them to ignore and deceive about the most important news story since 9/11. For the past year, you’ve been lied to repeatedly about a matter of great consequence: Where did the COVID-19 plague come from? Were its origins natural or man-made? But during the past two weeks, and in particular the past 48 hours, we’ve seen the roof cave in on the Left’s sneering, antiscientific, increasingly improbable Trump-deranged insistence that it occurred naturally — that it came straight from a bat cave. Yet we know the truth: COVID-19, the killer of nearly 3.5 million people worldwide, came from a Chinese lab. Why is this important? First, because learning the truth helps us prevent it from happening again; second, because it exposes the evils of Chinese communism; and third, because it gives the world permission to hold Xi Jinping’s murderous regime accountable. The evidence just keeps piling up. As the Wall Street Journal reports: In April 2012, six miners here fell sick with a mysterious illness after entering [an abandoned copper] mine to clear bat guano. Three of them died. Chinese scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were called in to investigate and, after taking samples from bats in the mine, identified several new coronaviruses. Now, unanswered questions about the miners’ illness, the viruses found at the site and the research done with them have elevated into the mainstream an idea once dismissed as a conspiracy theory: that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, might have leaked from a lab in Wuhan, the city where the first cases were found in December 2019. Indeed, that “conspiracy theory” is fast becoming fact. We most recently covered this just over two weeks ago when we quoted Nicholas Wade, who for 30 years reported on science for the New York Times. As Wade put it, “It’s very hard on the natural emergence scenario to imagine how the virus broke out someplace else, built itself up into a real good human pathogen, and, without infecting anyone else, the guy who was infected jumped on a train to Wuhan, didn’t infect anyone on the train, and it was only when he got to Wuhan that he started spreading. It just doesn’t make a lot of sense.” Others in the scientific community were also taking notice. As the Journal reported on May 13, “In a letter published … in the journal Science, an international group of 18 biologists, immunologists and other scientists criticized the findings of a report released in March by a World Health Organization-led team into the pandemic’s origin and called for a more extensive evaluation of the two leading hypotheses: that the pandemic virus entered the human population and began spreading after escaping from a lab or after jumping to humans from infected animals.” Even the always-wrong and increasingly unpopular Tony Fauci is finally coming around. But the most troubling question is this: What took everyone so long? We already know the answer. Leftists and their media enablers couldn’t bring themselves to admit that then-President Donald Trump might be right. Trump regularly called COVID-19 “the China Virus,” and he said more than a year ago that he had a “high degree of confidence” that COVID-19 came from a Chinese lab. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was also suspicious, and so was brave and lonely Senator Tom Cotton, who was roundly mocked for sharing his spot-on instincts about the ChiComs as early as January 2020. Trump’s certitude on the origins of the virus thus put his haters in a bind. After all, they couldn’t be seen to support him. On anything. Especially not on a matter of substance regarding the most consequential news story since 9/11. And certainly not in an election year. The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman, in fact, blamed Trump for the media’s failure to cover the lab-origin theory. “I do think it’s important to remember that … both [Trump and Pompeo] suggested they had seen evidence that this was formed in a lab … but they refused to release the evidence showing what it was,” Haberman told CNN’s “New Day” on Monday. “And so because of that, that made this instantly political.” Actually, Pompeo launched an investigation to follow the evidence. Team Biden shut it down. Well, before Biden called for another one today. And Haberman and The Paper of Record simply moved along. Nothing to see there. Haberman wasn’t alone, of course. As PJ Media’s Victoria Taft writes, “The self-described ‘fact-checker’ of The Washington Post, Glenn Kessler, admits in a splashy article that because Leftist legacy media reporters (my words, not his) didn’t like President Donald Trump, they ignored his warnings that the ‘China virus’ possibly escaped from a Wuhan, China, lab. They denounced it as a ‘thoroughly debunked theory.’ And they ignored him and his legitimate warnings because they believed the usage of the term was racist.” Clearly, then, these other terms are “racist”: SARS, MERS, West Nile Virus, Ebola, Spanish Flu, Lyme Disease, and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. So, without evidence, the mainstream media slammed the lab-leak theory again and again and again. As for the pathology of this deception, National Review’s Charles C.W. Cooke puts forth a powerful analogy: Of all the grotesque political reactions that follow the news that there has been a mass shooting, perhaps the ugliest comes from those who hope aloud that the crime has been carried out by a certain sort of person. We’ve all seen this phenomenon. First comes the initial report. Next come the initial reactions. And, then, the moment there is space to be filled, certain players within our media ecosystem begin crossing their fingers, bowing their heads in mock prayer, and saying, in effect, “Please let the killer have whatever collection of immutable characteristics and political beliefs is likely to allow me to advance my worldview online.” And the Left, including the “media ecosystem” mentioned by Cooke, subordinated its integrity to its Trump-hating narrative. If Trump espouses X, then we must reflexively and collectively denounce X regardless of the evidence. One need only consider Trump’s support of hydroxychloroquine to see this scenario at work. As our Mark Alexander writes, “Beyond the growing conclusion that the ChiCom Virus pandemic originated in the Wuhan Institute’s P4 lab, the next logical question is this: Did they release the virus intentionally?” Venerable journalist Brit Hume cautiously teased that question this week: “[The Wuhan lab source] becomes undeniable, and more clear than ever, but this is a rogue state. This is an outlaw state. This is not a ‘member of the international community.’ … This is a nation which will suppress the truth, maybe wipe out people in their own ranks who try to tell the truth. … So far as we know the Chinese did not [deliberately release the virus] but it hasn’t been disproven, and given the way China acts, I don’t believe you can completely rule it out.” Again, we — all of us — have been lied to repeatedly. But sunlight is the best disinfectant, and the truth about COVID-19 is finally seeing the light of day. (Updated.)

Gavin Newsom lamented the country's latest mass shooting. ""What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us,"" Newsom said at a press conference, his voice cracking at times. ""When are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively?"" He added, ""Wake up to this reality and take a little damn responsibility, all of us. ... Move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments, but the aftermath of these moments."" There have been 15 mass killings in 2021, each with at least four fatal victims, according to an Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University database. All cases were shootings and claimed a total of 86 lives. The incident marks Santa Clara County's second mass shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people and wounded 17 others before dying by suicide at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in 2019. ""There's a sameness to this — Anywhere U.S.A. It feels like this happens over, and over, and over again, rinse and repeat,"" said Newsom, who is facing a recall and harsh criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It wasn't that long ago, I was standing out here talking about the tragic loss of two children, one in her mother's arms, at the Gilroy Festival."" Prior to the press conference, Newsom spent time with surviving victims and the victims' families at a makeshift reunification center, commending their bravery. ""The fact that they can stand up and support one another is remarkable,"" he said, ""What a human act.""

134,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653337424/0/phoenix/nation~Bidens-nominee-to-lead-ATF-supports-ban-on-AR-rifle/,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Wednesday said he supports a ban of the popular AR-15 rifle. David Chipman, senior policy advisor for anti-gun violence advocacy group Giffords — named for former congresswoman and gun violence survivor/ Gabby Giffords — appeared before a Senate panel Wednesday where he fielded questions from Republican lawmakers. In response to questioning from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tx., Chipman admitted to supporting a ban on the AR-15, perhaps the most popular gun in the country. When asked by Cruz if he wanted to ban the weapon, Chipman said, ""With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president."" The hearing occurred on the same day a Santa Clara Valley railroad employee shot and killed at least eight people before shooting himself at a light rail yard near downtown San Jose, California. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that ""multiple weapons"" were found at the shooting scene. It is not known if an AR-15 was among them. Biden has previously urged Congress to pass legislation that would ban assault weapons and close loopholes in background checks following a mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado grocery store in March. The gunman killed 10 people. The shooting in Boulder was preceded by another mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, which left eight mostly Asian Americans dead. Both assailants used AR-15 style guns; the same weapon used in nearly a dozen mass shootings over the last decade. The president announced Chipman as his nominee for ATF director in April, the same day he introduced six executive actions on curbing gun violence. During the Senate confirmation hearing, Chipman explained his history with the AR-15, which included his government issued weapon while serving on an ATF SWAT team. ""It's a particularly lethal weapon, and regulating it, as other particularly lethal weapons, I have advocated for,"" he said. ""As ATF director, if I'm confirmed, I would simply enforce the laws on the books and right now, there is no such ban on those guns."" Prior to joining Giffords, Chipman served the ATF as a special agent for 25 years. During his long career, he joined the agency's SWAT team, disrupted firearms trafficking operations between Virginia and New York and was named Special Agent in Charge of ATF’s Firearms Programs.",2021-05-26 20:00:51,Biden's nominee to lead ATF supports ban on AR-15 rifle,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

136,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/trauma-violence-united-states.html,"Advertisement Supported by Charles M. Blow By Charles M. Blow Opinion Columnist There was another mass shooting on Wednesday, this time leaving nine people dead, just one of the latest mass shootings of the 230-plus so far this year, according to a tally maintained by The New York Times. As The Times reported, “The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019.” We need to recognize the trauma and stress that we as a society have endured because of Covid-19, the collapse of our social structure, the crippling of an economy and the way the racial justice protests have unsettled some people. You add that to an already violent society, one saturated with guns and becoming even more saturated every day, and violence — including mass shootings — is a natural, horrific, inevitable outgrowth. I don’t think we fully understood and appreciated the palliative benefits of congregational opportunities for vulnerable communities, the way they provided outlet and relief, a respite from the pain of oppression and despair. Society needs an outlet valve, particularly at the bottom where the pressure is greatest, but Covid deprived us of that. Gunfire even erupted at George Floyd Square on Tuesday, sending activists and mourners scrambling — people who had gathered to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his murder. The surge of violence in Minneapolis has gotten so bad that the mayor has asked state and federal agencies for assistance because of a police shortage. According to The Star Tribune, nearly 200 officers have left the force in that city after the protests, many citing their own PTSD. But Minneapolis is not alone; violence is surging in cities around the country. Last year Los Angeles saw its highest level of homicides in a decade, and New York City saw a year-over-year spike from 2019 to 2020 that was larger than any increase since the 1970s, according to Rafael A. Mangual, a senior fellow and the deputy director of legal policy at The Manhattan Institute. And the violence isn’t just shootings. The incivility trickles down. Many of the people we considered essential workers, the ones who kept our society functioning, are the same people on the receiving end of much of the violence. There has been a surge in unruly passengers on airplanes. A Southwest Airlines flight attendant had two teeth knocked out over the weekend when she was attacked by a passenger. New York City bus drivers have seen a surge in violence, and the medical field, already suffering from a pre-Covid surge, has seen even more violence. This is all happening at the same time that we see an extraordinary surge in gun background checks and purchases during the pandemic. As The Washington Post reported in February: “More than 2 million firearms were bought last month, according to The Washington Post’s analysis of federal gun background-check data. That is an 80 percent year-over-year spike and the third-highest one-month total on record.” Many of the gun buyers are first-time gun buyers. Gun violence and gun sales are part of a self-perpetuating and mutually reinforcing phenomenon, and are only amplified by talk of gun control. As CNN put it in March: “The pattern of rising gun sales following mass shootings has held true regardless of which political party is in power: Fears of future restrictions prompt gun owners to stock up.” Indeed, one of the ironies of the Biden administration is that although the president has urged more gun control and taken some executive actions on the issue, both The Washington Examiner and Forbes have reported that stimulus checks issued while he was in office helped fuel the gun buying surge. As we begin to get back to normal, as some states plan to lift restrictions this summer, schools plan to reopen in the fall and in-office desk jobs begin to beckon stay-at-home workers, we must remember that there is a segment of society that will not so easily shake off the effects of this pandemic. Some parts of our society were already broken. Many of them we broke on purpose. Others, we simply ignored as the injury lingered. The pandemic has compounded the problems, compounded the stress, compounded the trauma. The New Yorker captured the dichotomy our society is experiencing in a headline that read, “The Great Coronavirus Divide: Wall Street Profits Surge as Poverty Rises.” The worn-out idiom was made true: The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. And the poor are in pain. The fragile and vulnerable in society are releasing a roar. Do we hear them? Things are not going to magically snap back to normal, to a normal that was already unacceptable for many. We have to find a way to collectively deal with what happened to our country during this pandemic, something beyond stimulus checks and infrastructure bills. To do that, we have to acknowledge this trauma and work through the soft power of congregation, sharing and listening. This is not a Congress initiative necessarily. This is a kitchen table initiative. This requires neighbor-to-neighbor outreach, communities communing. This requires some dish towel diplomacy: standing in kitchens over a cup of coffee and confessing to how hard this all has been and being seen, truly seen, by the person doing the hearing.

In March, Biden proposed spending $5 billion on community-led gun violence prevention programs, setting the stage for what would be a historically large outlay from the federal government for anti-violence work. The following month, in response to a series of high-profile mass shootings, he announced a slew of executive actions directing the Department of Justice to: In what could be the most consequential move, Biden also nominated David Chipman, a retired agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to lead the agency he once served. The ATF falls under the Justice Department and is the only federal agency tasked specifically with regulating the gun industry. It has lacked a permanent director since 2015. Chipman, now senior policy advisor for the gun control group Giffords, faces a tough confirmation battle in the Senate, where he appeared before the Judiciary Committee for a hearing on Wednesday. If approved, he will be in charge of reforming an agency that has repeatedly come under fire from both the left and the right for how it polices gun sellers. More: Biden's nominee to lead ATF supports ban on AR-15 rifle So far, Biden has not proposed any specific changes for the ATF, nor hinted at plans to increase the agency’s funding. An investigation by The Trace and USA TODAY found that congressional restrictions, anemic funding and increasingly lax internal policies have weakened the ATF’s enforcement of the laws governing gun shops and other types of federally licensed firearm dealers. The ATF allowed some sellers to go years without receiving an inspection, the reporters found. When inspectors did show up, they often discovered violations of state and federal gun laws. Most cases resulted in the ATF either not punishing violators at all or issuing them a written warning – the lowest penalty available. It was exceedingly rare for the agency to shut down even the serious violators. The findings come against a backdrop of spiking gun sales and violence. The coronavirus pandemic and civil unrest spurred Americans to purchase a record-breaking 22 million guns in 2020. Violence increased, too. More than 19,000 people were killed by guns – excluding suicides – last year, a 26% increase over 2019, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive. The surge in violence has continued into this year as cities across the country reported a stream of shootings that put them on track to break 2020 totals. At Giffords, Chipman advocated for legislation to make it easier for the ATF to hold dealers accountable. In a 2013 op-ed for Politico, he bemoaned the ATF’s lack of resources as a hindrance to inspecting gun sellers on a regular basis, adding that the “gun lobby wins when ATF is inconsistent, distrusted and worthy of criticism.” Chipman declined to comment pending his Senate confirmation hearing, but he told senators on Wednesday that if they approved his nomination, he would review the inspection division’s operations thoroughly. “We have to ensure that ATF inspectors are targeting those firearms dealers most at risk,” he said. The ATF has been overseen by a series of acting leaders since 2006, when the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied Congress to take away the president’s power to appoint the agency’s director without Senate approval. Over the past 15 years, the gun lobby’s congressional allies blocked every nominee with the exception of B. Todd Jones, who was confirmed in 2013 but stepped down from the post two years later. “The gun lobby has been committed to the idea of trying to cripple the ATF, and they have put pressure on their allies in Congress to do that over the years. So the agency has often operated at a much, much lower level of effectiveness than they are capable of,” said John Donohue, a law professor and economist at Stanford University. “I think the hope for the Biden administration is that the goals of the ATF can actually be realized with a good leader.” In 2008, Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo and David Vitter of Louisiana, all Republicans, derailed the confirmation of President George W. Bush’s ATF director nominee over a dispute in which the lawmakers accused the agency of being overly aggressive in policing gun dealers. In 2020, conservatives derailed Donald Trump’s nomination of Chuck Canterbury, the former president of the Fraternal Order of Police, over concerns he would support expanded background checks for firearm purchases, among other gun control measures. Trump withdrew his nomination after Canterbury’s nomination lagged in the Senate. Carlton Bowers, a former ATF official who worked under Chipman before they both retired from the agency in 2012, said having a confirmed director could breathe new life into the agency’s regulatory enforcement. “Acting directors catch a lot of flack from other senior people because they are just acting,” Bowers said. “But when you are confirmed as the director of ATF, you have more respect. ” The Senate’s Judiciary Committee chairman, Democrat Dick Durbin, said that he was focused on ensuring Chipman clears the 51-vote margin needed to install him in the post, even if that means obtaining a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Kamala Harris. “How many times have you heard it said, ‘We don’t need new laws, we just need to enforce the laws on the books,’” Durbin said in a Senate floor speech in April. “What the gun lobby has done over the years is make sure the ATF doesn’t have any money and doesn’t have any leaders. We haven’t had anyone in the post in six years with Senate confirmation, and I want to change that.” In late April, a group of nine Republican lawmakers called on Durbin and ranking Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to oppose Chipman’s nomination. Taylor Foy, a Grassley spokesperson, said, “Mr. Chipman has made no bones about his desire to further restrict gun ownership.” Foy said plenty of gun laws were already in place. “We’ve seen too many tragic events that could have been stopped if laws already on the books were properly enforced,” he said, “and the ATF shares responsibility for improved enforcement.” Biden has evolved from a pro-gun Democrat to a staunch ally of gun violence prevention groups. He helped pass the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, an NRA-backed law preventing the ATF from inspecting gun dealers more than once a year and curbing the agency’s ability to shut them down. In the early 1990s, Biden fought against the NRA to ensure congressional passage of the Brady Bill, which established background checks for prospective gun purchasers. Biden made combating gun violence a key plank of his platform for the 2020 presidential campaign. He promised to strengthen the background check system, restrict access to assault-style weapons and hold gun manufacturers accountable for harm caused by their products. Some of Biden’s legislative objectives face hurdles in Congress, where Republicans are united in opposition and some Democrats have also expressed misgivings. Advocates, meanwhile, have pointed to the ATF’s inspections program as another issue the president could change without congressional approval. Chelsea Parsons, vice president of gun violence prevention at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, said a confirmed director would help the ATF make changes in the face of pushback from the gun industry. “If you don’t have stable, confirmed leadership that has the backing of the administration and Congress,” Parsons said, “then it makes it much more difficult to deal with the problems that we’re seeing with how the ATF’s regulating the industry.” Contributing: Brian Freskos, The Trace and Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY",2021-05-26 20:29:42,Agent turned activist nominated by Biden could lead ATF to new era of cracking down on problem gun dealers,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Behind the counter hung the linchpin of Uncle Sam’s business: guns. The woman flashed her credentials, which revealed that she was an investigator with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun industry watchdog. She was here to make sure Uncle Sam’s had cleaned up its act. This was the ATF’s third inspection of Uncle Sam’s in seven years. The two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers. At one point, ATF records show, more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found – a red flag for gun trafficking. In both cases, the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping Uncle Sam’s of its license to sell guns, according to ATF records. But agency officials decided to spare the shop, issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules. As the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014, she discovered that things had hardly improved. Sales records were incomplete, the store failed to report required information to law enforcement, and safety notices still weren’t going out. The inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors. Their decision: Issue yet another warning. Months later, the ATF learned that Uncle Sam’s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme. Witnesses told the agency that Steven Adkins, a longtime shop employee who’d purchased a stake in the business, had enlisted a host of people, including a colleague’s girlfriend and his brother-in-law, to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions, according to court records. In reality, the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay-to-play scheme at a local mine. Others were sold on the black market, witnesses said. One accomplice told investigators “hundreds, if not thousands of firearms” had been trafficked through Uncle Sam’s. According to court records, he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store, loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon. Another accomplice said he drove guns from Uncle Sam’s to Adkins’s home, where Adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement. Adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to August 2014. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison. No one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme. “Everybody knew where to get a firearm: Adkins,” said Roger D.B. Muncy, whose father founded Uncle Sam’s in 1975. “We’re all human, but you don’t send guns out the back door.” The ATF is facing intense scrutiny as the Senate considers President Joe Biden’s pick for the agency’s first permanent director in six years. The confirmation of David Chipman, a former ATF agent who has advocated stricter gun laws, is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the White House to clamp down on easy access to firearms. In one of the most sweeping examinations of ATF inspection records, The Trace and USA TODAY found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory, bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as Uncle Sam’s – and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals. Gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the USA. The Trace and USA TODAY’s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries. Reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2,000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017. The reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules, selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers, lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct. In many cases when the ATF caught dealers breaking the law, the agency issued warnings, sometimes repeatedly, and allowed the stores to operate for months or years. Others are still selling guns to this day. More than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly, waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results. More than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them. Dozens made false statements in official records, a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases. A Florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a Taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot, and an Arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he’d failed the background check because of an active restraining order. In Ohio, one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times; another was missing some 600 firearms. A Pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the ATF. But the store was allowed to remain in business, and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members, including his 7-year-old half-brother. The reports were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the gun control group Brady and shared with The Trace and USA TODAY reporters, who conducted an independent analysis. The reports detail inspections of brick-and-mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers, including home-based sellers, independent mom-and-pops and big-box retailers such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Others cover gun manufacturers and importers. Investigate: Read this story at The Trace The data is extensive, but may not be comprehensive. The agency provided Brady roughly 2,000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters, warning conferences and license revocations over the two-year span from July 2015 through June 2017. However, annual fact sheets published by the ATF include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, a period that overlaps with the Brady documents. The ATF repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating. A single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if ATF officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations. In the vast majority of the cases analyzed by The Trace and USA TODAY, the ATF gave violators the lightest penalty available: a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to “reduce violent crime and protect the public.” The agency revoked a gun dealer’s license in less than 3% of cases. Gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear. One owner told an ATF investigator that he was “busy” and didn’t “give a s---,” the agency records show. Another said he “did not like being told what to do.” The owner of a pawn shop in northeastern Kansas became “very belligerent and hostile” when questioned about falsifying records, shaking his finger in the investigator’s face as he told her to “do her job and stop messing with him.” The ATF allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms. Joseph Bisbee, a retired ATF agent in Seattle, said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity. “There’s really no teeth to the laws, and gun dealers know that,” he said. “They can see that nobody gets prosecuted, that nobody gets held accountable, and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it.” The problems extend high into the management ranks of ATF. The Trace and USA TODAY’s review found that the managers of on-the-ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments. Reporters identified 138 reports in which ATF officials acknowledged that a dealer’s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses. The agency revoked 56 of those licenses, just over 40%. A majority were granted lesser penalties, ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters. In the reports, ATF officials justified backing off by citing the dealer’s age, recent health problems, intentions to retire and, in one case, “affluent clientele.” One dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year; another because he had been in business for decades. Sometimes, the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue. In 2017, an inspector advocated pulling the license for Back Acre Gun Works after reporting the gun shop west of Orlando, Florida, had falsified records related to the transfer of an AR-15-style rifle. A supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning, noting “substantial legal liabilities” because the inspection had been conducted “prematurely.” Current and former ATF officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency’s enforcement powers. Some also say the ATF has increasingly adopted an industry-friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority. “They hardly do any inspections, and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they’re not a big deal because they don’t want to upset the industry too much,” said Mark Jones, who held various supervisory positions at the ATF before retiring in 2012. The proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across America, ripe for targeting by criminals. Kris Brown, Brady’s president, said the ATF “bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity.” “And Americans every day pay the price,” Brown said, “particularly Black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers.” The coronavirus pandemic, protests against police brutality and the election of Biden spurred Americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020, shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the ATF can adequately police such a booming industry. “The most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands,” said John Crecca, a former ATF inspector who worked in New York and Pennsylvania before retiring in 2011. Crecca recalled the case of Bull’s Eye Shooter Supply, a gun store in Tacoma, Washington, that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks, in which two gunmen armed with a Bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people. One of the Beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from Bull’s Eye. The shop hadn’t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling. A subsequent ATF inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns. Bull’s Eye settled the lawsuit for $2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings. In the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license, the process is slow, often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns. Sometimes, the ATF holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory, reports show. The ATF is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market. The agency’s weaknesses have prompted Illinois, New Jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs. In Illinois, the ATF held warning conferences with 1st Class Firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of Waukegan had failed to conduct background checks, kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out-of-state residents, records show. Allowed to remain in business, 1st Class Firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the U.S. from Mexico, according to court records. Inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st Class Firearms for 12 more violations. This time, agency officials determined that the store’s license should be revoked. According to records, one supervisor railed against the owner, Craig Bricco, for “displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements.” Bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees, who ran the store while he was working another job during the day. “I got bamboozled,” Bricco said. “There wasn’t much I could do.” Instead of revoking his license, Bricco said the ATF allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms. Bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer’s license after that period, but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer. He rebranded as 1st Class Ammo and transferred the shop’s leftover gun inventory to himself — a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales. In much of the country, private sales require no background checks. In January 2016, 1st Class Ammo shared a Facebook post directing people to GunBroker.com, where Bricco was selling four Sig Sauer pistols. “So it’s a private sale?” one Facebook user asked. “Yes, all private sales,” 1st Class Ammo responded, “you can see them on display in the ammo store.” Some current and former ATF officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers obey the rules without driving them out of business for fleeting missteps and unintentional errors. Thomas Brandon, the bureau’s acting director from 2015 to 2019, said the goal is not to penalize gun shops and other federal firearms licensees but to gain their compliance. “The high majority of FFLs are good hardworking people running businesses, and they’re our front-line of defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases,” Brandon said. Brandon, who now works in sales for a ballistics technology firm that contracts with the ATF and law enforcement, said the agency focuses its limited resources on “the 1% doing it wrong.” In an emailed response to questions, ATF spokesman Andre Miller portrayed the penalties as “tools to guide” dealers into correcting violations and “ensure future compliance.” He said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider “the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide.” “The nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as ATF’s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action,” Miller said. A DIVISION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, the ATF is responsible for policing the 78,000 gun dealers, manufacturers and importers in the U.S. It employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews, digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn’t have them. The goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years. But federal data shows the agency has averaged 15% of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019. This means dealers were visited about once every seven years. Of all the inspections during that decade, at least a third – 35,500 – found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws, the agency data shows. More than 81% of violators received no penalty or a written warning. The ATF sought revocation of only 580 violators, or 1.6%. In the 2020 fiscal year, as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations, the ATF inspected only 5,827 licensed dealers, or 7.5% – the lowest annual inspection rate since 2004. More than 2,400 of those dealers were found to have committed violations. Forty dealers had their licenses revoked. The most common violations cited by the ATF were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers’ personal details, omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records, according to the reports analyzed by The Trace and USA TODAY. Former ATF officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales. But even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer’s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking, or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes. “Whenever you hear people say ‘There’s plenty of laws on the books,’ there really aren’t. What there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper,” said Scot Thomasson, the ATF’s former chief of public affairs. “But what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime, a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market.” Gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection. Former ATF officials attributed the agency’s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability. Over the past 35 years, gun groups have successfully pressured Congress to limit the frequency of inspections, restrict ATF from consolidating and computerizing records, and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers’ licenses away. In 1986, the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied for the passage of the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act, which prevents the ATF from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year. After 9/11, Congress required that the ATF audit each of the nation’s 9,400 explosives dealers once every three years – effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections. The number of gun dealer inspections plunged, falling from an average of nearly 12,000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7,000 a year in the 2000s. “ATF is a very small agency, a very unpopular agency, and as a result, there are a lot of people trying to push them around,” said Howard Wolfe, a former ATF supervisor who oversaw inspections in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania until he retired in 2006. Wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the ATF’s inspection goals. “There was no way,” Wolfe said. “People went years without being inspected, and that’s a big problem, because how do you know how somebody’s doing if you don’t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records?” ATF investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by The Trace and USA TODAY. One particularly taxing case, in Houston, took 995 hours, the equivalent of half a year of workdays. The investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director, who cited the “length of time taken to complete the assignment.” In another case in Kansas, A Pawn Shop transferred an AK-47-type rifle and a Glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend, a convicted felon, court records indicate. In February 2016, he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of Newton and Hesston. An ATF inspector visited A Pawn Shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper IDs, sold a handgun to a self-identified domestic abuser, and hadn’t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers, according to an agency report. The ATF downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business. “Had the ATF gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act. It might have prevented a mass shooting,” said David Morantz, an attorney who represented one of the Hesston shooting victims’ surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop. The lawsuit resulted in a $2 million settlement. The shop is now closed. Teresa Ficaretta, a former senior ATF attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law, said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns, frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags. Ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law. “If licensees knew that ATF was going to show up like clockwork, they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance,” she said. “But right now there’s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens.” The size of the ATF’s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades. In early 2016, after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, the Obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly $12.3 million to add 120 ATF investigators. The Republican-controlled Congress balked, with one GOP member of the House Appropriations Committee saying lawmakers would not support “the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous Second Amendment rights of Americans.” B. Todd Jones, a former U.S. attorney who served as the ATF’s last Senate-confirmed leader before resigning in 2015, said that despite the “20-plus years of regulatory handcuffs,” investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight. “We did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders,” said Jones, who is now chief disciplinary officer for the NFL. “It’s like setting up a speed trap: You’re not going to stop everyone. And if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it. But what’s the alternative? No regulation at all?” The ATF investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests. They can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties, known as “adverse actions,” but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations, who make the final call. The Trace and USA TODAY found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions. For example, at the Louisville field division – which covers Kentucky, West Virginia and southern Indiana – reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer’s violations warranted revocation. Nine of those recommendations were approved by the division’s industry operations director. In contrast, the industry operations director for the Seattle field division – which covers Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam – approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators. Jim Zammillo, a former ATF deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010, said the Justice Department’s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently, prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s. Chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found. The guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses, and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters. Know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the ATF? Share this story The increased oversight led to greater standardization, Zammillo said, but it also caused consternation among field division heads. “They viewed it like, ‘I’m the sheriff, this is my department, and I’m going to run it the way that I want to,’” Zammillo said. John Jarowski, a former industry operations director in St. Paul, Minnesota, offered another explanation, saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators. “Inspectors go in and they want the kill. They want the scalp on their belt,” Jarowski said. Proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court, a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years. U.S. attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the ATF. “Many times when the U.S. attorney steps in he’d say, ‘This dog won’t hunt,’ and they’d drop it,” Jarowski said. “So you have to think about spending your resources wisely.” In many areas of civil and criminal law, defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior. When it comes to gun sellers, Congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully, forcing the ATF to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them. Jack & Dick’s Pawn Shop in Junction City, Kansas, received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016. When the ATF returned in 2017, it uncovered four additional violations, including making false statements in required records, a report shows. The false statements charge stemmed from the case of a Fort Riley army soldier who’d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop, according to a police report. The soldier, 20, was underage for handgun purchases in Kansas. He had had a friend fill out the paperwork. ATF records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke Jack & Dick’s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase, including when the friend paid using the soldier’s credit card. The investigator was overruled by higher-ups, who said it wasn’t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card. The ATF decided to give Jack & Dick’s another written warning. The owner of the shop declined to comment for this article. In 2017 and 2020, the shop released surveillance photos and video on its Facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime. When the ATF does decide to revoke a dealer’s license, the agency’s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands. JC’s Guns & Tackle Shop in Huntsville, Alabama, received its first compliance inspection in 2013, resulting in a warning conference. Investigators returned two years later for a second inspection that uncovered 13 violations, six of them repeated, according to an ATF report. The shop had failed to report multiple sales, falsified forms and sold guns to people who’d self-identified as being prohibited. It failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees, which is illegal, the report indicates. Investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases, selling weapons to stand-ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed. It took the ATF 16 months to revoke JC’s license. During that time, according to court records, the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend, a convicted felon. Gun store owners offered the ATF a litany of excuses to explain away violations. The agency spared a Nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was  “very busy and overwhelmed.” A Pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales. During the last inspection, in 2016, the owner told an ATF investigator he meant to file the reports “but did not get around to it.” Felex Yukhtman said he trusted the “wrong people” to manage his small gun manufacturing business in Bradenton, Florida. Yukhtman’s company, Gun Point, specializes in building custom ARs. In 2017, an ATF supervisor upheld an inspector’s recommendation to shut Yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations. They included the possession of illegal machine guns, later seized by agents. Yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms, he said in an interview. The supervisor criticized Yukhtman for having “shown a pattern of repeated violations” despite the ATF “educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008.” The industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned Yukhtman in for another warning conference. Yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the ATF for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes. “They’re not there to take your license or make your life miserable,” Yukhtman said. “The less work they have to do at your store, the less time they have to be there, the better it is for them.” To obtain a federal firearms sales license, applicants have to mail in their fingerprints and a photograph along with a four-page form containing basic business and biographical information. The form also requires applicants to check a box to indicate whether they have a felony conviction, were ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms. The price of a firearms license ranges from $30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as $3,000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades. The license held by many retail gun dealers costs $200 for the first three years and $90 for every renewal. Applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test. The ATF instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business. Still, ATF officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency. A dealer in Pounding Mill, Virginia, avoided a warning conference after expressing “his apparent shock,” according to a report, at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back-to-back handgun purchases. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry’s trade group, works with the ATF to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking. “By and large, firearm retailers are law-abiding and follow local, state and federal authorities,” said Mark Oliva, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman. “We’re members of our community, mom-and-pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe.” The foundation recruits consultants and former ATF inspectors to put shops through mock inspections. For $750, the organization will run a full-day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings. It also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders, which Oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year. But Rich Marianos, a former ATF assistant director, said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible. In 2020, it spent $4.5 million on lobbying, more than twice as much as the National Rifle Association, which spent $2.2 million, according to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics. “They’re like the NRA,” Marianos said. “Never once have they said the ATF needs more money, help, support or resources.” Oliva disputes that characterization. He provided confidential records of the group’s lobbying of Congress in recent years to add millions for ATF’s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the Department of Justice. THE CALL THAT STARTED THE UNRAVELING of the gun trafficking operation at Uncle Sam's in West Virginia came in April 2015. The girlfriend of a former employee contacted an ATF agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store’s records as the purchaser of shotguns, rifles and a pistol. According to court records, she later told an ATF agent that Steven Adkins had paid her $75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person. It was a scheme Adkins had been running for at least six years, and he’d kept it hidden from the ATF even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe. After being indicted in late 2015, Adkins told the ATF that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store’s founder, Roger D. Muncy. According to court records, Adkins claimed Muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales, and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms, Muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through. Adkins estimated that 70% of the gun sales at Uncle Sam’s were illegal. The case reverberated across the small town of Man, where Adkins and Muncy were serving on the city council. In 2008, the city had renamed a street in Muncy’s honor. Adkins pleaded guilty in 2016, and the ATF pulled Uncle Sam’s gun license. Adkins, who has since been released from prison, declined requests to be interviewed for this article. Muncy was never charged, but the revocation didn’t stop him from profiting from guns. After losing the license to sell firearms at Uncle Sam’s, he rented the store to a state trooper, who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location. The arrangement lasted until July 2019, when the two parties had a falling out. In his testimony, Muncy denied wrongdoing in the Adkins case. He went on to operate Uncle Sam’s as a pawn shop until he died in December at the age of 68. His wife died four days later. Since then, the day-to-day management of the store has fallen to their son, Roger D.B. Muncy, who hopes to get back in the gun business. “The day my daddy and mommy died, I was calling Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms wanting to know if I was able to get a firearms license,” he said. “They said I need to file my application.” For this project, USA TODAY partnered with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to improving public understanding of gun violence, increasing accountability and identifying solutions.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News correspondent Claudia Cowan joins 'Special Report' with the latest on the workplace massacre President Biden, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other prominent Democrats renewed calls for tighter gun laws on Wednesday after a deadly mass shooting at a California rail yard. At least eight people were killed when an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority opened fire early Wednesday morning. The suspected gunman, Samuel Cassidy, took his own life as authorities responded to the scene. ""Once again, I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America,"" Biden said in a statement. ""Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more."" Biden has pushed an overhaul of gun laws in recent weeks in response to mass shootings across multiple states. In April, Biden unveiled a slate of executive actions aimed at curbing gun violence, including tightened restrictions on so-called homemade ""ghost guns"" and pistol-stabilizing braces. He also called on the Justice Department to develop legislation for a ""red flag"" law that would temporarily block individuals identified as potential threats from possessing guns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The debate over gun legislation has prompted heated clashes between Democratic and Republican lawmakers in recent years. Prominent Republicans have accused their political rivals of politicizing instances of gun violence to push long-desired changes to the Second Amendment, while Democrats argue the GOP’s unwillingness to tighten laws has contributed to a wave of mass shootings. Newsom issued a similar call for action in response to the San Jose shooting. In the past, the California governor has blamed Republican lawmakers for failing to take action on gun control. ""What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us? Newsom said. ""When are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms – literally and figuratively – our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration, more scenes like this, repeated over and over and over again.""

News By Kenneth Garger Submit May 26, 2021 | 9:15pm				| Updated May 27, 2021 | 8:04am The California light-rail facility worker who killed eight people at his workplace before turning the gun on himself “had two sides” to him and would often complain about his colleagues and bosses, his ex-wife said. “When he was in a good mood he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad,” Cecilia Nelms, 64, told the Bay Area News Group on Wednesday, referring to her ex-husband Samuel Cassidy. Early Wednesday morning, Cassidy, 57, carried out the deadly attack at San Jose’s VTA Light Rail Facility — where he worked as a substation maintainer, according to officials and reports. Nelms and Cassidy were married for about 10 years, she told the news group, and during that time he would frequently rant about work. Cassidy, who also set his home ablaze before the mass shooting, would angrily vent about multiple facets of his job, including his assignments and the people he worked with, according to Nelms. “He just thought that some people got more easy-going things at work, and he’d get the harder jobs,” she told the news group. Multiple weapons and ammunition were found inside Cassidy’s home and the attack appears to be related to a workplace issue, the Los Angeles Times reported. Nelms said she was unaware of Cassidy owning guns when they were together. In 2009, about four years after the former couple filed for divorce, a girlfriend of Cassidy accused him of rape and sexual assault, according to court documents obtained by the Bay Area News Group. “Several times during the relationship he became intoxicated, enraged and forced himself on me sexually,” the now-ex-girlfriend wrote in a sworn declaration.

On Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the deceased victims as 42-year-old Paul Delacruz Megia, 36-year-old Taptejdeep Singh, 29-year-old Adrian Balleza, 35-year-old Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 49-year-old Timothy Michael Romo, 40-year-old Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 63-year-old Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63-year-old Lars Kepler Lane and 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. The Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said Cassidy was also found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. “He had two sides,” his ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told this news organization in an interview. “When he was in a good mood he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad.” During a sweep of the maintenance yard, emergency responders found two bodies on the second floor of a building and five “10-55s,” or coroner’s cases, inside another part of the facility, according to the audio logs. An eighth person was found outside and rushed to a hospital. Two victims were ultimately transferred to Valley Medical Center in San Jose. One was dead on arrival and the other was in critical condition, hospital spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said. The second victim later died of his injuries.

146,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/fox-news-guest-san-jose-mass-shooting-covid-vaccinations,"As news of a mass shooting at a San Jose, California rail yard broke on Wednesday morning, leaving at least eight people dead, retired NYPD detective Pat Brosnan took to Fox News to suggest that the country’s gun violence epidemic will worsen as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19. “Once COVID starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations,” Brosnan said. “You can be sure they probably got vaccinated. They were just scared to come out.” Brosnan added that active shootings are “skyrocketing” throughout the U.S. as the country begins showing signs of recovery from the pandemic. Brosnan’s remarks were in response to news that a transit worker allegedly opened fire at a light-rail yard in San Jose reportedly killing at least eight people, many of whom were coworkers of the suspected shooter at the Valley Transportation Authority. The alleged gunman also died, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. San Jose city councilman Raul Peralez said that the shooting occurred during a union meeting in a building with about 80 people. The Wall Street Journal reported that the shooter had multiple firearms, citing a law-enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Although the lack of large gatherings during COVID lockdowns made for fewer mass shootings compared to years past, the epidemic of gun violence in the country remained an ongoing threat during the pandemic. By some metrics, such as data collected by the Gun Violence Archive — which defines mass shootings as a minimum of four victims shot (either fatally or not) excluding any alleged shooter’s death or injury during an attack — mass shootings actually rose sharply in 2020. Brosnan’s unsubstantiated prediction of an increase in mass shootings in the country due to more Americans getting vaccinated also falls in line with a common theme at Fox News. Commentators have been airing mixed messages about whether viewers should get inoculated against the infectious disease. And Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who routinely leads the network in primetime ratings, has consistently espoused misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines during his show by relying on unverified data.

Read more about the investigation here. From CNN’s Sarah Moon Sam Cassidy, the suspected gunman in the mass shooting at a San Jose light rail yard where eight people were killed Wednesday, spoke angrily about his coworkers and resented his work, his ex-wife told a Northern California news outlet. “He had two sides,” Cassidy’s ex-wife Cecilia Nelms told the Bay Area News Group, a CNN-affiliate, outside her home Wednesday. “When he was in a good mood, he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad.” Nelms told the outlet, “he often spoke angrily about his co-workers and bosses, and at times directed his anger at her.” Cassidy and all of the victims were employees of the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), officials said. Authorities have not identified a motive in the shooting and it is not yet clear whether those killed were targeted. According to the Bay Area News Group, Nelms said during their marriage, Cassidy “resented what he saw as unfair work assignments” and “would rant about his job when he got home.” Nelms, reached by CNN on Facebook, did not respond to questions about Cassidy. Subsequent phone calls went unanswered. Nelms was married to Cassidy for about 10 years until the couple filed for divorce in 2005. She has not been in touch with her ex-husband for about 13 years, according to the outlet. “He just thought that some people got more easy-going things at work, and he’d get the harder jobs,” she reportedly told the Bay Area News Group. From CNN’s Sarah Moon   The bodies of six shooting victims are still inside the buildings where this morning’s mass shooting occurred at a San Jose light rail yard, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Of the eight people who were killed by a gunman, six bodies remain inside two Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) buildings and two victims were transported to a hospital, Smith said. All victims were VTA employees. The crime scene is still being processed and the coroner is working to notify victims’ next of kin, Smith added. According to the sheriff, deputies responded to the scene as shots were still being fired in the building. Deputies were able to go inside and confront the suspect, who killed himself, she said. Bomb-making equipment and ammunition were also found at the VTA yard, according to Smith. The body of the suspect, identified by sources as Sam Cassidy, was moved from where he shot himself in an attempt to administer medical aid and is on now on a street, Smith said. From CNN’s Cheri Mossburg Multiple guns were used in today's deadly mass shooting at a light rail yard in San Jose, Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said at a news conference. Rosen did not specify the types of weapons used in the shooting or whether they were obtained legally, but said they were not considered to be untraceable “ghost guns.” Officials are still working to notify the families of the eight victims killed in the shooting, Rosen said, but he expects all notifications will be complete by the end of the day. The district attorney said he did not know whether there may have been any red flags about the shooter’s intentions ahead of the tragedy. A family assistance center has been created to help the family members, and witnesses, along with anyone affected by the shooting. “We know tragically, that mass shootings affect different people in different ways,” said Rosen. “Sadly, we have experience with these shootings,” he added, referring to the 2019 mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. “Honestly, I pray that this is the last time we have to open such a center in our county. We are going to do everything we can today in in the weeks and months ahead to support all of the victims and their families. And we're also going to do everything that we can to find out if there's anything that could have been done to prevent this tragedy. In the last two years in our county.”  From CNN’s Cheri Mossburg A vigil honoring the victims of the mass shooting at the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail yard in San Jose is planned for Thursday evening. The 9 p.m. ET vigil will take place at the San Jose City Hall Plaza. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, members of the San Jose City Council, and VTA representatives will be in attendance.  From CNN's Kelsie Smith Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot took a moment to acknowledge the mass shooting in San Jose on Wednesday following a city council meeting, calling the event a ""terrible tragedy."" The mayor said she has reached out to San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and will continue to push and advocate for additional common sense gun reforms. ""It's way past time for us to act and do something to stop these kinds of mass shootings,"" said Lightfoot. ""We don't know all the details yet, so I won't opine about the motive or methods of the shooter, but this is a very, very sad day and a hard day for the city of San Jose.""  From CNN’s Sarah Moon   The suspect in this morning’s mass shooting at the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail yard in San Jose knew the shooting victims, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told CNN’s Jake Tapper. The gunman, identified by sources as Sam Cassidy, was also a VTA employee, according to Liccardo. Authorities confirmed Cassidy died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. While the names of the victims have not been released, Liccardo said he has spoken to three families. The victims, VTA employees, were working at a light rail maintenance facility. Liccardo described them as “essential workers” who risked their lives and showed up every day throughout the pandemic. Liccardo said explosives have been found at one of the crime scenes, and noted investigators are “moving very slowly and very carefully in multiple scenes right now to try to put the pieces together to understand exactly what happened.” From CNN's DJ Judd   Flags have been lowered at the White House to honor the victims of a mass shooting in San Jose that left eight dead earlier today. President Biden said in a statement today that it is the fifth time he’s ordered flags to be flown at half-staff following a mass shooting in America.   From CNN’s Cheri Mossburg The Federal Bureau of Investigation and theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office with the investigation into the shooting at the Valley Transit Authority that left eight employees dead, officials said at a news conference. The FBI is helping with evidence, response and recovery, according to Craig Fair, special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of the FBI. The federal agency will provide ballistics, technical forensic equipment, and analysis, along with additional personnel to help analyze the “very sizable crime scene,” Fair said. The ATF has brought in five bomb-sniffing dogs to assist in the search for any potential explosives. The agency is also providing investigative resources to trace firearms and ballistics evidence in an effort to link it to other firearm crimes that might be involved, said Joshua Jackson, special agent in charge for the ATF. From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury   California Gov. Gavin Newsom expressed frustration over the trend of mass shootings in the United States at a news conference following today's deadly shooting at a San Jose light rail yard. ""There is a numbness, I imagine, some of us are feeling about this because there's a sameness to this, you know anywhere, USA. It just feels like it happens over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat,"" Newsom said. Newsom recalled past mass shooting incidents that occurred in his state including, the Gilroy Garlic festival shooting and the San Bernardino shooting. Newsom continued by thanking the swift action of law enforcement who rushed to the scene and offered words of support to the victims and their families.

(AP Photo/Noah Berger) Noah Berger  SAN JOSE, Calif. — An employee opened fire Wednesday at a California rail yard serving Silicon Valley, killing eight people before ending his own life, authorities said. The shooting took place around 6:30 a.m. in two buildings that are part of a light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority, which provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the most populated county in the Bay Area. The facility includes a transit-control center, parking for trains and a maintenance yard. The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive. Sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Russell Davis said the attack also resulted in “multiple major injuries.” He did not know the type of weapon used. Authorities did not identify any of the victims, who included VTA employees. “These folks were heroes during COVID-19. The buses never stopped running. VTA didn’t stop running. They just kept at work, and now we’re really calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy,” Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said it was his understanding the shooting happened during a meeting. Grief-stricken families sat huddled together, holding hands and crying, after learning they had lost a loved one, Rosen told reporters, describing the scene inside a county building. “They’re just sitting and holding hands and crying,” Rosen said. “It’s terrible. It’s awful. It’s raw. People are learning they lost their husband, their son, their brother.” He said about 100 people were inside the family reunification center. Police vehicles and orange crime-scene tape blocked off the area, and reporters were kept at a distance The rail yard is in the city’s administrative neighborhood, near the sheriff’s office and city and county offices. Bomb squads were searching the rail complex after receiving information about possible explosive devices, Davis said. Officials were also investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned a two-story home where firefighters responded Wednesday morning. Fire crews found a fast-moving blaze after being notified by a passer-by. A neighboring house also caught fire, authorities said. Cassidy had worked for the VTA since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database known as Transparent California. His position from 2012 to 2014 was listed as a mechanic. After that, he was a substation maintainer, the records said. VTA trains were already out on morning runs when the shooting occurred. Light rail service was to be suspended at noon and replaced with bus bridges, Hendricks told a news conference. “It’s just very difficult for everyone to be able try to wrap their heads around and understand what has happened,” Hendricks said. Outside the scene, Michael Hawkins told The Mercury News that he was waiting for his mother, Rochelle Hawkins, who had called him from a co-worker’s phone to assure him that she was safe. When the shooting started, “she got down with the rest of her co-workers” and dropped her cellphone, Michael Hawkins told the newspaper. Rochelle Hawkins did not see the shooter, and she was not sure how close she had been to the attacker, her son said. Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke emotionally in front of a county office where flags flew at half-staff. He said victims’ relatives were “waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother their son, their dad, their mom is still alive.” The bloodshed comes in a year that has seen a sharp increase in mass killings as the nation emerges from pandemic restrictions that closed many public places and kept people confined to their homes. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks every mass killing over the last 15 years shows that the San Jose attack is the 15th mass killing so far in 2021, all of them shootings. Eighty-six people have died in the shootings, compared with 106 for all of 2020. It is the sixth mass killing in a public place in 2021. The database defines mass killings as four people dead, not including the shooter, meaning the overall toll of gun violence is much higher when adding in smaller incidents. At the White House, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement. San Jose, the 10th-largest city in the U.S. with more than a million people, is about 50 miles south of San Francisco in the heart of Silicon Valley. In the city itself, the most recent mass shooting occurred in 2019 at a private home, according to The Mercury News. Police said it was a quadruple murder and suicide precipitated by family conflict. Wednesday’s attack was the county’s second shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people before killing himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019. ___ Associated Press writers Martha Mendoza in San Jose, Janie Har in San Francisco, John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles, and Michael Balsamo and Colleen Long in Washington also contributed to this report. ‘Housing takes time’: Northampton homeless settlers defy city deadline to move NORTHAMPTON — In November’s election, voters will be asked to choose two Trustees Under the Will of Charles E.

149,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/vta-mass-shooting-shock-grief-and-trying-to-cope-after-railyard-massacre/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — Early Wednesday morning, not long after Michael Hawkins Sr. watched his wife pull out of the driveway for her morning shift as a VTA train mechanic, a call came in from an unknown number. He didn’t answer. But when he listened to the voicemail, he had to replay the panicked message three times just to understand it. It was Rochelle, his wife. “Something was wrong,” Hawkins said. “She was out of breath. She couldn’t get out what she wanted to say.” All he heard was something about an active shooter at the VTA rail yard, and that she had dropped her own phone when she fled for her life. At about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, that maintenance yard on the edge of downtown San Jose became the scene of one of the deadliest mass shootings in Bay Area history. Nine people were killed from the same work crew, plus the shooter — a fellow employee armed and apparently loaded with resentments. The rampage was so chaotic that in the frantic escape, John Courtney, head of the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union, left his phone behind, too. Throughout the day, calls from desperate friends and family members went unanswered. At the union headquarters in Campbell on Wednesday afternoon, he opened the door a crack but held back on commenting, he said, “out of respect for the families.” One of the victims — 36-year-old Taptej Singh of Union City — had been identified late Wednesday afternoon before the names of the seven others were released soon after. But authorities remained tightlipped about what might have motivated the 57-year-old they identified as Samuel Cassidy to kill his coworkers, then turn the gun on himself. But in its aftermath, this mass shooting had all the hallmarks of so many others across the country: yellow police tape roping off blocks, lines of huddled workers escorted across parking lots, a “reunification” center for relatives to find loved ones — and the heartbreaking screams that came pouring outside. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen, whose office in the county administration building is a block away from the VTA rail yard and across the street from the Sheriff’s Department, took a seat in that crowded conference room. Families and coworkers held hands and wept. “It’s very raw. People are grieving. They’ve lost their husband, brother or son. It’s awful,” Rosen said in the plaza outside. “When people go to work in the morning and tell their wife or husband goodbye, they don’t think it’s goodbye forever.” San Jose is a city of more than a million people, the capital of Silicon Valley. But in many ways, it’s a small town. City Councilman Raul Peralez, who the night before had celebrated the approval of a landmark Google project for downtown San Jose, confirmed late Wednesday that a childhood friend was among the dead 2½ miles away. Peralez and his 40-year-old friend — Michael Joseph “Mikey” Rudometkin, an overhead line worker who was just finishing his shift at the time of the shooting — stood up in each other’s weddings. Peralez shared the dreaded news in an email late Wednesday, saying that learning of the loss of his old friend was “breaking my heart even further than it already was. I feel the same grief and agony that the families of the eight victims are experiencing right now, and am painfully aware that any words I share will not bring their loved ones back.” Throughout the day and throughout the Bay Area, VTA workers and their families were left stunned and bewildered that this was now their story. One man held his head in his hands on the edge of First Street, wiping away tears as he spoke with his wife on the phone. He didn’t know the victims personally, he said, “but they’re still my coworkers and I mourn the loss of their lives. That could have been me.’” VTA management, he said, “told us to go home.” They also told the workers not to talk to the media or identify themselves to reporters. But for some workers close to the tragedy, the horror was too great to keep in. “The whole crew is gone. The whole shift is gone,” said one man wearing a dark VTA uniform. “It’s horrible.” By mid-morning, Hawkins and his 19-year-old son, Michael Jr., arrived at the reunification center to give Rochelle the hugs she desperately needed. Her own car was in the parking lot cordoned off by police tape. Her phone remained inside the building, just where she left it when the gunshots rang out. She has worked for the VTA for 16 years. She knows many of the victims.Related Articles

150,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/26/vta-mass-shooting-shock-grief-and-trying-to-cope-after-railyard-massacre/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — Early Wednesday morning, not long after Michael Hawkins Sr. watched his wife pull out of the driveway for her morning shift as a VTA train mechanic, a call came in from an unknown number. He didn’t answer. But when he listened to the voicemail, he had to replay the panicked message three times just to understand it. It was Rochelle, his wife. “Something was wrong,” Hawkins said. “She was out of breath. She couldn’t get out what she wanted to say.” All he heard was something about an active shooter at the VTA rail yard, and that she had dropped her own phone when she fled for her life. At about 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, that maintenance yard on the edge of downtown San Jose became the scene of one of the deadliest mass shootings in Bay Area history. Nine people were killed from the same work crew, plus the shooter — a fellow employee armed and apparently loaded with resentments. The rampage was so chaotic that in the frantic escape, John Courtney, head of the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union, left his phone behind, too. Throughout the day, calls from desperate friends and family members went unanswered. At the union headquarters in Campbell on Wednesday afternoon, he opened the door a crack but held back on commenting, he said, “out of respect for the families.” One of the victims — 36-year-old Taptej Singh of Union City — had been identified late Wednesday afternoon before the names of the seven others were released soon after. But authorities remained tightlipped about what might have motivated the 57-year-old they identified as Samuel Cassidy to kill his coworkers, then turn the gun on himself. But in its aftermath, this mass shooting had all the hallmarks of so many others across the country: yellow police tape roping off blocks, lines of huddled workers escorted across parking lots, a “reunification” center for relatives to find loved ones — and the heartbreaking screams that came pouring outside. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen, whose office in the county administration building is a block away from the VTA rail yard and across the street from the Sheriff’s Department, took a seat in that crowded conference room. Families and coworkers held hands and wept. “It’s very raw. People are grieving. They’ve lost their husband, brother or son. It’s awful,” Rosen said in the plaza outside. “When people go to work in the morning and tell their wife or husband goodbye, they don’t think it’s goodbye forever.” San Jose is a city of more than a million people, the capital of Silicon Valley. But in many ways, it’s a small town. City Councilman Raul Peralez, who the night before had celebrated the approval of a landmark Google project for downtown San Jose, confirmed late Wednesday that a childhood friend was among the dead 2½ miles away. Peralez and his 40-year-old friend — Michael Joseph “Mikey” Rudometkin, an overhead line worker who was just finishing his shift at the time of the shooting — stood up in each other’s weddings. Peralez shared the dreaded news in an email late Wednesday, saying that learning of the loss of his old friend was “breaking my heart even further than it already was. I feel the same grief and agony that the families of the eight victims are experiencing right now, and am painfully aware that any words I share will not bring their loved ones back.” Throughout the day and throughout the Bay Area, VTA workers and their families were left stunned and bewildered that this was now their story. One man held his head in his hands on the edge of First Street, wiping away tears as he spoke with his wife on the phone. He didn’t know the victims personally, he said, “but they’re still my coworkers and I mourn the loss of their lives. That could have been me.’” VTA management, he said, “told us to go home.” They also told the workers not to talk to the media or identify themselves to reporters. But for some workers close to the tragedy, the horror was too great to keep in. “The whole crew is gone. The whole shift is gone,” said one man wearing a dark VTA uniform. “It’s horrible.” By mid-morning, Hawkins and his 19-year-old son, Michael Jr., arrived at the reunification center to give Rochelle the hugs she desperately needed. Her own car was in the parking lot cordoned off by police tape. Her phone remained inside the building, just where she left it when the gunshots rang out. She has worked for the VTA for 16 years. She knows many of the victims.Related Articles

In a statement after the incident, Biden said he was ordering officials to lower the flag at the White House to half-staff Friday ""yet again"" like in earlier instances of mass shootings in the United States. He also urged Congress to act on gun violence and “end the epidemic.” ""I have the solemn duty of ordering the flag lowered at half-staff at the White House, public buildings and grounds, and military posts and embassies, just two weeks after I gave the last such order,"" the president said. The flag at the White House and all other federal properties will be flown at half-staff until Sunday’s sunset. ""Enough,"" Biden said. ""Once again, I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America."" ""Gun violence is an epidemic in America. But we should not accept it. We must act,"" he said. An employee of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) opened fire on co-workers at a Northern California rail yard near 100 W. Younger Ave. around 6:34 a.m. PT Wednesday. The shooter, who was later identified as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, killed eight people and critically injured one person before turning the gun on himself, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said. Cassidy has previously been accused of raping and abusing an ex-girlfriend, who said he often had violent “mood swings,” court records obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle showed. “Several times during the relationship he became intoxicated, enraged and forced himself on me sexually,” the woman wrote in court documents. Vice President Kamala Harris said she has been briefed on the “horrific tragedy” and is urging Congress to take immediate action. ""I have family that lives in San Jose. I've worked for many, many years with the mayor of San Jose and that police department, and my prayers and my thoughts are with all those families that have been affected,"" Harris said. ""The epidemic of gun violence in America must end. Congress must act."" Wednesday’s shooting in San Jose is the latest in a series of mass shooting incidents across the nation. On April 16, 19-year-old Brandon Hole opened fire at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, killing eight people before taking his own life. He was placed on immediate mental health temporary hold and had his shotgun seized from his residence before the shooting. On March 22, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa opened fire at King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, with an AR-15 style assault rifle. He killed 10 people, including Boulder police officer Eric Talley, before he was arrested. He is now charged with 115 counts.

Authorities say a gunman opened fire at the Valley Transportation Authority building during a shift change on Wednesday morning, killing eight and injuring several others; the shooter died by suicide.

154,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/i-just-ran-for-my-life-nine-dead-in-mass-shooting-at-san-jose-vta-yard/,"Trending: A Valley Transportation Authority worker known for a hot temper and nursing grievances opened fire on his coworkers at a light rail facility in San Jose on Wednesday, killing eight before turning the gun on himself as authorities closed in. Law enforcement sources identified Samuel James Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA maintenance worker, as the gunman in the deadliest mass shooting in the Bay Area in nearly three decades. Another victim was in critical condition at Valley Medical Center on Wednesday afternoon, and others were wounded as well. The early morning tragedy, the 15th massacre in the U.S. this year, drew pained reactions from Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Joe Biden and renewed national calls for tightened gun control laws that have been stymied after earlier incidents. Bomb squads spent much of the day methodically combing the sprawling VTA Guadalupe Yard on West Younger Avenue searching for explosives. They did the same at a South San Jose home where records show Cassidy lived and where a two-alarm fire broke out around the time of the shooting. Law enforcement officials revealed few details Wednesday about what happened during the shooting, which began around 6:30 a.m., including whether Cassidy specifically targeted his victims and what kind of weapon he used. Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office identified the dead as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Witnesses described hearing a gunman fire shots as he moved through the complex and watching as terrified colleagues scattered for safety. The yard, which houses maintenance shops and a control center, is at its busiest in the early morning hours as light rail service begins. “I was running so fast, I just ran for my life,” said Rochelle Hawkins, a VTA mechanic. “I would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.” Another worker, who did not want to be identified, said, “The whole crew is gone. The whole shift is gone.” A grimly familiar process unfolded from there. Scores of VTA workers who survived were taken to a nearby county administration building to be reunited with loved ones, some of whom would learn that their family members had been killed. Others anxiously waited for news after countless phone calls to friends and loved ones went unanswered. Law enforcement leaders praised the sheriff’s deputies and police officers who ran into the VTA complex while the shooting was underway and, authorities said, helped limit the death toll. Fundraisers began for the victims and their loved ones. And public officials offered condolences as they decried the latest in a pandemic of mass gun violence in this country. “There is a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday afternoon. “It begs the damn question: What the hell is going on in the United States of America?” In a written statement, President Joe Biden reflected upon “the solemn duty yet again of ordering the flag to be lowered at half-staff” after a mass shooting. “Enough,” Biden said. “Once again, I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Gunfire broke out as day began The Guadalupe Yard is a sprawling North San Jose facility with multiple industrial buildings, rows of train tracks and dozens of light rail vehicles that sits just across Interstate 880 from Mineta International Airport. The complex is a block from the headquarters of the Santa Clara County Sheriff. Footage from a neighbor’s security camera showed Cassidy left his home at 5:39 a.m. Wednesday, dressed in a work jumpsuit and carrying a large black duffel bag that he put on the passenger seat of his white Ford F-150 pickup truck. The first 9-1-1 calls about the shooting came in at 6:34 a.m. Authorities have not disclosed what Cassidy, who worked as a substation maintainer and mechanic, was doing in the moments that led up to the shooting, what if any motive he may have had or where in the complex shots were fired. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith confirmed at a press conference that people were shot in two buildings. First responders in radio transmissions from the scene reported they found some victims in the complex’s Building B, near the western end of the yard. Another VTA employee, who declined to be identified, said he was working in Building A, the three-story building that is the largest in the facility, when he heard the sound of gunfire coming from outside and saw workers scattering across the yard. Moments later, he heard at least one gunshot that sounded like it was coming from inside his building. Law enforcement officers could hear gunfire as they arrived at the scene, according to radio transmissions, and dispatchers reported the gunman was believed to be on the third floor of a building. Smith said deputies did not fire their weapons. “When the suspect knew that law enforcement was there, he took his own life,” Smith said. About 100 VTA workers were escorted after the shooting to an auditorium in the nearby county administration building. Family members endured hours-long waits to find out whether their loved ones were safe. Inside the auditorium, screams and wailing broke out. “I just witnessed someone’s mom who just found out her son died,” a VTA worker said. “It was ugly.” Family members said that Taptejdeep Singh, 36, a light rail operator married with two small children, was gunned down in a stairwell. Coworkers told them that Singh had left the safety of an office where others were hunkered down to help others escape. “We are in very deep grief,” said his uncle, Sakhwant Dhillon. “He told people, ‘Be careful, hide.’ He was running around the building to save others’ lives.” As federal and local authorities investigated the shooting scene, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office said bomb-sniffing dogs alerted them to the possibility of explosives, prompting a room-to-room search of the light rail yard. The scene was later declared safe. Two minutes after the shooting began, authorities also received a report from a passerby of a fire at a home that belongs to Cassidy on Angmar Court, about 8 miles from the VTA yard. Authorities, who believe the fire started before the shooting, did not disclose its cause, but bomb squad technicians were at the scene of the fire throughout the day as well. Another fire, in an industrial area on Smith Avenue between Cassidy’s home and the VTA yard, was also reported around 6:30 a.m. It was unclear if the fire had any connection to the shooting or to the Angmar Court blaze. Shooter left troubled trail but didn’t trigger ‘red flag’ laws Cassidy had a mercurial temper and complained about his assignments at work, according to his former wife, Cecilia Nelms, of Santa Cruz, who was married to him for 10 years but hasn’t seen him in 13. “He had two sides,” Nelms said Wednesday. “When he was in a good mood, he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad.” In 2009, Cassidy filed for a domestic violence restraining order against another woman, his ex-girlfriend, alleging harassment. She in turn filed a response accusing him of sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol abuse. California has a “red flag” law that lets family members and law enforcement ask a judge to temporarily confiscate guns from a potentially dangerous person who could pose a threat to others. Legislation by Assemblyman Phil Ting, D-San Francisco, expanded the “gun violence restraining order” law in September to allow employers and coworkers also to make such requests. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Wednesday he does not believe the law was used in regard to the VTA shooter. Authorities did not say how Cassidy acquired the gun he used in the shooting or whether it was purchased legally. The massacre ranks among the Bay Area’s deadliest, leaving as many dead as the July 1993 shooting at a 101 California Street law firm in San Francisco by a disgruntled client who also took his own life — a horror that inspired a since-expired federal ban on military style firearms. It is also the third mass shooting in Santa Clara County since 2019: A man killed four people before taking his own life at a San Jose home in June of that year, and a man fatally shot three people at the Gilroy Garlic Festival the following August before killing himself. Shooting targeted essential workers With the light rail yard now the scene of the shooting investigation, VTA leaders suspended service on the system at noon Wednesday, replacing its trains with bus service. Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the authority’s board, said the three-line light rail system would likely remain out of service “for several days.” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo was among those who noted the shooting targeted essential transit workers who had continued to do their jobs in person through last year’s pandemic lockdowns, despite the risk to themselves. Two VTA workers died from COVID-19 over the past year. Related Articles

156,https://uproxx.com/viral/fox-news-pat-brosnan-shootings-vaccines/,"When they cover mass shootings, Fox News tends to downplay them, perhaps out of fear that the public may turn on one of the main reasons they happen so often: our nation’s plentiful and easily obtained number of guns. But on Wednesday they leaned hard into the latest tragedy, which one guest attempted — and not very well — to spin into a damning critique on…pandemic lockdowns and vaccinations. This seems like a weird takeaway from the San Jose mass shooting. Retired NYPD detective Pat Brosnan on Fox News: ""Once covid starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations. You can be sure they probably got vaccinated."" pic.twitter.com/XfZL4JgsBW — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) May 26, 2021  That morning, a public transit worker in San Jose opened fire in a rail yard, killing eight others and then himself. The shooter was later identified as one Sam Cassidy, an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and though motives, as of this writing, remain unknown, his ex-wife told a CNN affiliate that he was known to speak angrily about his co-workers and that he resented his work. Hours after the shooting, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner talked over the phone with retired NYPD officer Pat Brosnan, who had his own unique take on the shooting, and on shootings during the pandemic in general. For one thing, he didn’t blame the overabundance of firearms. He blamed what he saw as a lax handling of law enforcement. “I think there would be more nuanced response in terms of opening a shooting – an active shooting – right next door to where there’s a load of armed professional shooters under law enforcement,” Brosnan told Faulkner. “But the rules have changed, you know? Crimes are no longer illegal. There’s no longer enforcement of lots of laws and there’s an empowerment of these active shooters.” He then had a grim prediction, based on a questionable theory: that shootings decreased during the pandemic. And you know, Harris, this is a time that I wish I was wrong with my prediction, which I mention to anybody who’d listen, that once Covid starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations. You can be sure they probably got vaccinated. They were just scared to come out. And they’re coming back, and you see the numbers don’t lie. The shootings are up dramatically – skyrocketing, actually – on active shootings throughout the United States as we’ve come through this pandemic. It’s really terrifying stuff. There’s no hard evidence to support any of this, but maybe you don’t need evidence when you’re suggesting that mass shooters are just being “cowardly” because…they’re afraid of contracting a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease? And they wouldn’t have been cowards had they gone outside and shot a bunch of people and then themselves? The logic fogs one’s mind. But then, Brosnan isn’t just any ordinary retired cop. He’s a retired cop who shot two Latino men in the back as they laid face-down on a floor, prompting a million dollar lawsuit, though he went unpunished and still collects pension. Brosnan was a cop who murdered a Latino teen & another young Latino in 1995 by shooting them in the back as they lay face-down on the floor. NYC paid a $1+M settlement in a civil suit, but neither cop was punished. Brosnan still receives his pension.https://t.co/XMn7vDNfHW — Mark Hughes (@markhughesfilms) May 26, 2021  He also apparently still goes on Fox News spreading nonsensical theories about gun violence.

A gunman opened fire at a light rail yard Wednesday, killing eight people and himself in the latest shooting rampage to rock the nation in recent weeks. Police spokesman Russell Davis said the gunman was an employee at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub, and other employees were among the victims. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said the gunman took his own life. Craig Fair, the FBI special agent in charge, said the crime scene was ""fairly sizable"" and is ""going to take a while to process."" The suspect was identified as Samuel Cassidy, 57, who had been licensed with the Bureau of Automotive Repair as a smog check repair technician since 2003. ""These folks were heroes during COVID-19. The buses never stopped running. The VTA didn’t stop running. They just kept at work, and now we’re really calling on them to be heroes a second time — to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy,"" County Supervisor Cindy Chavez said. The incident marks Santa Clara County's second mass shooting in less than two years. In 2019, a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, killing three people and wounding 17. Gov. Gavin Newsom lamented the country's latest mass shooting. ""What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us?"" Newsom said at a press conference, his voice cracking at times. ""When are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively?"" He added, ""Wake up to this reality and take a little damn responsibility, all of us. ... Move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments, but the aftermath of these moments."" There have been 15 mass killings in 2021, each with at least four fatal victims, according to an Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University database. All cases were shootings and claimed a total of 86 lives. The reward fund for tips leading to an arrest in the fatal shooting of a 6-year-old boy in an apparent road rage incident last week has surged to at least $200,000. At a Tuesday meeting, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved the allocation of $100,000 for a reward fund to help identify the shooter, Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley confirmed to USA Today. ""Let’s get justice for his family and our devastated community,"" Don Wagner, another county supervisor, tweeted along with his announcement of the board's approval. Aiden Leos, was sitting in the backseat of his mother's car as she drove him to kindergarten when another driver shot him, authorities said. Aiden was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The $50,000 from Wagner's office matches a $50,000 reward offered by the boy's family, according to the tweet. Foley also pledged $50,000, according to a Tuesday statement, and that total climbed to $200,000 after an anonymous donation announced at a Tuesday vigil for Aiden. And it's possible the fund has reached $250,000. ABC7 on Wednesday reported that a group of Orange County businessmen had offered another $50,000. It's been a year since the murder of George Floyd, and during that time police reform in Los Angeles has been a major topic for the first time since the Rodney King beating in 1991. But what sort of changes have been implemented? LAist reports that ""reformers have won major victories at the ballot box, cuts to the LAPD budget and new initiatives to remove the police from traffic stops and mental health calls."" However, the report says the movement’s overall progress has been uneven, saying there has been some change, but no transformation. One of the reformers’ biggest challenges over the past year has been the dramatic increase in shootings and homicides, which both LAPD Chief Michel Moore and Sheriff Alex Villanueva suggest are the results of their departments' budget cuts. “It’s real simple,” Villanueva said recently. “You’ve got more crime, more crooks, and less cops. What could go wrong?”  Read the full article here. President Joe Biden is expected to announce he is nominating former senior State Department official Nicholas Burns to serve as his ambassador to China and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to be his ambassador to India, according to a person familiar with the matter. With the selections, Biden is turning to a seasoned diplomat and a longtime political ally to serve in two of the country’s highest-profile diplomatic postings. It was not clear when either nomination would be announced, according to the person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House declined to comment on either Burns or Garcetti and noted that “no one is final until they’re announced."" Garcetti, if confirmed, would be dispatched to India as it has been overwhelmed by a surge in coronavirus infections and deaths. India’s death toll is the third-highest reported in the world after the U.S. and Brazil, and true numbers are thought to be significantly greater. Alex Comisar, a spokesperson in Garcetti’s mayoral office, declined to comment. White sharks, commonly referred to as ""great"" white sharks, are one of nature's apex predators. However, maintaining California’s white shark population has been a concern for decades. Since 1994, the sharp-toothed creatures have been a protected species. In 2011, California banned shark finning in state waters. Thanks to tireless work by local researchers, the Central Coast population seems to be thriving. Recently, Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center put out a press release saying that the white shark population off California’s Central Coast is small but healthy. Researchers spent eight years monitoring the population at Año Nuevo Island north of Santa Cruz, the Farallon Islands off of San Francisco, and Tomales Bay north, the area commonly known as the ""red triangle."" What researchers found was a stable population of sharks. Subadult sharks showed no increase in population, nor did the female adult white sharks. But male adult white sharks showed a slight increase in population over time, according to said Paul Kanive, a graduate student involved in the project. Read more about the study here. If you've never heard of an ostatuak, a Basque boarding house, you're not alone. But for more than 100 years, these establishments populated the American West, with as many as 30 situated in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Today, only one — Centro Basco in Chino — remains in Southern California. And Michel Bordagary is its lone tenant. The 83-year-old moved there in 1966, with only the clothes on his back and whatever belongings he could carry. These days, the Centro's boarding rooms, aside from the one Bordagary calls home, remain empty. And the facility operates as a restaurant and cultural institution. But there's a whole lot that happened between 1940, when the Centro opened its doors, and now. Read more about this fascinating bit of history at LAist. And lastly, on this day in history: John Wayne was born. Identified by public polls as one of the most popular film actors of all time, Wayne, who came to epitomize the American West, entered the world on this day in 1907. The star of such classic films as ""Stagecoach,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and ""True Grit,"" for which he won an Academy Award, Wayne died of cancer in Los Angeles in 1979.

But first of all, the shooting. From NBC News: A public transit employee opened fire on co-workers at a Northern California rail yard on Wednesday, killing more than a half-dozen people before taking his own life, authorities said. Calls of shots fired came about 6:34 a.m. PT near 100 W. Younger Ave. in downtown San Jose, drawing a large law enforcement response, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office said. ""There are multiple injuries and multiple fatalities in this case,"" sheriff's Deputy Russell Davis told reporters at the scene. “The suspect is confirmed deceased."" I know it’s been a long time since the pandemic forced us all into our little Saddam Hussein spiderholes, and I know my memory isn’t what is used to be, but I seem to recall these sorts of things happening fairly frequently before COVID-19. I remember that time a guy killed 59 people and injured around 500 others from his Las Vegas hotel room during the elysian law-and-order reign of Donald J. Trump, and gun violence has been on the rise for over a year. But sure, let’s give the mass shooter the benefit of the doubt and assume he saw this namby-pamby Biden regime coming and wanted to beat the rush. That’s the only kind of explanation these people seem willing to accept. Fox News’ Harris Faulkner invited retired New York Police detective Pat Brosnan, a regular Fox guest who previously tied a rise in crime in Minneapolis to police reform efforts, on her show this morning, and boy did he sound like an ass. Behold! This seems like a weird takeaway from the San Jose mass shooting.Retired NYPD detective Pat Brosnan on Fox News: ""Once covid starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations. You can be sure they probably got vaccinated."" pic.twitter.com/XfZL4JgsBW Transcript! BROSNAN: In a rational world where there’s adherence to the rule of law and respect for law enforcement, say pre-the summer of love of 2020, I think there would be more nuanced response in terms of opening a shooting, an active shooting, right next door to where there’s a load of armed professional shooters under law enforcement. But the rules have changed. You know, crimes are no longer illegal, there’s no longer an enforcement of lots of laws, and there’s an empowerment of these active shooters. And you know, Harris, this is a time that I wish I was wrong with my prediction, which I mentioned to anybody who would listen, that once COVID starts to lift, these cowardly shooters will come out exactly in tandem with the number of vaccinations. You can be sure they probably got vaccinated. They were just scared to come out, and they’re coming back, and you see the numbers don’t lie. The shootings are up dramatically, skyrocketing, actually, on active shootings throughout the United States as we come through this pandemic. It’s really terrifying stuff. I’m sure the grieving families are rushing to blame the vaccines for this horrible loss. After all, what’s that old NRA saying? Guns don’t kill people, people who have been vaccinated kill people?

I don’t know about you, but in my experience, people who opt to take the vaccine do so in order to safely return to their favorite activities—and in no such instance did any of those activities include mass murder. The worst thing I’ve heard is that someone wanted to go the Wisconsin State Fair this year to see Billy Idol, who is looking more like Michael Myers’ Halloween mask by the day. According to The Daily Beast’s Justin Baragona, Faulkner didn’t follow up on Brosnan’s risible claim about the vaccinated crawling out of their giant basement larval husks to rain holy terror down on the pure-hearted vaccine resistors among us … but did you really expect her to? You can say any fool thing on Fox News these days and as long as it contributes to the prevailing MAGA narrative, you’ll never be challenged on it. But maybe she could have asked why someone who was fixing to commit suicide by cop would bother to protect themselves against COVID-19. Or why they’d want to help us reach our goal of herd immunity while simultaneously seeking to cull that same herd. In fact, a mass shooter taking out a few fellow citizens has a lot more in common with an anti-vaxxer who doesn’t give a shit about spreading disease and death than with people who are doing all they can to end a devastating pandemic. But hey, the longer you listen to nonsense, the more it will start to sound rational. Cult leaders have always known this—and this is one doozy of a cult we’re dealing with.  It made comedian Sarah Silverman say “THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT” and prompted author Stephen King to shout “Pulitzer Prize!!!” (on Twitter, that is). What is it?

Just 12 hours after the Bay Area was rocked by the largest mass casualty shooting here in nearly three decades, community organizers and religious leaders gathered in downtown San Jose’s St. James Park to memorialize the lives lost, offer prayers for the victims’ families and friends and advocate for stronger gun control. “My heart mourns for those who were lost today — innocent men and women — and the families now without mothers and fathers who have to make sense of this mess, to make sense of insanity, to make sense of senseless violence,” said the Rev. Ray Montgomery, executive director of nonprofit People Acting in Community Together, or PACT. The gathering, which PACT organized, was one of two evening vigils hastily organized Wednesday after that morning’s mass shooting at a VTA rail yard building in San Jose, leaving 10 people dead, including the gunman. The civil rights group Human Empowerment (through) Radical Optimism, also known as HERO Tent, held another vigil in front of City Hall at the same time. San Jose city leaders meanwhile have planned an event to honor the shooting victims at 6 p.m. Thursday night, also in front of City Hall. The religious leaders who gathered Wednesday evening in St. James Park said they felt it was their obligation to show their support for the victims — whose names the county released later in the evening — and their loved ones and to call on elected officials to enact stricter measures to prevent such shootings in the future. “We need to recognize that we’re already in need of healing,” Montgomery said. “People are hurting right now, either directly or indirectly, and then when you encounter something as atrocious as this, how do you respond except that we must show up for people who can’t show up.” Related Articles

His home was ablaze during the attack. This briefing has ended. Follow the latest San Jose shooting updates. The nine victims were named by authorities. Gov. Gavin Newsom asks: ‘What the hell is wrong with us?’ ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. People who knew the suspect say he had a hostile personality. The gunman’s home was ablaze during the attack. A transit worker opened fire at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., early Wednesday, killing nine people, many of them fellow employees, according to the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which reported that the gunman was also dead. California law enforcement officials identified the gunman as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade and whose suburban home was in flames as the shooting started. The attack — which occurred as dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were preparing for the start of the day’s service — spread turmoil through the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose, the nation’s 10th-largest city and the heart of Silicon Valley. Buildings were evacuated, and light rail service was gradually shut down as bomb squad teams scoured the area for explosives. Employees who had been working the busy morning shift were led to a separate building, where family members awaited. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California met with some of them. In an afternoon news conference, he praised sheriff’s deputies for their response to the shooting and lamented yet another American tragedy. “What the hell is wrong with us,” he said, “and when are we going to come to grips with this?” In a statement, President Biden urged Congress to take action on gun violence and said, “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. There are children, parents, and spouses who are waiting to hear whether someone they love is ever going to come home. There are union brothers and sisters — good, honest, hardworking people — who are mourning their own.” The medical examiner’s office in Santa Clara County identified the victims on Wednesday night as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Late Wednesday night, the medical examiner announced the death of a ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, who died at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. James Kostmayer, a San Jose County employee who works in the building where families were waiting to hear word about their loved ones, said the scene inside was “heartbreaking.” “You could hear the screams and cries of the families” from the elevator, he said, adding that he heard “a mother screaming, ‘My son, my son.’” Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said that police officers did not exchange gunfire with the gunman, and that they believed he had killed himself. He also said they had no indication about a possible motive. In an interview, Connie Wang, 58, a former girlfriend of the suspect, said she had not seen or spoken to him in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable.” Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose said those who had known the suspect as a co-worker for years also “expressed generalized concerns about his mental health.” “This is a horrific day for our city,” Mr. Liccardo told reporters. “And it’s a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the authority’s board, noted that the authority’s work force of some 2,100 employees had been essential during the coronavirus pandemic, risking their health to provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of the Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice shaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” The violence was first reported at 6:34 a.m. in a corner of a large complex of municipal buildings. Officers were dispatched from the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, which is headquartered next door. Neil Vigdor contributed reporting. — Thomas Fuller, Christine Hauser, Kellen Browning and Shawn Hubler Gov. Gavin Newsom of California condemned the “rinse and repeat” cycle of mass shootings in America as he spoke to reporters on Wednesday about the killing of nine people at a rail yard in San Jose. There have been 68 mass shootings in the United States in the past two months, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are injured or killed. “It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Mr. Newsom said. “What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?” Mr. Newsom implored lawmakers to take action, and told all Americans to “take a little damn responsibility, all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, and move beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark not just these moments but the aftermath of these moments.” The number of mass shootings declined during much of the coronavirus pandemic, but they have become more frequent since March, when a gunman killed eight people at spas in the Atlanta area. Mr. Newsom called mass shootings a “pre-existing condition” that had once again “reared its ugly head.” The shooting in San Jose is believed to be the deadliest in the Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman used three semiautomatic pistols to kill eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco. — Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright The man identified by California law enforcement officials as the gunman in a mass shooting at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday lived alone and had a hostile personality, according to interviews with a neighbor and an ex-girlfriend, as well as a review of court records. The gunman, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, lived southeast of downtown San Jose, in a suburban neighborhood of cul-de-sacs and palm trees, public records show. Doug Suh, a real estate agent who lived across the street, described Mr. Cassidy, who authorities say appeared to have killed himself, as someone with a short temper. “I was afraid of him,” Mr. Suh said. “My wife was scared of him, too.” “He lived alone,” Mr. Suh said. “I never saw any friends or family. I never saw anyone else going into the house.” Mr. Suh recalled Mr. Cassidy once lashing out at him when Mr. Suh turned his car around in Mr. Cassidy’s driveway. “He yelled, ‘Do not come onto my driveway.’” Family court records show that Mr. Cassidy was married for 10 years before divorcing in 2004. The couple had no children. In 2009, Mr. Cassidy sought a restraining order against his former girlfriend, Jingkun Wang, known as Connie. In court filings, he accused her of vandalizing his roommate’s car, calling at late hours of the night, hurling insults and suggesting she had him under surveillance. Ms. Wang countered that Mr. Cassidy, whom she had dated for a year, had “major mood swings due to bipolar disorder” which were exacerbated when he consumed large quantities of alcohol. She also accused him of forcing himself on her sexually. Their relationship failed when he told her around February 2009 that a female houseguest had moved in, and that she should no longer come visit. She denied vandalizing any vehicles, and accused him of stealing items from restaurants and employers, and failing to return her television and computer printer. “He has manipulated me in many ways which are apparent to my friends and family,” she said. The court ordered Ms. Wang to stay at least 300 yards from him, his parents and his new girlfriend for three years. In a phone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Wang, now 58, said she had not spoken to Mr. Cassidy in 12 years, but described him as someone who was “not mentally stable,” who would be loving one moment and mean the next. She also described his drinking as excessive. They met on Match.com, Ms. Wang said. Two months into their relationship, he told her to pick a diamond ring and he would buy it, she recalled. She declined. After they broke up, Mr. Cassidy showed up at her apartment complex one day, Ms. Wang said. A neighbor let him in and he took her brand-new Toyota Camry, for which he had a key, without permission. He returned it damaged from what he told her was an accident, she said. — Patricia Mazzei, Frances Robles and Thomas Fuller Andy and Alice Abad were in their kitchen Wednesday morning in southeastern San Jose when they saw a funnel of smoke pouring out of a neighbor’s home, a one-story gray house with white trim and a patchy lawn. Mr. Abad called 911 and was told that firefighters were already on the way. “The flames were above the rooftop,” Mr. Abad said. He took a picture of the house with his cellphone and headed out with his wife to a doctor’s appointment. When he returned home at noon, the neighborhood was swarming with fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. “What’s going on here?” Mr. Abad said as he stepped out of his car in his driveway. The mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, described a “strange connection” between the fire in the house and the attack on a rail yard near downtown that left nine people dead, including the gunman. The site of the shooting is eight miles away from the home, a 10- or 15-minute drive. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights of emergency vehicles that penetrated into the cul-de-sacs of what is described by residents as a quiet suburban neighborhood populated largely by Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. (The neighborhood is near Evergreen, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Members of the bomb squad walked past citrus and palm trees to enter the home as other law enforcement officers carried shovels and other garden implements into the property. The home on Wednesday afternoon was largely intact, but the crown of the roof was darkened by fire. — Thomas Fuller Families of Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority employees were directed to wait for news at a county building close to the rail yard. Jazmin Diaz arrived to find out if her brother, Max, who works for the authority, was OK. He doesn’t work at the part of the rail yard where the shooting occurred, she said, but had not answered his phone all morning. “I hope he’s good,” she said, pausing to take a phone call from a family member. “We believe that God protected him.” One man, who would not provide his name, arrived at the county building with his grandfather. He was hoping for news of his uncle, a light rail operator who he has not heard from all morning. “I never thought something like this would really happen,” the man said, before entering the building. “He has two little kids — that’s all I can think about right now.” Brandi Childress, a spokeswoman for the V.T.A., said she was informed at 6:45 a.m. local time that there was an “active shooter event.” Employees were on the job at that time, she said. “It is where we have dispatchers and maintenance,” she said. “They get up early and they are there. That is why the focus is on containing and evacuating employees. It is where we store and maintain all of our trains.” At about 1 p.m., at least 10 family groups emerged from the side of the county building, where Gov. Gavin Newsom of California stood in the doorway. Some, including a pair of women with their arms wrapped around a third woman, were escorted by security officers into a waiting bus. Loirena Ruico, who drove the bus to the nearby American Red Cross building, said the ride was somber. “It’s scary, it’s so tense — everyone’s crying,” she said. Outside the Red Cross center, Christina Gonzalez choked back tears as she waited for news of her cousin Michael Rudometkin. She said she left work and rushed to the center after her brother told her that Mr. Rudometkin was among the people who were shot. She said she had yet to learn anything about her cousin’s condition or where he was. “I’m just waiting and praying, and hoping he’s OK,” Ms. Gonzalez said. She said Mr. Rudometkin, who lives in Santa Cruz, was at a union meeting in the morning. “Very proud, loved his job and just always stood up for everyone’s rights,” she said of her cousin. “He is just a very good person, so we’re really hoping this isn’t the place to tell us the bad news.” By Wednesday evening, the county medical examiner’s office had released the names of the victims, including Mr. Rudometkin, 40. — Kellen Browning As dispatchers and maintenance workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail yard were preparing for the start of the day’s service, gunshots threw the sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose into turmoil. Glenn Hendricks, the authority chairman, called the incident “a horrible tragedy” for its work force of some 2,100 mostly unionized employees, who provide bus, rail and paratransit service for commuters in much of Silicon Valley. “V.T.A. is a family,” Mr. Hendricks said, his voice quaking. “Everyone in the organization knows everyone.” Transit service continued for several hours after the shooting without disruption, even as the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office — which is headquartered next door to the rail yard as part of a sprawling municipal complex near downtown San Jose — dispatched deputies to the scene of the shooting in a maintenance yard. “As I drove here,” Mr. Hendricks said, citing the dedication of the authority employees, “I saw buses on the road.” But service on the light-rail system’s three lines was later shut down as the maintenance facility became the scene of an active investigation. Mr. Hendricks said extra buses would be dispatched to cover for the canceled trains. He added that grief counseling would be made available to workers, including the 100 or so who were on the scene when the shooting erupted. Sgt. Russell Davis, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said several of the people who were killed were V.T.A. employees, as was the gunman. “This is a horrific day for our city,” said the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, who also serves on the V.T.A. board. “And a tragic day for the V.T.A. family.” — Shawn Hubler The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-26 21:57:02,People who knew the suspect say he had a hostile personality.,,1,http://nytimes.com

164,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/here-are-the-eight-victims-of-the-san-jose-vta-shooting/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — They were tinkerers, chefs and golfers, commuting from as far as Tracy and Gilroy for their pre-dawn jobs at the Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail yard, performing maintenance or keeping light rail running in the dark. The nine men — beloved sons, fathers, husbands and grandfathers — were killed Wednesday in the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. Their stories vary, their ages range from 29 to 63 and their hometowns stretch from Iran and the Philippines to Santa Cruz County. On Thursday, their friends and loved ones shared their feelings of loss, shock and mourning. “It’s devastating. We all know at some point we’re going to go,” Raul Peralez, a San Jose councilman and childhood friend of one of the victims, said. “But to happen in this manner, nobody expects this and it’s so traumatic and violent it’s hard to comprehend.” These are the stories those left behind shared. Taptej Singh The father of a 3-year-old son and a 1-year-old daughter, Singh died while working to save the lives of his coworkers, relatives and VTA employees said. “We are in very deep grief,” said his uncle, Sakhwant Dhillon. “He told people, ‘Be careful, hide.’ He was running around the building to save others’ lives.” Family members said they were told by Singh’s coworkers that the 36-year-old left the safety of an office — where others were hunkered down — to help colleagues escape. He was killed in a stairwell. Singh was born in India and was raising his family in Union City. He’d worked for VTA for 14 years and was a light rail operator, just like his brother-in-law P.J. Bath. “He was always helpful to everyone and caring,” Bath said. Michael Joseph Rudometkin Rudometkin, known as Mike, was the neighbor you’d call for help trimming trees, friends said, a tinkerer with a love of fixing cars and motorcycles who will be remembered for the lip-sync battle parties he’d throw with his wife Gloria. “He was a friend to everybody. We were trying to think of who it was that Mike didn’t get along with, and there was nobody,” said Peralez, who’d been friends with Rudometkin since 7th grade. An overhead line worker and former mechanic, Rudometkin, 40, had been with VTA since 2013. He and Peralez were receivers and defensive ends for the Cupertino High School football team, and the pair were planning a golf-day reunion with Peralez’s father. Rudometkin’s Santa Cruz neighbor Donna Giubbini collapsed onto her doorstep when she learned he was one of the victims. “This was a good, good man,” Giubbini, 60, said through tears. She has been backyard neighbors with Rudometkin for 10 years. “He just cared about people. He went out of his way to be kind, and just the best neighbor you could ever have. I loved him.He loved tinkering, Peralez said, rebuilding bikes or working on the cars of friends. But he also enjoyed throwing parties with Gloria, who would choose a theme, such as lip-synch battles, Peralez recalled. “They loved hosting, they loved socializing,” he said. Alex Ward Fritch When Fritch was asked early last year what made the perfect tiki bar, his answer was simple: escape. “You should feel like you’re stepping into a different world, leaving your day to day behind,” he told the website Tiki with Ray. The 49-year-old substation manager was known in part for his involvement in the Bay Area’s tiki bar community, which started when he and his wife, Terra, built their own getaway in an enclosed back patio of their San Jose home so they could have cocktail parties. “He was the life of the party. Always there with a friendly quip, a kind word, or to make a funny face when you’re taking a selfie,” Kevin Crossman wrote on his blog about tiki bars and Mai Tais. “I had finally found a friend to nerd out with on this rum and cocktail stuff. Now he’s gone.” A GoFundMe page organized by Terra called Alex “an optimistic man, passionate man, a dreamer who loved his family with all his heart.” She told KTVU he had grown up in Ben Lomond, and that the father of three who died at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center was the family’s sole financial provider. She told the TV station nurses made room for her on Alex’s hospital bed so she could say goodbye. “He was the love of my life,” she told KTVU. Abdolvahab Alaghmandan Alaghmandan, known to his friends and family as Abdi, and his family moved to the U.S. from Iran in 1995 and lived in Castro Valley. His son, Soheil, said in a brief interview Thursday that Alaghmandan was a father of two, a husband, and dedicated to his job at the VTA. “He worked overtime, he worked through the entire pandemic,” Soheil said of his father, speaking softly. “He’s a tinkerer. He can fix anything.” A substation maintainer, the 63-year-old had been with VTA for 20 years. “He’s a gentle soul who loves everyone,” Soheil said. Adrian Balleza The 29-year-old light rail operator had been with VTA since 2014 when he started as a bus operator trainee. At a Thursday morning news conference, Guadalupe Yard superintendent Naunihal Singh called Balleza “a gem of a person,” noting that he, like Singh, was killed while helping others get to safety Wednesday morning. “It shows the character of these guys,” Naunihal Singh said, “how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation.” Balleza was married with a young son, according to public records and his social media presence, and lived in the South Bay. Reached by phone Thursday, his father said he was too upset to talk. Lars Kepler Lane Lane, a lineman at VTA for two decades, was the person you’d call if you were worried the trains wouldn’t run after a San Francisco 49ers game, loved ones said, or if you needed a gourmet meal whipped up. “He was such an amazing man. He could fix anything, he could cook anything. He is so loved,” Lane’s sister-in-law, Sonja Gilchrist, said Thursday outside Lane’s home in South San Jose. Lane, 63, and his wife, Vicki Jo, were married for 22 years, Gilchrist said. They were introduced by Vicki’s daughter after Vicki’s first husband died of brain cancer about 25 years ago, Gilchrist said. “Vicki’s broken,” Gilchrist said of her sister. “Lars was the love of her life. She’s pretty devastated.” Lane would get called in for overtime to work major incidents or big events, Gilchrist said, and would wait out front of the 49ers stadium during games in case anything went wrong. But the man known to his loved ones as Kep was also an “amazing chef.” “Everything was plated fancy like a restaurant,” Gilchrist said. “He was the sauce king.” Lane was going to take the train to Sacramento after work Saturday to celebrate his 64th birthday with his family. He was a loving stepfather to Vicki’s daughter, and he had three sons of his own, as well as four grandchildren, Gilchrist said. “This was so unexpected and so tragic. Kep, he was the nicest man,” she said. “There was no reason for anyone to hurt him.” Paul Delacruz Megia While Megia’s workdays were spent overseeing colleagues, his free time was all about adventure. The 42-year-old assistant superintendent in service management had been at VTA since 2002, previously working as a bus and light rail operator before becoming a supervisor. He spent weekends fishing or skiing in Tahoe, and teaching his kids to wakeboard, said his father, Leonard Megia, 68. Going down the slopes, Paul was always in the front of the family pack, with his kids and father taking up the rear. Growing up in Redwood City after the family emigrated from the Philippines, he was a sharp kid who graduated with a degree in business administration from CSU Hayward, his father said. He was also a practical joker, especially with his children. “He liked to get them by surprise,” his dad said, starting to giggle as he recalled. “He would hide behind doors to jump out at people.” Megia usually worked from home Wednesdays, his father said, but was called in unexpectedly the morning of the shooting. Father and son live just four doors apart from one another in the Mountain House area near Tracy. Leonard Megia first learned of the shooting on television, after Paul failed to return his usual 7 a.m. phone call. It would be hours before the fire department confirmed to the family that Paul was among those killed, but Leonard Megia said he felt it in his gut. “It’s the worst thing that could ever happen to you,” he said. Jose Dejesus Hernandez III The 35-year-old substation maintainer was a Fremont native who started working as a VTA mechanic in 2012. Hernandez’ sister, Tanya, described her brother as an intelligent and hard-working man who had a passion for working on cars and other vehicles. “He knew how to take engines apart, put them back together and make everything faster,” she said. “He just had this genius mind.” Tanya said her brother had dreams of leaving the VTA and starting his own auto repair business. “He didn’t ever complain, but I know he wanted to work on cars because he was so good at it,” she said. Timothy Michael Romo The 49-year-old overhead line worker has been with the agency for more than 20 years. Romo was married to his wife, Annette, and had three children, Audrey, Scott and Tristan. Romo’s daughter, Audrey, said her dad was the “smartest and funniest” man she knew. “He was always the life of the party and all of my friends loved being around him,” she said. “I’m going to miss him everyday, but I know that I have a great support system and I have a woeful family and they’re always going to be there to get me through this.” His son Scott said his dad was his idol and hero. “He was my superman and I’ll never not miss him,” he said. A former neighbor described him as “kind and helpful” on a GoFundMe associated with Romo. “The great and happy memories made with you and your family while growing up next door will remain in my heart forever,” she added. Raised in Greenfield, a small coastal area in Monterey County, he was the son of a former mayor and police chief, Salinas-based KSBW said. Romo was most recently living in Tracy, records show.

The 49-year-old substation manager was known in part for his involvement in the Bay Area’s tiki bar community, which started when he and his wife, Terra, built their own getaway in an enclosed back patio of their San Jose home so they could have cocktail parties. “He was the life of the party. Always there with a friendly quip, a kind word, or to make a funny face when you’re taking a selfie,” Kevin Crossman wrote on his blog about tiki bars and Mai Tais. “I had finally found a friend to nerd out with on this rum and cocktail stuff. Now he’s gone.” A GoFundMe page organized by Terra called Alex “an optimistic man, passionate man, a dreamer who loved his family with all his heart.” She told KTVU he had grown up in Ben Lomond, and that the father of three who died at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center was the family’s sole financial provider. She told the TV station nurses made room for her on Alex’s hospital bed so she could say goodbye. “He was the love of my life,” she told KTVU. Abdolvahab Alaghmandan Alaghmandan, known to his friends and family as Abdi, and his family moved to the U.S. from Iran in 1995 and lived in Castro Valley. His son, Soheil, said in a brief interview Thursday that Alaghmandan was a father of two, a husband, and dedicated to his job at the VTA. “He worked overtime, he worked through the entire pandemic,” Soheil said of his father, speaking softly. “He’s a tinkerer. He can fix anything.” A substation maintainer, the 63-year-old had been with VTA for 20 years. “He’s a gentle soul who loves everyone,” Soheil said. Adrian Balleza The 29-year-old light rail operator had been with VTA since 2014 when he started as a bus operator trainee. At a Thursday morning news conference, Guadalupe Yard superintendent Naunihal Singh called Balleza “a gem of a person,” noting that he, like Singh, was killed while helping others get to safety Wednesday morning. “It shows the character of these guys,” Naunihal Singh said, “how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation.” Balleza was married with a young son, according to public records and his social media presence, and lived in the South Bay. Reached by phone Thursday, his father said he was too upset to talk. Lars Kepler Lane Lane, a lineman at VTA for two decades, was the person you’d call if you were worried the trains wouldn’t run after a San Francisco 49ers game, loved ones said, or if you needed a gourmet meal whipped up. “He was such an amazing man. He could fix anything, he could cook anything. He is so loved,” Lane’s sister-in-law, Sonja Gilchrist, said Thursday outside Lane’s home in South San Jose. Lane, 63, and his wife, Vicki Jo, were married for 22 years, Gilchrist said. They were introduced by Vicki’s daughter after Vicki’s first husband died of brain cancer about 25 years ago, Gilchrist said. “Vicki’s broken,” Gilchrist said of her sister. “Lars was the love of her life. She’s pretty devastated.” Lane would get called in for overtime to work major incidents or big events, Gilchrist said, and would wait out front of the 49ers stadium during games in case anything went wrong. But the man known to his loved ones as Kep was also an “amazing chef.” “Everything was plated fancy like a restaurant,” Gilchrist said. “He was the sauce king.” Lane was going to take the train to Sacramento after work Saturday to celebrate his 64th birthday with his family. He was a loving stepfather to Vicki’s daughter, and he had three sons of his own, as well as four grandchildren, Gilchrist said. “This was so unexpected and so tragic. Kep, he was the nicest man,” she said. “There was no reason for anyone to hurt him.” Paul Delacruz Megia While Megia’s workdays were spent overseeing colleagues, his free time was all about adventure. The 42-year-old assistant superintendent in service management had been at VTA since 2002, previously working as a bus and light rail operator before becoming a supervisor. He spent weekends fishing or skiing in Tahoe, and teaching his kids to wakeboard, said his father, Leonard Megia, 68. Going down the slopes, Paul was always in the front of the family pack, with his kids and father taking up the rear. Growing up in Redwood City after the family emigrated from the Philippines, he was a sharp kid who graduated with a degree in business administration from CSU Hayward, his father said. He was also a practical joker, especially with his children. “He liked to get them by surprise,” his dad said, starting to giggle as he recalled. “He would hide behind doors to jump out at people.” Megia usually worked from home Wednesdays, his father said, but was called in unexpectedly the morning of the shooting. Father and son live just four doors apart from one another in the Mountain House area near Tracy. Leonard Megia first learned of the shooting on television, after Paul failed to return his usual 7 a.m. phone call. It would be hours before the fire department confirmed to the family that Paul was among those killed, but Leonard Megia said he felt it in his gut. “It’s the worst thing that could ever happen to you,” he said. Jose Dejesus Hernandez III The 35-year-old substation maintainer was a Fremont native who started working as a VTA mechanic in 2012. Hernandez’ sister, Tanya, described her brother as an intelligent and hard-working man who had a passion for working on cars and other vehicles. “He knew how to take engines apart, put them back together and make everything faster,” she said. “He just had this genius mind.” Tanya said her brother had dreams of leaving the VTA and starting his own auto repair business. “He didn’t ever complain, but I know he wanted to work on cars because he was so good at it,” she said. Timothy Michael Romo The 49-year-old overhead line worker has been with the agency for more than 20 years. Romo was married to his wife, Annette, and had three children, Audrey, Scott and Tristan. Romo’s daughter, Audrey, said her dad was the “smartest and funniest” man she knew. “He was always the life of the party and all of my friends loved being around him,” she said. “I’m going to miss him everyday, but I know that I have a great support system and I have a woeful family and they’re always going to be there to get me through this.” His son Scott said his dad was his idol and hero. “He was my superman and I’ll never not miss him,” he said. A former neighbor described him as “kind and helpful” on a GoFundMe associated with Romo. “The great and happy memories made with you and your family while growing up next door will remain in my heart forever,” she added. Raised in Greenfield, a small coastal area in Monterey County, he was the son of a former mayor and police chief, Salinas-based KSBW said. Romo was most recently living in Tracy, records show.

168,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/26/vta-light-rail-operator-killed-in-san-joses-mass-shooting-alerted-coworkers-to-hide/,"Trending:  The family of Taptej Singh, a 36-year-old VTA light rail operator, waited all day for the news they wished they’d never get. Singh, married with a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter, was gunned down early Wednesday morning in a stairwell of a VTA building, they said, when he and eight other people were killed during one of the Bay Area’s worst mass shootings ever. He worked in a separate building from where other victims were killed, the family said. His supervisor, Paul Megia, also perished. Coworkers told them that Singh had left the safety of an office where others were hunkered down to help others escape. “We are in very deep grief,” said his uncle, Sakhwant Dhillon. “He told people, ‘be careful, hide.’  He was running around the building to save others’ lives.” “He was a good person. He helped everybody,” Dhillon said. Singh is one of nine victims who died at the hands of Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old maintenance worker who opened fire just after 6:30 a.m., police say. Santa Clara County Coroner’s officials released the names of all nine victims Wednesday evening. Members of Singh’s extended family, including his father, hugged and cried at the Red Cross Center in North San Jose when they were told the news Wednesday evening. Relatives and friends of many of the dead gathered at the center through the afternoon and were escorted out by authorities in small groups through the evening after the terrible news was confirmed that they had lost a loved one. San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez, whose childhood friend Michael Rudometkin also died, left the building with his wife and others without speaking to reporters. Police released few details Wednesday about how the shooting happened and why. But Singh’s brother, Bagga Singh, said he was told that his brother “put a lady in a control room to hide. He saved her and rushed down the stairway.” Although Singh may be considered a hero, his brother said, “he should have saved his life, too. We lost a good person.” The Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office identified him as Taptejdeep Singh, but family told the Bay Area News Group that he went by Taptej. Singh was born in India and was raising his family in Union City. He had worked for the VTA for about 9 years. Singh’s brother-in-law, P.J. Bath, also works as a light rail operator. Singh was working the early shift, he said. “He was always helpful to everyone and caring,” Bath said. He also added that the supervisor, Megia, was also “telling the other employees to take cover. “ Bath was told that the shooter started in a different building before encountering Singh in a stairwell. “He just happened to be in the way, I guess,” Bath said.

175,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/us/san-jose-shooting/what-we-know-about-the-victims-in-the-san-jose-shooting,"Advertisement By Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin.

176,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/killer-california-talked-workplace-attacks-77934150,"A man who was working at a California rail yard when a gunman killed nine people says the attacker worked regularly with the victims and believes they were targeted SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A gunman who killed nine people at a California rail yard where he worked appeared to target some of the victims, a sheriff told The Associated Press on Thursday, while a Biden administration official said the shooter spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines. Samuel Cassidy, 57, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose around 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag filled with semi-automatic handguns and high-capacity magazines, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. “It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there: ‘I’m not going to shoot you,’” Smith said. “And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot.” While there are no cameras inside the rail yard's two buildings, Smith said footage captured him moving from one location to the next. It took deputies six minutes from the first 911 calls to find Cassidy on the third floor of one of the buildings, Smith said. Cassidy, who fired a total of 39 bullets, killed himself as deputies closed in on the facility serving the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of Silicon Valley. More than 100 people were there at the time, and authorities found five victims in one building and two in another, Smith said. Kirk Bertolet, 64, was just starting his shift when shots rang out.         He said Thursday that Cassidy worked regularly with the victims. He called them “a good bunch of blue-collar people"" but said Cassidy stuck out as a loner and outsider. “I know some of those guys, they’ll keep joking with you and they’ll keep hammering you about stuff. And if you’re thin-skinned and you can’t take it ... I see that is the main cause of what’s going on,” Bertolet said. Sheriff’s officials described Cassidy as “a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years,"" saying that may have contributed to him targeting the workers. Documents show he had worked at the transit authority since at least 2012. Bertolet, a signal maintenance worker who worked in a separate unit from Cassidy, said he is convinced Cassidy targeted his victims because he didn't hurt people he encountered on the way to the second building, where more shots were fired. “Sam made sure he killed all who he wanted. He made sure they were dead,” Bertolet said. “I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breaths, and they were all gone. Seven of them were just gone."" After being detained by customs officers in 2016, Cassidy spoke of hating his workplace and he was found to have a memo book with notes on how he hated the Valley Transportation Authority, according to a Biden administration official who described a Department of Homeland Security memo laying out Cassidy's statements. The official saw the memo and detailed its contents to the AP but was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. The Wall Street Journal first reported the memo. It doesn't say why he was stopped by customs officers. It said he had books about “terrorism and fear and manifestos"" but when he was asked whether he had issues with people at work, he said no. The memo notes that Cassidy had a “minor criminal history,” citing a 1983 arrest in San Jose and charges of “misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer.” Cassidy's ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,"" a tearful Cecilia Nelms told the AP on Wednesday. She said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,” she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing, and she had not been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. An ex-girlfriend described Cassidy as volatile and violent in court documents filed in 2009, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body, the woman said in a sworn statement filed after Cassidy sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. Sheriff’s officials said the three 9 mm handguns Cassidy brought to the rail yard appear to be legal. Authorities do not yet know how he obtained them. He also had 32 high-capacity magazines, some with 12 rounds. In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would have been allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. The sheriff said authorities found explosives at the gunman’s home, where investigators believe he had set a timer or slow-burn device so that a fire would occur at the same time as the shooting. Flames were reported minutes after the first 911 calls came in from the rail facility. The attack was the 15th mass killing in the U.S. this year, all shootings that claimed at least four lives each for a total of 87 deaths, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. President Joe Biden urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence, saying, “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more.” Several         long-time employees were killed, many of whom worked together. “Whatever happened yesterday, it shows the character of these guys, how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation,” light rail superintendent Naunihal Singh said. The victims were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Family and friends remembered Taptejdeep Singh as a hero. He called another transit employee to warn him about Cassidy, saying he needed to get out or hide. “He told me he was with Paul, another victim, at the time,” co-worker Sukhvir Singh, who is not related to Taptejdeep Singh, said in a statement. “From what I’ve heard, he spent the last moments of his life making sure that others — in the building and elsewhere — would be able to stay safe.” Karman Singh said Thursday that his older brother had “a lion’s heart.” At an evening vigil that drew 1,000 people to City Hall, Singh said his brother “died fighting for others, and trying to save his community, his VTA community."" Annette Romo, wife of Timothy Romo, told the crowd: “I only have a few words to say: Never leave home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye. Because that was the last I got.” ——— Har reported from San Francisco, Dazio from Los Angeles and Long from Washington.

181,https://spectator.org/atf-chipman-ar-15-ban/,"   The Senate will vote this week to confirm or reject David Chipman, President Biden’s nominee to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). Chipman is a senior policy adviser at Giffords, an anti–gun rights group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) after she was severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011. Prior to that position, he was a senior adviser at Everytown for Gun Safety, which pushes misleading information on school shootings to gin up anti-gun hysteria. On paper, Chipman looks like the ideal candidate to head ATF. Before his work in the private-sector anti-gun industry, he was an ATF agent for almost 25 years. Chipman’s service at ATF included involvement in the aftermath of the 1993 Waco Massacre of Branch Davidians. The botched ATF arrest attempt of the Branch Davidian sect leader, David Koresh, led to a months-long siege of the religious compound. The siege ended only when the FBI set the compound ablaze and bulldozed it. Seventy-six people, including 25 children and two pregnant women, died in that assault, one of the worst massacres in U.S. history. In a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) thread, Chipman lied about the events of the siege, claiming that the Branch Davidians shot down two Texas Air National Guard Helicopters with .50-caliber machine guns, something that never occurred. In that same AMA, Chipman made other troubling statements. Chipman said, “While at ATF I conducted studies involving people who failed background checks to determine how many later committed crimes with a gun — many did. This is a perfect opportunity to arrest people before committing crimes rather than responding after the fact.” Chipman takes a page from Minority Report in wanting to prosecute crimes that haven’t yet been committed. The Biden administration has prioritized pushing red-flag laws at the national and state level, and as ATF director, Chipman would play a crucial role in pushing this unconstitutional agenda. Chipman is also a strong opponent of Americans owning AR-15-style rifles. In the AMA, Chipman said, “Clearly AR-15s play an outsized role in mass shootings,” but added that he recognizes that mass shootings are not the cause of the majority of gun deaths. The majority of gun deaths are suicides, and a substantial percentage are gang violence–related. In reality, mass shootings account for a minuscule 0.2 percent of gun deaths, but Chipman and the anti-gun establishment are mainly focused on these anomalous events. An anti-gun extremist is exactly who Democrats are looking for to head the ATF. In addition to Senate Democrats, identitarian police organizations, including the National Black Police Association, Women in Federal Law Enforcement, and the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, have signaled support for Chipman’s confirmation. Republicans and gun rights groups have pushed back against Chipman’s nomination. Earlier this month, House Republicans sent a letter to Senate leaders that reads, “David Chipman has made it no secret that he is an enemy of the 2nd Amendment.” In Wednesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Ted Cruz asked Chipman if he supported the banning of AR-15 style rifles. Chipman replied, “I support a ban.” Since 2006, when Senate approval became required for the post, only one ATF director has been approved: B. Todd Jones, who served from 2011–15. President Trump’s nominee, Chuck Canterbury, was withdrawn due to Republican opposition to his past involvement in gun control efforts. With the Democrats holding 50 seats in the Senate, Chipman will likely become ATF director without any Republican support. If Chipman is confirmed as ATF director, he will likely achieve more than anything even Beto O’Rourke could accomplish. This experienced operator within the ATF bureaucracy will play a crucial role in the Biden administration’s efforts to dismantle Americans’ right to defend themselves.

182,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653358962/0/phoenix/nation~San-Jose-shooting-Capitol-riot-commission-Friends-reunion-things-to-know-Thursday/,"A ninth victim has died in the shooting spree at Northern California light rail yard the ""last grim toll of yesterday's shooting,"" Mayor Sam Liccardo said Thursday. ""Now, all we can do is what we must: support our families and coworkers in pain, and assist their journey to healing,"" Liccardo tweeted. The gunman, an employee at the sprawling Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and other employees were among the victims, police spokesman Russell Davis said Wednesday. The initial eight victims were identified by the Santa Clara County coroner's office Wednesday night. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said on Twitter that a vigil honoring the victims would take place at City Hall Plaza at 6 p.m. PT on Thursday. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 Things podcast: The proposed 9/11-style panel to study the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6 could be scuttled in the Senate as early as Thursday. Democrats have been pressing for a bipartisan review of the attack, but Republicans worry that it will be used as a weapon against them in the 2022 elections. Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to join them to overcome a potential GOP filibuster of legislation creating the commission, and even among the seven Republicans who voted to convict former President Donald Trump of inciting the insurrection, opinion is divided. President Joe Biden will be in Cleveland on Thursday looking to reassure Americans that the economy is rebounding, and sell his infrastructure plan. His speech aims to counter a narrative pushed by Republicans, who have pointed to rising inflation as a sign he is moving the economy in the wrong direction with his big-spending measures. Biden's latest address comes as Senate Republicans plan to increase their offer to an infrastructure plan that totals nearly $1 trillion Thursday. The GOP already rejected Biden's slimmed-down $1.7 trillion plan last week. This may mark the final attempt at bipartisanship before Biden's self-imposed Memorial Day deadline for progress and it comes as some members of his own party are growing restless and questioning how much longer his bipartisan negotiations should continue. A new World Meteorological Organization forecast released Thursday says large parts of land in the Northern Hemisphere will be 1.4 degrees warmer than recent decades and that the drought in the Southwest will continue. The meteorologists also predict a 90% chance that the world will set yet another record for the hottest year by the end of 2025 and the Atlantic will continue to brew more potentially dangerous hurricanes than it used to. In addition, there's a 40% chance – up from 20% last year – that the world will get so hot in the next five years that it will temporarily push past the temperature limit the Paris climate agreement is trying to prevent. The new report comes on the heels of California and the U.S. government announcing an agreement to open up the Pacific Coast's first commercial wind energy farms. The pact was touted as a breakthrough to help ambitious climate change goals be reached through clean energy production. The cast of ""Friends"" finally got back together in front of the camera for some reminiscing and a lot of fun. ""Friends: The Reunion,"" the long-awaited, much-hyped reuniting of the six original cast members of the long-running NBC sitcom ""Friends,"" hit HBO Max early Thursday morning. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who starred in the hit series that ran from 1994-2004, gathered for a sweet and emotional unscripted reunion on the Warner Bros. lot earlier this spring. The reunion special also features bloopers clips from famous fans, and even the actors re-reading some old scenes together.

184,https://www.aol.com/news/official-gunfire-erupts-san-jose-152312950-055219099.html," SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — An employee opened fire Wednesday at a California rail yard, killing eight people before taking his own life as law enforcement rushed in, authorities said, marking the latest attack in a year that has seen a sharp increase in mass killings as the nation emerges from coronavirus restrictions. The shooting took place around 6:30 a.m. in two buildings at a light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority, which provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the most populated county in the San Francisco Bay Area. “When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds. When our deputy saw him, he took his life,” Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters. Deputies “were going through hallways saying, ‘Sheriff’s office!’ He knew at that time that his time for firing shots was over.” The victims, many of them longtime employees of the transit agency, were identified by the Santa Clara County coroner's office Wednesday night as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Their jobs included bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and assistant superintendent. One had worked for the transit authority since 1999. Singh had worked as a light rail train driver for eight or nine years and had a wife, two small children and many family members, said his cousin, Bagga Singh. “We heard that he chose the people to shoot, but I don’t know why they choose him because he has nothing to do with him,"" he said. He said he was told that the gunman targeted certain people and let others go. San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez said Rudometkin was a close friend. “There are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family,” he wrote on Facebook. “Eight families are feeling this same sense of loss tonight and our entire community is mourning as well.” The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive. His ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told The Associated Press that Cassidy had a bad temper and would tell her that he wanted to kill people at work, “but I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now.” Nelms, teary-eyed and shaken by the news, said her ex-husband would come home wound up and angry about things that happened at work. As he talked about it, “he would get more mad,” she said. “He could dwell on things.” When Cassidy lost his temper, Nelms said there were times she was scared. He was someone who could physically hurt others, she said. Nelms said they were married for 10 years — Cassidy filed for divorce in 2005 — and had not been in contact for 13 years. She said he had been treated for depression. Members of a union representing Valley Transportation Authority workers were meeting when the shooting began, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said, but it’s not clear the meeting was related to the attack. When she heard shots, transit authority mechanic Rochelle Hawkins said she dropped her phone. “I was running so fast. I just ran for my life,” she said. “I would hope everyone would just pray for the VTA family. Just pray for us.” Other friends and family members awaited news after being unable to reach their loved ones through calls or text messages. Some had tracked the missing person’s cellphone to the rail yard but had no information from authorities. Sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Russell Davis said he did not know the type of weapon used in the attack. As bomb squads searched the rail complex, officials were also investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned the two-story home where firefighters responded after being notified by a passer-by. Law enforcement officers cordoned off the area near the home and went in and out Wednesday. Doug Suh, who lives across the street, told The Mercury News in San Jose that Cassidy seemed “strange"" and that he never saw anyone visit. “I’d say hello, and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. Once, Cassidy yelled at him to stay away as he was backing up his car. “After that, I never talked to him again.” Cassidy had worked for Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database Transparent California, first as a mechanic from 2012 to 2014, then as someone who maintained substations. Gov. Gavin Newsom, speaking emotionally in front of a county office where flags flew at half-staff, said victims' relatives were ""waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother, their son, their dad, their mom is still alive.” “It begs the damn question, ‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?’” Another man wounded in the attack was in critical condition at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, spokesperson Joy Alexiou said. The bloodshed comes amid a rise in mass killings after the pandemic had closed many public places and kept people confined to their homes last year. A database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University that tracks every mass killing over the last 15 years shows that the San Jose attack is the 15th mass killing so far in 2021, all of them shootings. Eighty-six people have died in the shootings, compared with 106 for all of 2020. The database defines mass killings as four or more people dead, not including the shooter, meaning the overall toll of gun violence is much higher when adding in smaller incidents. At the White House, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement. San Jose, the 10th-largest city in the U.S. with more than a million people, is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of San Francisco in the heart of Silicon Valley. Trains were already out on morning runs when the shooting occurred. Light rail service was suspended and replaced with bus bridges. Wednesday's attack was Santa Clara County's second mass shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people and then himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019. The Gilroy attack was on Mayor Liccardo's mind Wednesday as text messages flooded in, reporting the shooting and fire. “Not again,"" he thought as he jumped in his car and raced to City Hall. Transit authority workers told him they knew Cassidy. “You try to understand what would possess someone to do that much harm,"" Liccardo said by phone. “It’s unfathomable.” ___ Associated Press writers Janie Har in San Francisco, John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles, and Michael Balsamo and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",2021-05-27 01:52:19,Authorities ID 8 victims of California railyard shooting,,150985,http://news.aol.com/
185,https://www.thedailybeast.com/213-mass-shootings-later-what-has-biden-done-on-guns?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH Gov. Newsom expressed his anger at both sides in Washington for enabling a cycle of grief and indifference over gun violence, asking, “What the hell is going on in this country?” White House Reporter Joe Biden once had a term for politicians who were too cautious to push for meaningful gun reform legislation: cowards. “Why in God’s name can we say that we can’t do anything about 150,000 people being shot dead in the United States of America? Why are guns different?” Biden said during a campaign stop in Las Vegas in February 2020. “Because of cowardness. Because of cowards. Cowards who are afraid to take on these special interests because they are so damn powerful.” In that address, delivered a few miles from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history, Biden promised to send a bill to Congress that would close background check loopholes and end liability protections for firearms manufacturers—on his first day in office. “I promise you I will not rest until we beat these guys, because it is immoral what’s happening,” Biden said at the time. “I promise you, if I’m your next president they’re going to be held accountable, because I am coming after them.” But 127 days—and at least 213 mass shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive—into Biden’s presidency, his administration’s approach to firearm restrictions has not been nearly as expansive as he once promised. The long-promised legislation on background checks and liability reform still hasn’t been introduced, the national gun buyback program he once floated has been put on ice, and his first executive orders addressing guns weren’t issued until April, only coming after a series of high-profile mass shootings in South Carolina, Colorado, and Georgia. On Wednesday, hours after a shooter at a rail yard in San Jose, California, killed eight people before taking his own life, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the president was “calling on Congress to take action” on gun violence, reiterating similar remarks that press secretary Jen Psaki had delivered in the wake of previous mass shootings. “What’s clear, as the president has said, is that we are suffering from an epidemic of gun violence in this country,” Jean-Pierre said, noting the smattering of executive actions issued by the president last month. Later on Wednesday, Biden issued a statement lamenting that, “yet again,” he was ordering the nation’s flag to be lowered to half-staff to mark a mass shooting. And, “once again,” that he was calling on Congress to address the crisis. “I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America,” Biden said. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more.” Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, however, didn’t hold back his anger at both sides in Washington for perpetuating a cycle of grief and indifference over gun violence. “There’s a sameness to this and I think a numbness that we’re all feeling,"" Newsom said at a press briefing with local officials. “It begs the question—what the hell is going on in this country?” Biden’s piecemeal approach to the issue reflects the limits of his power to address a problem that he has grappled with since his days in the U.S. Senate, gun control advocates say. “Voters and Americans, by overwhelming margins, support many of these proposals,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel and policy director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s only divided in Congress.” With a razor-thin Democratic majority and generally pro-gun Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) standing athwart any attempts at eliminating the filibuster, Biden’s ambitious agenda on gun control has, for now, been whittled down to the scale of his ability to enact it. The most recent example is the Department of Justice’s proposed rule change that would update the definition of a firearm to include “unfinished” components sold in gun-making kits. Weapons built from those kits, which don’t have serial numbers and are increasingly popular among weapons traffickers, are known as “ghost guns” for the difficulty of tracing their ownership. There are a smattering of gun-related bills that would accomplish much of Biden’s agenda on firearms. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act has passed the House of Representatives, and the Untraceable Firearms Act, introduced earlier this month by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) in the Senate and Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) in the House, would make proposed rule changes by the Department of Justice Department on “ghost guns” permanent. But with Republicans largely hoping to block the nomination to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of gun-control advocate David Chipman—who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee only hours before the San Jose shooting—those legislative efforts are currently taking a backseat to Biden’s economic and pandemic-relief agenda. The result? Biden has been left with little more than executive orders and proposed regulatory changes at his immediate disposal. That’s not to say that gun reform advocates are dissatisfied with what Biden has done so far. “President Biden pledged last month to treat gun violence like an American epidemic,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, saying that the rule change was proof that Biden was keeping his word. “The Biden-Harris administration’s decision to regulate them like the deadly weapons they are will save countless lives.” Gun-reform advocates are generally confident in Biden’s personal commitment to the cause, pointing to his successful passage of a federal ban on assault weapons in the 1990s and his close connections with the families of those killed by gun violence. “We certainly don’t underestimate the challenges of moving legislation through the Senate, but we are pleased that the administration has been fairly clear in what it wants Congress to do,” Skaggs said, adding that the administration hasn’t “sat on their hands” while waiting for Congress to act. “They’ve sent a strong signal that they are going to do what they can, in terms of executive action.” But whether Biden can navigate a divided Senate to pursue meaningful legislation on guns is another matter. “We’ve not had anyone in the Oval Office who has spoken about gun violence as the public health epidemic it is, who has acknowledged the role of the executive in funding and in legislation, who has used the bully pulpit, and has had the emotional connection to survivors that he clearly has,” Kris Brown, president of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, told The Daily Beast. “But obviously, any executive action has a limited potential timeframe—another administration can come in and decide that they’re going to reverse the approach taken. It’s very important that whatever is done is then backed up with legislation.” Biden knows better than most the risks of mishandling a high-visibility push for gun reform. In 2013, weeks after the murder of 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, then-Vice President Biden was tasked by President Barack Obama to draft an expansive package of gun control measures. But Biden’s deliberative pace and focus on consensus-driven legislation was seen as a drag to the process, and the long legislative result of the efforts—a bill that would have extended background checks to gun shows and Internet sales of firearms—was defeated by the filibuster. “The United States Senate let down an awful lot of people today, including those Newtown families,” Biden said bitterly after presiding over the bill’s defeat. “I don’t know how anybody who looked them in the eye could have voted the way they did.” The lesson learned from that failure, advocates said, is a simple one: Don’t weaken your own legislation before you’ve even begun the fight. “You don’t bargain against yourself… You don’t wait for consensus to emerge on an issue where history teaches it’s difficult, or just about impossible, to reach consensus,” Skaggs said. “The president, I think, learned from the past that these are challenging and difficult issues, but they are also issues that are too important not to fight for.” But while gun reform advocates are understanding to a point, there are only so many times that background check legislation backed by a large majority of the American people can fall victim to the filibuster before they call for even more fundamental reform. “We will not accept a vote on a bill that does not get us to a substantially better place with the system than we are now,” said Brown, whose organization shares a name with the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks for many firearm purchases, that Biden championed while in the Senate. If that comes to pass, she continued, “we believe the filibuster has to end.” “As goes our issue, so goes [the For the People Act], so goes the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, so goes his entire agenda, effectively,” Brown said. If that comes to pass, Biden will be forced to confront his own words on the urgency of gun reform, made in response to a shooting at a grocery store in Colorado in March. “I don’t need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take commonsense steps that’ll save lives in the future,” Biden said. “And to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act.”",2021-05-27 04:46:53,"213 Mass Shootings Later, What Has Biden Done on Guns?",,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

The shooting took place around 6:30 a.m. in two buildings that are part of a light-rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority, which provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the most populated county in the Bay Area. The facility includes a transit-control center, parking for trains and a maintenance yard. The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive. Sheriff's spokesman Deputy Russell Davis said the attack also resulted in ""multiple major injuries.""

They just kept at work, and now we're really calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy,"" said Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said it was his understanding the shooting happened during a meeting. Grief-stricken families sat huddled together, holding hands and crying, after learning they had lost loved ones, Rosen told reporters, describing the scene inside a county building. ""They're just sitting and holding hands and crying,"" Rosen said. ""It's terrible. It's awful. It's raw. People are learning they lost their husband, their son, their brother."" He said about 100 people were inside the family reunification center. Bomb squads were searching the rail complex after receiving information about possible explosive devices, Davis said. Officials also were investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned a two-story home where firefighters responded Wednesday morning. Fire crews found a fast-moving blaze after being notified by a passer-by. A neighboring house also caught fire, authorities said. Cassidy had worked for the Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database known as Transparent California. His position from 2012 to 2014 was listed as a mechanic. After that, he was a substation maintainer, the records said. Trains already were out on morning runs when the shooting occurred. Light rail service was to be suspended at noon and replaced with bus bridges, Hendricks said. ""It's just very difficult for everyone to be able try to wrap their heads around and understand what has happened,"" Hendricks said. Outside the scene, Michael Hawkins told The Mercury News that he was waiting for his mother, Rochelle Hawkins, who had called him from a co-worker's phone to assure him that she was safe. When the shooting started, ""she got down with the rest of her co-workers"" and dropped her cellphone, Michael Hawkins told the newspaper. Gov. Gavin Newsom spoke in front of a county office where flags flew at half-staff. He said victims' relatives were ""waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother their son, their dad, their mom is still alive.""

Eighty-six people have died in the shootings, compared with 106 for all of 2020. It is the sixth mass killing in a public place in 2021.

The new bills, backed by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Tom Cotton of Arkansas in the Senate and by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Tennessee's David Kustoff in the House, would force the Justice Department to expedite review of hate crimes against Jewish people and raise the maximum sentence for repeat offenders. It comes after a recent spike in reports of possible anti-semitic violence in the U.S. in the wake of deadly clashes between Israel's military and the Palestinian Islamic organization Hamas. The Anti-Defamation League noted a ""drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate"" in a May 20 statement. The text of the new legislation notes that American Jews ""have faced, and continue to face, false accusations of divided loyalty between the United States and Israel, false claims that they purchase political power with money, and false accusations about control of the financial system, along with other negative stereotypes."" Donald Trump perpetuated many of those anti-semitic stereotypes, claiming in August of 2019 that American Jews who voted for Democrats were being ""being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that."" McCarthy (CA) received widespread criticism in October 2018 for comments suggesting progressive donors of Jewish decent were trying to buy the midterm elections. McCarthy and Kustoff both voted in February against stripping antisemitic Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of her committee assignments after she spread conspiracy theories about a prominent Jewish banking family using secret space lasers to cause deadly wildfires in California. In a statement on Tuesday, McConnell (KY) said the GOP bill ""will support state and local law enforcement and ensure the bigoted thugs and criminals who are attacking Jewish Americans face the full force of American justice."" ""In the face of rising anti-Semitism, we cannot turn a blind eye. Jewish Americans deserve not just rhetorical support, but legislative action ensuring that perpetrators of these vile attacks are prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" said McCarthy. But as Democrats and a few Republicans pushed for years for legislation to expand federal hate crimes protections to include other targeted groups, such as LGBTQ people, McCarthy and McConnell and most of their caucuses fiercely opposed it. Legislation first introduced in 2001 as the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act was finally enacted in 2009 as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Both McConnell and McCarthy voted repeatedly against the expansion of hate crimes protections. Neither leader's office immediately responded to an inquiry for this story. But as of Wednesday, McCarthy's website still includes a May 2007 press release opposing hate crimes laws of any kind. McConnell fought the ultimately successful effort to pass the bill expanding protections against hate crimes to include LGBTQ people as part of a broader Defense bill, calling it ""nongermane social policy."" After the 2016 mass shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, his office refused to say whether he regretted his opposition.

          / CBS News The death toll rose late Wednesday night from the morning shooting at a San Jose, California light rail yard. Authorities initially said an employee killed eight co-workers and wounded several others when he opened fire, but later said a ninth victim had succumbed to his wounds after being hospitalized in critical condition. Officials said the suspect, 57-year-old Sam Cassidy, shot himself to death as officers closed in. Investigators are trying to determine his motive. There have been more than 60 mass shootings in the U.S. this month alone. President Biden called the shooting a ""horrific tragedy"" and ordered that flags be flown at half- staff to honor the victims. In a statement, he said ""enough"" and urged Congress to take immediate action on gun control legislation. At the scene, a visibly shaken Governor Gavin Newsom lauded the heroism of the first responders and addressed the difficulty in dealing with yet another mass shooting. ""There's a sameness to this,"" he said, ""and I think that numbness is something we're all feeling. … It begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us? And when are we going to come to grips with this?"" Cassidy had worked for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority  since at least 2012. His ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told CBS News ""his temper … was one of our biggest problems."" Still, she said, she was ""in shock, because I never thought he would do anything like that."" Nelms told The Associated Press Cassidy had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. ""I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,"" she said. Workers and family members waited across the street as law enforcement combed the facility. The victims ranged in age from 29 to 63. Bagga Singh's cousin, Taptejdeep Singh, was one of them. ""We heard that (the gunman) chose the people to shoot, but I don't know why they choose him because he has nothing to do with him,"" Singh told CBS News. Police and Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies got multiple 911 calls at about 6:30 a.m. The rail yard is next door to the Sheriff's Office and a block from the San Jose Civic Center and county offices, CBS San Francisco says. Authorities said about 75-80 people were at the facility when the shooting started, right around when the shift change for VTA workers was scheduled. The investigation was complicated after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible explosives at the site. Authorities spent the entire day combing through the facility to make sure there weren't any explosive devices on the premises. The VTA shut down rail service at noon as the search by the bomb squad continued. Officials said they didn't know when rail service would be restored. Buses ran through the day. ""These folks were heroes during COVID-19. The buses never stopped running, VTA didn't stop running. They just kept at work, and now we're really calling on them to be heroes a second time to survive such a terrible, terrible tragedy,"" said Santa Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez. Cassidy is listed as the owner of a home 13 miles away that caught fire around the time of the shooting. Fire crews got the fire under control within a few hours. Officials say cans of gasoline and hundreds of rounds of ammunition were found inside the home. Authorities described some of the items as ""bomb-making materials."" San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo announced there would be a vigil for the shooting victims at 6 p.m. Thursday at City Hall Plaza. First published on May 27, 2021 / 4:46 AM © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

The attack occurred at the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose on Wednesday. Eight people died immediately. The gunman also died, police said.
Advertisement The additional victim added to the death toll was 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch. The Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner identified the other victims as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. All the victims will be honored Thursday night at an event at the San Jose City Hall Plaza.
RELATED Gunman opens fire at Bay Area light rail yard; 8 victims dead Investigators on Thursday will try to determine why VTA maintenance worker Samuel James Cassidy, 57, shot nine co-workers and then killed himself. Those killed were located in two buildings in the complex. The attack was the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the San Francisco Bay Area. San Jose is located about 40 miles southeast of downtown San Francisco. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told CNN the victims ""knew the shooter well.""
RELATED Deputy killed, another wounded in shooting in northern California Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told CNN that Cassidy fired off 39 rounds and appeared to target specific victims. During the shooting, Cassidy told a union official present for a meeting, ""I'm not going to shoot you,"" she said. Smith said Cassidy had two semi-automatic handguns -- ""the type that would be legal in California"" -- and 11 loaded magazines in his possession. Officials said Cassidy's home was on fire Wednesday morning after he left for work, and was fully engulfed when firefighters arrived.
RELATED Police: Gunman acted alone in attack that killed 3 at Bay Area festival During an appearance on NBC's Today show, Smith said authorities believe Cassidy may have set a timer to trigger the fire at his house. ""What we're operating under now -- but I'm not sure that this isn't gonna change -- is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time probably to coincide with the shooting,"" she said. Deputy Russell Davis of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened as employees from the midnight shift were leaving and the day shift was beginning work. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen told reporters that multiple guns were used in the shooting and some other suspicious items were found at the rail yard. The bomb squad ultimately cleared the scene. In a 2009 court filing, an ex-girlfriend accused Cassidy of rape and said he would exhibit ""enraged"" mood swings that were fueled by alcohol. Neighbor Doug Suh described Cassidy as ""lonely"" and said he'd never seen any friends or family visit in the five years he lived nearby.",2021-05-27 07:52:07,Death toll from San Jose shooting attack rises to 9; police search for motive,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

197,https://www.rawstory.com/police-fbi-seek-motive-in-california-shooting-rampage/,"By Peter DaSilva and Dan Whitcomb SAN JOSE, Calif. (Reuters) - Police and federal investigators sought on Thursday to determine why a Northern California transit employee opened fire on his co-workers, killing nine people in the latest mass shooting to haunt the United States. The accused gunman shot himself as police closed in on him, minutes after gunfire erupted at about 6:30 a.m. Pacific time at a light rail yard in the heart of Silicon Valley, according to Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith. Police did not publicly name the gunman. The San Jose Mercury News and other news media identified him as Samuel Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker at the yard. Firefighters responded to a fire at a home where the suspect lived at about the same time that the shooting was first reported. A police bomb squad searched the rail yard and adjacent buildings after an explosive device was found. Police declined to speculate on a motive for the shooting rampage, saying that their work at the scene could take several days, assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms. California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference that the massacre was a symptom of a larger American problem. ""It begs the damn question, What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us and when are we going to come to grips with this?"" Newsom said. A White House spokeswoman told reporters that the shooting was further evidence that the United States was in the grip of an ""epidemic of gun violence."" LATEST MASS SHOOTING The gunman and the nine victims shot dead were all employees of the transit agency situated near the city's airport. The victims were found in two buildings on the site. The County of Santa Clara medical examiner-coroner's office identified the victims late on Wednesday. They appeared to all be men and ranged in age between 29 and 63. Their names are: Paul Delacruz Megia, Taptejdeep Singh, Adrian Balleza, Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, Timothy Michael Romo, Michael Joseph Rudometkin, Abdolvahab Alaghmandan and Lars Kepler Lane. The ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, died late Wednesday after he was taken to the hospital in critical condition, the medical examiner's office said, according to NBC Bay Area. Cassidy had worked for the transit authority since at least 2012, when he was listed as an ""electro-mechanic,"" and was promoted to ""substation maintainer"" in 2015, according to records posted by the nonprofit website Transportation California. Last year, he earned a salary of $102,000 plus benefits and $20,000 in overtime, the records showed. The suspect and another individual filed domestic violence restraining orders against one another in 2009, three years after Cassidy and his wife divorced, according court records showed. San Jose is a city of about 1 million people in Silicon Valley, a global technology hub and home to some of America's biggest tech companies. Wednesday's incident was the latest of at least nine deadly U.S. mass shootings in the past three months, including a string of attacks at Atlanta-area day spas in mid-March and a rampage days later that killed 10 at a Colorado supermarket. Last month, a former employee of an Indianapolis FedEx center shot eight workers to death before taking his own life. Earlier this month a man fatally shot his girlfriend and five other people before taking his own life at a birthday party in Colorado.

Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection."" During the segment, Kelly claimed, ""There is no question the media represented it as so much worse than it actually was,"" reports Newsweek.           Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

The family of Aiden Leos had initially put up $50,000 over the weekend in exchange for information leading to the arrest of whoever fatally shot the kindergartner during an apparent case of road rage Friday. Orange County Supervisors Don Wagner and Katrina Foley proposed using funds from their respective offices’ budgets for matching rewards Tuesday. Another business leader with ties to Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer chipped in $50,000. A collection of local businesses also contributed $50,000. An anonymous donor made a similar donation, Wagner said Tuesday. Smaller contributions continued to pour in, bringing the value of the reward to about $310,000 by Wednesday evening, said Carla Lacy, a spokeswoman for the Leos family and step-grandmother of Aiden. “As Orange County residents, our wives, husbands, and children drive the 55-freeway every day,” Bea Reyes, a representative of the business owners who contributed to the reward, wrote in a statement included in Tuesday’s release. “From the bottom of our hearts, we send our condolences to the Leos family.” The 6-year-old was in a booster seat as his mother drove Friday, when a vehicle described as a white Volkswagen station wagon cut them off to get into the carpool lane. The boy’s mom told witnesses she made a gesture at the vehicle just before gunfire struck him in the belly. The boy’s parents and siblings have sought consolation with loved ones since then, mostly in private, Lacy said. They have also been overwhelmed by the condolences of numerous strangers shocked by Aiden’s death. Donors pledged over $240,000 to a GoFundMe campaign set up to support Aiden’s family. Its proceeds will eventually cover the cost of mental health counseling, funeral services, and a car to replace the one Aiden was riding in when he was killed, as well as other expenses. “His mom’s never going to be able to sit in that car again,” Lacy told the Register during an interview Sunday.

200,https://www.thewrap.com/abc-news-2020-ratings-season/,"But “Dateline NBC” wins again with DVR viewing ABC News ABC News’ “20/20,” anchored by David Muir and Amy Robach, won the broadcast season as Friday’s No. 1 newsmagazine in “live” viewership across all key demos for the first time in five years, according to Nielsen Media Research ratings data. Adding in a week of DVR viewing, however, “Dateline NBC” still comes out on top. Friday shows tend to get a more significant percentage of their viewership on a delayed basis than other weeknights do, though news programming — even magazine shows — have more of an urgency to view night-of than scripted fare. In total “live” viewership since the season began on Sept. 21, “20/20” had a 3% lead on “Dateline,” but the lead was greater in the advertiser-coveted age demographics. In the 18-to-49 demo, the 9 p.m. ET show was up by 25% while in the 25-to-54 range, its lead was 17%. The season, which capped Wednesday, drew a total of 3.141 million Live + Same Day viewers, on average, according to Nielsen. “Dateline,” by comparison, nabbed an average of 3.045 million. During the season, ABC News ran 27 telecasts and NBC News ran 23. “Dateline” recently touted a win for the important May sweep period, averaging 3.949 million Live + 7 Day total viewers for a 15% lead, then 1.063 million viewers from 25 to 54 for a 4% lead and 753,000 average viewers from 18 to 49 for a 1% lead. That, then, was the fifth straight across-the-board May sweep win for “Dateline.” “As I look back on season 43 I am so proud of the stories we told and the critical reporting we brought to our audience each Friday night,” said Janice Johnston, who became the show’s executive producer in January. The season saw a Peabody-award nominated episode on Breonna Taylor’s killing by police and a breaking news special on the mass shooting in Atlanta earlier this year. She went on, “Our resilient, resourceful team worked hard to produce new programs throughout the pandemic, while navigating remote production and the changes brought to their own lives. It’s an exciting time to be at the helm of ‘20/20’ and I’m looking forward to what’s next.” It was a unique season, to be sure. Last December, senior executive producer David Sloan told TheWrap how 2020’s lockdowns were “a wake-up call” for his team, which worked to produce two-hour episodes remotely through much of the pandemic: “In order to stay on the air with original episodes, we knew we had to reinvent the way ’20/20’ collected material for its stories and news-gathered. We had to innovate ways to remote control a lot of our production, reporting, shooting and editing.” When it came to finding those “innovate ways” to film, the team realized that having subjects figure out their own recording methods were not going to meet producers’ standards for “20/20,” which switched to the two-hour format in 2019 and maintained during lockdown. Producer Marc Dorian explained at the time, “My colleague Jeff Schneider and I began brainstorming remote shooting ideas while we were all quarantined with one goal in mind: high-quality remote production without overwhelming the interview subject. We sent people iPhones and computer web cameras, but ultimately found that using a mirrorless Sony camera tethered to a laptop allowed us to get a higher quality shot with shallow depth of field and the exposure we wanted.” It worked, leading the show to its first across-the-board win in five years.

201,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/27/san-jose-shooting-gunman-talked-about-killing-people,"Shooter who left nine people dead spoke about killing people at work more than a decade ago, said his ex-wife First published on Thu 27 May 2021 12.56 BST The death of a San Jose rail transit worker overnight makes Wednesday’s massacre at a rail yard in the California city the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the San Francisco Bay Area. More details emerged on Thursday about the shooting that claimed the lives of 10 people, including the gunman, who law enforcement officials described as a “highly disgruntled” employee of the rail yard.  Santa Clara county sheriff officials identified the shooter at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, a longtime maintenance worker at the facility. Cassidy’s ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. Cassidy shot nine of his co-workers – bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent. One victim had worked for the agency since 1999. The Santa Clara county office of the medical examiner-coroner identified the victims as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, was transported to Santa Clara Valley medical center in critical condition and died on Wednesday evening, the coroner’s office said. “I know our whole country is really grieving with these families who have lost loved ones,” said Cindy Chavez, the Santa Clara county Supervisor, in an interview on KRON-TV. “It’s really horrific. Nine people went to work thinking they would come home – and they won’t, ever.” Many of the slain workers had long tenures with the transit agency – three had at least 20 years of service. Family members of 36-year-old Singh said co-workers who escaped the site told them that Singh had left a hiding place in a sheltered office in order to get others to safety, according to the San Jose Mercury News. “He told people, ‘be careful, hide,’” his uncle, Sakhwant Dhillon, told the newspaper. “He was running around the building to save others’ lives. Singh, who went by the first name Taptej, leaves behind a wife and one-year-old and three-year-old children. “We are in very deep grief,” said the uncle, as family members huddled crying outside a reunification center set up for families on Wednesday. Raul Peralez, a San Jose city councilmember, waited much of the day on Wednesday to hear from his middle school friend, Rudometkin, who was an overhead line worker at the rail yard – only to learn that he was one of the slain victims. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family,” Peralez wrote on Facebook of his friend, who was a member of his wedding party and regular golf partner. “Eight families are feeling this same sense of loss tonight and our entire community is mourning as well. Another victim was the nephew of someone who worked in the sheriff’s department. “I saw the immense pain in the faces of the families and I heard their cries when they got the news,” said Evelyn Tran, the acting general manager of the Valley Transportation Authority. “I felt immensely helpless.” Singh’s cousin, Bagga Singh, said the he was told that the shooter appeared to target his victims. “We heard that he chose the people to shoot, but I don’t know why they chose him because he has nothing to do with him,” he said. Dozens of other employees were able to flee the building unharmed, according to other news reports. The death toll surpasses that of the next worst mass shooting in the region, the 1993 massacre in a San Francisco skyscraper that claimed the lives of eight people in addition to the gunman. It was Santa Clara county’s second mass shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people and then himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019. The shooting started about 6.30am local time. Smith said investigators, including teams from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), are still scouring the scene for a motive. “What could possibly prompt someone to take this kind of action? We don’t know at this point,” said Laurie Smith, Santa Clara county sheriff, in an interview with the Today Show. Cassidy was “very deliberate” as he forged a path between buildings at the facility, firing from a pair of semi-automatic handguns and carrying 11 magazines of ammunition, Smith said. It was not immediately clear whether Cassidy had obtained the guns legally. The sheriff’s department later reported that Cassidy, in fact, had three handguns at the site and 32 high-capacity rounds of ammunition, which violated a California law that limits firearm magazines to no more than 10 rounds of ammunition. “The suspect has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees,” said a release. Law enforcement searches uncovered bomb-making materials in Cassidy’s work locker. Officials believe Cassidy may have planted a detonator at his home, timed to go off with the shootings, Smith added in an interview with KRON-TV. Cassidy’s home, several miles away from the shooting scene, went up in flames as the shooting started, Smith said. Law enforcement officials are also eyeing another fire that started at a nearby lumber yard at the same time. Wednesday’s shooting was the 15th mass killing in the nation this year, all of the shootings that have claimed at least four lives each for a total of 86 deaths, according to a database compiled by the Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. At the White House, Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, visited the site and then spoke emotionally about the country’s latest mass killing. “There’s a numbness some of us are feeling about this. There’s a sameness to this,” he said. “It begs the damn question of what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Meanwhile, Cassidy’s ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” a tearful Cecilia Nelms told the Associated Press. Nelms said Cassidy used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,” she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing, and Nelms said she hadn’t been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years. In court documents, an ex-girlfriend described Cassidy as volatile and violent, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body weight, the woman alleged in a 2009 sworn statement filed after Cassidy had sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. Cassidy had worked for Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database Transparent California, first as a mechanic from 2012 to 2014, and later maintaining substations.",2021-05-27 07:56:07,San Jose shooting: gunman had talked about killing people at work,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

205,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653375672/0/phoenix/nation~th-victim-dies-after-railyard-shooting-in-San-Jose-gunman-was-longtime-rail-employee-What-we-know/,"SAN JOSE, Calif. – A Northern California rail yard worker who gunned down nine other employees before taking his own life appeared to target his victims and fired more than 39 shots, the Santa Clara County sheriff said Thursday. The gunman, whose ex-wife says struggled with anger, told at least one person ""I’m not going to shoot you,"" Sheriff Laurie Smith said. ""And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot."" Smith said the 57-year-old gunman, identified as Samuel J. Cassidy, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose about 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag and opened fire at about 6:30 a.m. in two buildings at the sprawling light rail hub. VTA provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the most populated county in the Bay Area. ""When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds,"" Smith said. ""When our deputy saw him, he took his life."" Officials found three semi-automatic 9mm handguns at the scene, which included 32 individual high-capacity magazines loaded with additional ammunition, the sheriff's office said Thursday afternoon. He tried to warn his co-workers, then he was shot: Loved ones mourn victims of shooting at San Jose rail yard In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy had obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would be allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. Authorities were still investigating a motive but said the suspect ""has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees."" Cassidy, described by those who knew him as having alcohol issues, for years talked about his hatred of his workplace at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub. The details make clear the suspect employed tactics not routinely seen in mass shootings. Kirk Bertolet, a signal maintenance worker who worked in a separate unit from Cassidy, told the Associated Press he is convinced Cassidy targeted his victims because he didn't hurt people he encountered on the way to the second building, where more shots were fired. “Sam made sure he killed all who he wanted. He made sure they were dead,” Bertolet said. “I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breaths, and they were all gone. Seven of them were just gone."" U.S. customs officers detained the gunman in 2016 and found he professed a hatred of his workplace, according to a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He had ""books about terrorism and fear and manifestos ... as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA"" when Customs and Border Protection detained him after a trip to the Philippines, according to the memo reported by the Journal. 'Such extreme steps': San Jose killer intricately planned rail attack with a simple motive in mind A Biden administration official said he saw the memo and detailed its contents to The Associated Press. The memo doesn’t say why he was stopped after his 2016 trip. It notes the gunman had a ""minor criminal history"" and cites a 1983 incident where he was arrested in San Jose and charged with ""misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer."" A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the memo to USA TODAY. Timeline of events: Officers rushed into San Jose rail yard as gunshots were still ringing out The victims were mostly front-line workers: bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent. Eight victims were initially identified by the Santa Clara County coroner's office: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, was taken to a local hospital before he died Wednesday evening. Cassidy was a long-time rail company worker. Payroll records obtained by ABC-7 News indicate he earned $160,000 in base, overtime and other pay as a VTA ""substation maintainer."" Investigators are trying to determine whether he was involved in a fire at his home and another nearby blaze. He was seen on a neighbor's security camera footage leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. with a duffel bag, according to the San Jose Mercury News. About an hour later, the San Jose Fire Department received a call about a blaze at a lumber business about 5 miles away from the rail yard. Then the first 911 calls reporting the shooting at the light rail yard came in, followed minutes later by a call of a fire at the gunman's home. Smith said the gunman appeared to have set a timer or slow-burn device to set his home on fire. A woman who dated Cassidy filed a restraining order against him in 2009, accusing him of rape and sexual assault. The filing, obtained by The Mercury News, also includes accusations that he had severe mood swings and suffered from alcohol abuse. His ex-wife says he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. ""I never believed him, and it never happened,"" Cecilia Nelms said. ""Until now."" 'What the hell is wrong with us?: After San Jose shooting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asks Nelms was married to Cassidy for about 10 years before they filed for divorce in 2005. She told The Mercury News he often was angry at co-workers and about his assignments at work. She said, however, that she had not spoken with him in more than a decade. Smith told CNN and NBC a locker at the rail yard believed to be the gunman’s contained ""materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive."" The gunman's social media presence, if he had one, was not readily apparent. 'Enough': Biden urges Congress to pass gun control bills after lowering flag for latest mass shooting California Gov. Gavin Newsom met with some family members of the victims and spoke at a news conference Wednesday, expressing frustration with the cycle of mass shootings in the U.S. He praised the efforts of law enforcement at the scene but asked: ""What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?"" Later Wednesday, President Joe Biden said he was ""yet again"" ordering flags be flown at half staff to mark another mass shooting and made a plea for gun control legislation. ""I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America,"" he said. The U.S. has historically reported a gun homicide rate about 25 times higher than that of other wealthy nations. In 2021 alone, there have been 15 mass killings, each with at least four victims dead, according to an Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University database. All cases were shootings and claimed a total of 87 lives. Wednesday's mass shooting was Santa Clara County's second in less than two years. In 2019, a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and wounding 17. Bacon reported from Arlington, Virginia.; Hauck from Chicago.

Next month, the state is giving 10 vaccinated Californians $1.5 million each just for getting jabbed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a $116.5 million vaccine incentive program to be split between previously immunized Californians and unvaccinated residents who agree to be immunized. The state-funded program, which Gov. Newsom coined “Vax for the Win,” will provide $50 cash or grocery cards to the next two million Californians who get vaccinated  and a total of $16.5 million in cash prizes to all Golden State residents who are vaccinated. “The state of California today is announcing the most significant incentive program in the United States of America,” Newsom said Thursday at a Los Angeles vaccination center. Thirty vaccinated Californians will win $50,000 cash prizes on “$50,000 Fridays” on June 4 and June 11. And on June 15, California will randomly select 10 vaccinated residents for the biggest prizes — $1.5 million each. California’s cash and grocery prize drawings are the state’s effort to speed residents’ progress toward herd immunity in advance of a targeted June 15 state reopening. Any vaccinated Californian who is 12 or older is automatically entered in the drawings. Winners younger than 18 will receive the money in a savings account until they are 18. The state’s effort comes amid similar efforts across the country to encourage more residents to get a coronavirus vaccine, particularly people in hard-hit communities including places like Ohio, Oregon and other states. The governor noted that some states are inducing vaccinations by handing out fishing and hunting licenses, and others are providing liquor shots. More than 60% of Californians have gotten at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, but the state still estimates there are roughly 12 million residents who are eligible to be vaccinated who have not gotten a shot. With the state set to reopen more fully and lift mask mandates next month, state leaders have said it is important to get as many residents as possible inoculated to prevent another deadly surge of COVID-19 cases. The Golden State governor’s big reveal comes as CVS Health also announced that people vaccinated at one of its clinics would be in line to enter a sweepstakes for an opportunity to win a series of prizes, including a trip to Bermuda, seven-day cruises and a VIP trip to Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles. And California is not the first state to offer rewards for getting vaccinated. Colorado recently launched a sweepstakes for vaccinated residents where five people will each get $1 million. Ohio has a similar program in place and saw a surge in vaccinations after announcing the plan. Maryland is giving out $40,000 for 40 days to vaccinated residents, capped off by a $400,000 prize on July 4. Oregon will give one vaccinated person $1 million and one resident of each of the state’s 36 counties will win $10,000. The state is also offering scholarships for students. New York state is offering vaccinated residents passes to New York State Parks, and New York City has announced incentives like tickets to sporting events and theater memberships. New Jersey created a “shot and a beer” program where vaccinated residents 21 and up can get a free beer at certain breweries during the month of May if they show their vaccination card. And lawmakers in Illinois unveiled a bill there for a similar program. Related Articles

An April poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found that one in five Californians are hesitant to get the vaccine, with 7% saying they want to wait a year or more to get jabbed and 12% saying they don’t plan to get vaccinated at all. Infectious disease experts say that with highly contagious variants of the coronavirus spreading and significant vaccine hesitancy, reaching a point of herd immunity — where enough people are vaccinated that the virus has trouble spreading and eventually disappears — is increasingly unlikely. But as vaccination rates rise, hospitalizations and deaths decline dramatically, so the more people California vaccinates, the less of a threat the virus is to residents. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF, said Newsom’s incentive is unlikely to change many minds — but it could reassure people who already want the shot, especially those who are holding out due to worries about the cost of missing work.  He estimated that the incentives could boost vaccination rates by about 10%. “I don’t think California is expecting everybody to suddenly run out and get vaccinated,” he said.

209,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/27/us/san-jose-shooting/california-gun-laws,"The gunman targeted his co-workers at a transit agency, killing nine of them, the Santa Clara County sheriff said. Border officials once found writing by the gunman about how he hated his workplace. ‘He is the hero.’ A San Jose survivor says a call from one of the victims saved his life. ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. Union leader: ‘We will never know’ what motivated the gunman to target colleagues. The gunman’s ex-wife said he had complained about his co-workers years ago. At memorial vigil, signs for gun control and ‘Prayers 4 San Jose.’ The municipal transit worker who the police say shot and killed nine of his colleagues at a rail yard in San Jose was stopped by border officials in 2016, during which they searched his bags and found writings about how he hated the agency he worked for, according to an official who described a message that was circulated within the Homeland Security Department after Wednesday’s shooting. The gunman, who the authorities said killed himself and was identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, was stopped by Customs and Border Protection officials in August 2016 as he returned from a trip to the Philippines, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. In addition to the notebook with writings about how he hated the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, where he worked, the officials also found books about terrorism and manifestoes, the official said. The police in California said on Thursday that they were still trying to understand what led to the shooting, but that they had discovered more firepower at the scene than they had initially reported. Three semiautomatic handguns were found at the scene, as were 32 high-capacity magazines which each held a dozen nine-millimeter rounds, said Deputy Cian Jackson, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. He said at least one witness had reported that the gunman told someone at the scene that he was not going to hurt them, suggesting that he may have selected his victims. Detectives were continuing to interview witnesses on Thursday to try to understand what had happened, though a statement from the sheriff’s office said the gunman had been “a highly disgruntled V.T.A. employee for many years.” “The general vibe we get is that he didn’t like anybody and nobody really liked him,” Deputy Jackson said in an interview. He added that the police had feared that there was an explosive device in the gunman’s locker at work, but that none was discovered. He declined to comment on the report of the 2016 stop by border officials, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Homeland Security Department, which includes Customs and Border Protection, also declined to comment on the stop and did not respond to a question about whether the border agency had shared information about it at the time. The gunman had carried out the rampage early on Wednesday morning at the same time that his house was erupting in flames more than eight miles away. Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters that based on photographs of at least two of the guns, they appeared to be legal to buy in California, though she did not say whether Mr. Cassidy had purchased them legally. Californians voted in 2016 to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, as the gunman’s did, but it was blocked from going into effect by a judge after a lawsuit by the National Rifle Association. A legal battle over the law is ongoing. Sheriff Smith said the gunman had been “very deliberate” in killing his colleagues at the transit agency near downtown San Jose, and that he had killed himself as deputies rushed into the rail yard from their headquarters next door. Sheriff Smith said on NBC’s “Today” show that the fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was first reported three minutes after someone had called 911 to report gunfire at the rail yard, suggesting that he may have set off “some kind of device” to start the blaze as he opened fire. She said investigators had found “explosive materials” at the suspect’s home. — Eileen Sullivan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Shawn Hubler and Thomas Fuller The phone call came at 6:36 a.m. and lasted for 44 seconds. Sukhvir Singh, a mechanic at the rail yard where nine of his colleagues were killed, says the call on Wednesday morning was the difference between life and death for him and a half dozen co-workers. On the line was a colleague, Taptejdeep Singh, with an urgent warning. “He was talking quite fast,” Sukhvir Singh said. “He said, ‘Hey! There’s an active shooter. Get out.’” Sukhvir Singh, who specializes in repairing and maintaining the light-rail trains that run through San Jose, fled with his crew members to a windowless building that houses antique rolling stock. There they waited until sheriff’s deputies arrived. The man who made the call was killed by the gunman. Sukhvir Singh said he was told that his body was discovered on a staircase. Few employees at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the agency where the shooting took place, have told their stories of survival. Outside a union hall on Thursday, rank-and-file members said they had been told they would be fired if they spoke to reporters. Sukhvir Singh said he wanted to speak out as a tribute to Taptejdeep Singh, whom he described as an unfailingly gracious and helpful colleague. The two men are not related. “There are still people out there who want to help others more than themselves,” he said. “He is the hero for everyone.” The killing of Taptejdeep Singh, he said, also underlined the senselessness of the shooting. He said the gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, barely knew Taptejdeep Singh. They worked in different departments. Mr. Cassidy worked in Building B, which handles the maintenance of electrical substations. Taptejdeep Singh was a light-rail operator who when he was not driving trains was in Building A, where trains were serviced. “They didn’t have any connection at all,” he said. For a time Sukhvir Singh worked in the same building as Mr. Cassidy. He would pass him in the halls and say hello. At best Mr. Cassidy would acknowledge him with a grunt, he said. “He didn’t really communicate with other people,” he said. “He was in his own world.” — Thomas Fuller Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright A leader in a labor group that represents the workers killed at the rail yard in San Jose this week expressed frustration and bewilderment about the gunman’s motives on Thursday. “No issues that we know of that were red flags — but what is a red flag?” said Arturo Aguilar, chairman of the California Conference Board of the Amalgamated Transit Union, in an interview on the lawn outside the union’s San Jose office. “We are not trained to analyze co-workers.” Mr. Aguilar said the union did not see patterns in which of his colleagues that Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, chose to shoot. The nine victims who were killed on Wednesday came from various departments, he said. “We don’t know the relationships or the correlations between the victims and the shooter,” Mr. Aguilar said. “And we will never know.” The union’s main task right now, Mr. Aguilar said, was consoling members, many of whom gathered at the union’s office on Thursday. — Thomas Fuller The ex-wife of the man who fatally shot nine people at a San Jose rail yard this week said he grew angrier during their 10-year marriage and had complained about his co-workers, saying, “I wish I could kill them.” The gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, and his ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, 64, divorced in the mid-2000s, she said in an interview, and had not spoken in 13 years. Ms. Nelms said that Mr. Cassidy, who proposed three months after they met in a nightclub in Cupertino, was initially the perfect husband. She said he loved pets — including several boa constrictors — and swam at a nearby gym. “He was a good guy, very affectionate, thoughtful, polite,” she recalled. But over the years, Ms. Nelms said, Mr. Cassidy’s personality changed. He grew meaner, angrier and more impatient, hating when her family members dropped by their home unannounced. “It was escalating, little by little,” she said. “Every time we had an argument, he would start yelling and screaming, hitting the walls, banging the table, slamming the door. Very intimidating.” Eventually, the arguing became too much, and the couple divorced. Ms. Nelms said Mr. Cassidy took medication for depression and had complained about his co-workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, grumbling that some were lazy or had easier jobs than he did. Occasionally, she said, Mr. Cassidy would say, “I wish I could kill them.” But she did not think he was serious at the time, and said she was shocked when she heard that Mr. Cassidy had killed several of his colleagues. “That was the last thing I would think he would do,” Ms. Nelms said. “I was just shaking.” One thing in particular made no sense to her. Mr. Cassidy, she said, had never expressed any interest in guns. — Kellen Browning transcript “Today, we’re here together as one community. We’re here because members of our community, our colleagues, our family members, our friends, our loved ones are suffering, and each of us feels our own pain as well.” “Paul was a wonderful husband and father, who was full of love. All of you who know him knows he’s full of jokes. He has energy for life, and always up for new adventures. I will treasure all our memories. He was a great friend, son, mentor to all. He was so proud of being an employee at V.T.A., and all the accomplishments he made here.” “Whatever you need to do to get some support. I know I need it myself, but these aren’t names to us. These are people we know and we love. And we’ve seen every single day of our working lives. And it really, really hurts down to the very core of our souls. So please, A.T.U., let’s do what we do and stand with each other for each other by each other.” “I only have a few words to say. Never leave home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye. Because that one was the last I got.” SAN JOSE, Calif. — Hundreds of people gathered in a plaza outside the San Jose City Hall rotunda on Thursday evening to memorialize the nine transit authority employees who were killed by a co-worker at a rail yard the day before. Some arrived holding signs calling for gun control or offering “prayers 4 San Jose.” Others wore union pins, shirts and masks. A few held flowers. Family members crumpled to the ground in front of a memorial for the victims, an arrangement of bouquets, wreaths, American flags, photos and hats for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Mayor Sam Liccardo and other officials spoke, but most in the crowd were too far away to hear what was said. When the microphones failed, many people pulled out their phones and listened to a stream of the speeches on Facebook. Some cried silently. “Tonight, we’re united in our commitment to our diverse community, where we prioritize togetherness over division, hope over fear, progress over violence,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren, one of the speakers. “We don’t have to be the only country on earth where mass shootings are a near-daily occurrence.” A memorial for the nine VTA employees. pic.twitter.com/lNamd7s2VV In front of flags flying at half-staff, transit workers gathered. Some knew the victims and were at the rail yard at the time of the shooting. Most declined to speak about the attack. Walter Hale, a V.T.A. employee, said that when he heard the news Wednesday, “I was done, I was destroyed.” But on Thursday, he said, “I knew I needed to be here with my brothers and sisters.” — Kellen Browning Investigators do not yet know whether the victims of Wednesday’s shooting at a rail yard in San Jose were specifically targeted, and they have not identified a motive for the gunman, Laurie Smith, the sheriff of Santa Clara County, said in an interview Thursday morning on NBC’s “Today.” “What in the world could possibly prompt someone to take this kind of action?” she said. “We don’t know at this point.” Officers confronted Samuel James Cassidy, whom California law enforcement officials identified as the gunman, “within a few minutes,” Sheriff Smith said, suggesting the carnage could have been worse if they had not arrived quickly. The sheriff’s office headquarters is next door to the rail yard. Mr. Cassidy carried two semiautomatic handguns and had 11 loaded magazines, she said, adding that police dogs at the scene found materials for bombs in what investigators believe to be his locker. Investigators are also looking into how a fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was apparently started while he was carrying out the attack. The police received the first report of shots fired at 6:34 a.m., and the call reporting the fire came in at 6:37 a.m. “What we’re operating under now, but I’m not sure that this isn’t going to change, is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time, probably to coincide with the shooting,” she said. The nine victims of the shooting were spread over two buildings, she said. “He was very deliberate, very fast,” she said. “He knew where employees would be.” — Daniel Victor Everything was set for an ordinary day in a suburban corner of southeastern San Jose on Wednesday. Doug Suh had an early golf game scheduled. Andy and Alice Abad were preparing for a morning doctor’s appointment. And Anthony Nguyen was, as always, set for his daily 9:30 a.m. church service. But by early afternoon, each resident of the neighborhood discovered in their own way that something had gone very wrong. Early on Wednesday, Abad watched from his kitchen as a funnel of smoke and flames poured from a home one block away. Suh got a call from a friend on the golf course about a man who had killed eight workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard. (It would later become nine.) And Nguyen got a similar call from a friend but with a more disturbing detail: “The man who did it was your neighbor,” Nguyen’s friend told him. By noon, their neighborhood was swarming with multiple fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights in the cul-de-sacs of what they all described as a quiet suburban neighborhood that is home largely to Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. Investigators on Thursday morning were still piecing together the havoc unleashed the day before. The suspect in the shooting, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade, lived in a one-story home with white trim and a patchy lawn. (Mr. Cassidy lived near the Evergreen neighborhood, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Officials said Wednesday that they believed Cassidy was responsible for both setting his home on fire and then proceeding to shoot his colleagues at his workplace, the railway yard eight miles from where he lived. Suh, who lives across the street from the suspect, scanned through his security camera footage when he returned home from his golf game. The camera captured Cassidy at 5:40 a.m. loading his white pickup truck with a black bag. He was wearing a uniform with reflective stripes. Nguyen, a retired real estate broker who has lived in San Jose for the past four decades, said he was baffled by what had happened. “Everything has been very perfect,” he said of his neighborhood. “People are nice and quiet here.” When he saw flashing lights on the corner of his street on Wednesday, he assumed there had been a traffic accident. Then his friend called with the news about the shooting. “What about all these families that lost sons and fathers?” Mr. Nguyen asked in his driveway. “I’m so sorry for them. It’s not right. All these broken hearts.” — Thomas Fuller California has some of the most progressive gun laws in the country and is one of two states to receive a full A rating from the Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun reform. The state requires universal background checks for gun owners and restrictions on the size of magazines, along with other laws that restrict the types of firearms that a person can legally purchase. But after a mass shooting on Wednesday that claimed nine lives at a San Jose rail yard, politicians including Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Biden urged lawmakers to take further action in legislating firearms. In a statement, Mr. Biden urged Congress to “heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence.” It is unclear what type of weapons were used by the gunman, whose body was found at the scene, where he had acquired them, or whether they would have met California’s legal standards. The state bans the possession of assault weapons, with some exceptions, and bans so-called ghost guns, which are typically assembled by an individual and do not contain a serial number. According to the Giffords Law Center, which also gives an A rating to New Jersey, California has the seventh-lowest rate of gun deaths in the country, and has the most robust system for taking guns from people who are barred from having them. At least one of California’s gun laws is being challenged in court. In August 2020, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a state law that banned the possession of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. In February, however, the court said it would reconsider that decision. — Will Wright The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-27 09:02:13,California’s gun laws are some of the most restrictive in the nation.,,1,http://nytimes.com

Until now,” Cecilia Nelms, his ex-wife, told the Associated Press. “He could dwell on things.” The attacker, identified by officials as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, killed eight at a rail yard in San Jose Wednesday before taking his own life as police confronted him. “When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds. When our deputy saw him, he took his life,” Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters Wednesday. The county’s medical examiner office identified the victims killed, several of whom were longtime rail yard employees. Victims were identified as: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III; 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim who died at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center was later identified as Alex Ward Fritch, 49.

Gavin Newsom during a press conference Wednesday. “When are we going to put down our arms — literally and figuratively — our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand-wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration … over and over again?” The attack is the 15th mass shooting in the U.S. so far this year, according to an AP, USA Today and Northeastern University database.

211,https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/San-Jose/?id=77938467,"Employee Samuel Cassidy, 57, allegedly gunned down nine men. San Jose community mourns 9 victims of mass shooting The man who allegedly gunned down nine people in San Jose, California, on Wednesday planned the massacre and ""was prepared to use his firearms to take as many lives as he possibly could,"" the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department said Friday. At Samuel Cassidy's home, investigators found multiple cans of gasoline, suspected Molotov cocktails, 12 guns and about 22,000 rounds of various types of ammunition, the sheriff's office said Friday. Authorities do not have a motive for why Cassidy, a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority employee, allegedly shot and killed nine men at the VTA light rail yard Wednesday morning. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office said co-workers described Cassidy as ""disgruntled."" ""Detectives are investigating his relationship with VTA,"" the sheriff's office said Friday. Authorities said they believe he acted alone. A fire was reported at Cassidy's house minutes after the shooting, and the sheriff's office said investigators believe Cassidy ""coordinated the destruction of his residence."" The search of Cassidy's home is ongoing. San Jose Fire Department spokesperson Erica Ray said on Friday that it's complicated by ""heavy"" damage that rendered the residence ""uninhabitable."" The fire seemed to burn quickly, she added. San Jose police spokesman Steve Aponte said a ""hoarder situation"" further hampered the search. Cassidy died at the transit hub on Wednesday, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Thirty-nine shots were fired at the scene, authorities said. Three semi-automatic handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines were found at the light rail yard, officials said. The guns are believed to be legally purchased and didn't appear to be modified, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said Thursday. There were magazines that could hold up to 12 bullets, which are illegal in California, authorities said. There was no indication those were modified for rapid shooting, Smith said. FBI Special Agent In Charge Craig Fair told ABC News on Thursday that investigators have obtained surveillance footage that captures the shooter walking into the building before the incident. FBI agents are working five crime scenes within the site and will be mapping them out digitally to recreate the shooting, he said. Kirk Bertolet, a VTA employee, was in a secure room at the transit hub when shots rang out. He said he felt helpless listening to the gunshots. When the shooter moved to another building, Bertolet said he ran to help his friends and coworkers but they were already dead. Bertolet said he believes the shooter targeted his victims and spared others. He said the gunman looked at one of his coworkers, who was curled up on the floor, but didn't shoot her. ""She was right among everybody else,"" he said. Beyond an arrest in the 1980s over a ""minor"" incident, the suspect had no other known criminal history, authorities said. Cassidy was questioned by Customs and Border Protection in 2016, three sources familiar with the probe told ABC News. He was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents while returning to the U.S. from the Philippines in August 2016. He allegedly was carrying books about terrorism and manifestos, which was the reason for the stop, sources said. Cassidy was also allegedly carrying a notebook in which he wrote about his apparent hatred of his workplace, according to sources familiar with the matter. This development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing the ongoing investigation, but said in a statement: ""Under the leadership of Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas, in February, DHS commenced a department-wide review which included efforts to ensure law enforcement personnel have the tools and training to identify behavioral indicators associated with targeted violence and policy to improve information sharing with our partners.""

[+] Penguins in Game Six of the First Round of the 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs at the Nassau Coliseum on May 26, 2021 in Uniondale, New York. (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images) About two-and-a-half hours before faceoff at Nassau Coliseum Wednesday night, a hype video provided many of the 8,000-plus Islanders fans (there were some Penguins jerseys scattered amongst the sellout crowd of 9,000) more reminders of all the things they’ve heard about yet never experienced. After the dozens of videos from the franchise’s dynasty years were followed by a smattering of post-Cup images and clips, the visual calendar flipped between 1993 and 2020 in a couple blinks of the eye — the Islanders’ version of Krusty the Clown declaring nothing happened between the second moon landing and Poochie joining Itchy & Scratchy. Something happened Wednesday night, when the Islanders clinched a playoff series at the Coliseum — the building that’s come and gone and come again — for the first time in 28 years by beating the Penguins, 5-3, in Game 6 of an Eastern Conference quarterfinal. The win served as a deafening two-and-a-half hour catharsis for a fan base residing in an area whose difficulties since 1993 have gone well beyond the generally substandard performance of the Islanders. “I just said to the guys, listen, you know when you’re older, you realize you can see the moments and you appreciate the moments,” Islanders head coach Barry Trotz said. “You may not have that many moments as a player, as a coach, as a person in life. And this is a moment that you don’t want to slip by and go ‘I should have’ and all that. “This was a good moment. This is a good moment for that group in there. This is a good moment for the guys that have played in this building a lot.” For most of the last three decades, the Islanders were too often in a state of disrepair that mirrored that of the building they called home. Of the 26 teams in the NHL in 1993-94, only two made fewer trips to the playoffs over the subsequent 25 years than the Islanders, who qualified eight times (the Panthers and Whalers/Hurricanes made it five times each). And every single team that existed in 1993-94 made a conference finals over the next quarter-century except the Islanders, who didn’t get back to the NHL’s final four until last summer, half a continent and one country away in the Edmonton bubble. The three straight trips to the conference semifinals or beyond under the management duo of Trotz and Lou Lamoriello mark the first time the Islanders have gotten out of the first round at least three consecutive times since a seven-season run from 1979-85, a stretch that included the four consecutive Stanley Cups. “It’s been quite a while, quite the journey and a lot of guys in here that have been around,” said Brock Nelson, one of seven players remaining from the Islanders team that closed the Coliseum for the first time in 2015. “This is a special place, a special group. Everybody wants to go out there and win and compete for a Stanley Cup.” That type of sustained success by the Islanders isn’t the only thing that is simultaneously part of the local fabric yet also lacking any real-time evidence it ever existed. The suburb and the idea of having it all — commuting from a spacious place to live into a well-paying job in a big city — was basically born from the post-World War II housing boom on Long Island. But it’s been decades since the Island offered a realistic chance at affordable home ownership, and thousands of its residents are bleary-eyed and short-tempered five days a week on the Long Island Rail Road or one of the area’s innumerable slow-moving highways. Over the last generation, the challenges of living on the Island have been amplified by previously unimaginable perils. Train station parking lots still evoke the memories of the Colin Ferguson mass shooting on a packed LIRR car in December 1993 and the haunting images of the days following 9/11, when lots were filled with the cars of commuters who parked there the morning of the terror attacks and never returned. Within a 30-minute drive of the Coliseum are hundreds of houses on stilts, still being rebuilt following the catastrophic damage delivered by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The sight of 9,000 mask-wearing fans Wednesday provided an unneeded reminder of the impact the coronavirus pandemic has made on Long Island, where 383,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and more than 6,500 have died. Of course, this is “just” sports, and a single series clinched at the Coliseum doesn’t ease or erase the trials Long Islanders have endured over the last three decades. And it was easy to forget Wednesday night that the Islanders are still three series wins shy of the ultimate prize. The euphoria of moving on to the second round could soon be followed by the disappointment of being eliminated — perhaps even at the Coliseum by the Boston Bruins in the conference semifinals, which will likely start this weekend. But even if the Islanders don’t exit the Coliseum for UBS Arena — scheduled to open this fall at the Nassau/Queens border — with that long-awaited fifth Cup, Wednesday night provided a defining and unexpected moment a generation in the making as well as equal parts reward and relief to a fan base that’s fiercely proud of its lineage, on and off the ice. The roaring crowd Wednesday was a reminder fans refused to accept the move to Brooklyn’s Barclays Center and that the return to the Coliseum as UBS Arena was built is the most remarkable story of fans willing a team to come back since the Browns were returned to Cleveland. The Islanders three-goal flurry in a span of fewer than three minutes in the second period allowed for the anticipation to build, for the sights of Ralph Macchio — one of the Island’s many pop culture exports in the 1980s before the pipeline mostly dried up— and core dynasty member John Tonelli exhorting the fans on the scoreboard to serve as a bridge between the past and present before the “WE WANT BOSTON” chants and derisive chants aimed at Sidney Crosby began in the waning minutes. More than an hour after the Islanders mobbed each other to Maxine Nightengale’s “Right Back Where We Started” and the subsequent handshake line, there were still dozens of fans hanging out outside their cars singing Billy Joel’s “Piano Man” (speaking of Island pop culture exports) and drinking beer. The streets around Nassau Coliseum were filled with the rhythmic “Let’s Go Islanders” honks. A team that’s relied so often on mining relevancy from its past has plenty to look forward as it gets ready to head to UBS Arena. On Wednesday night, it was enough to make islanders think the same could be true for them. “There’s moments that you’re going to enjoy,” Trotz said. “This is a moment that, with the crowd the way they were, the importance of the game, all that — this is one of those moments that you back in your memory bank and when you finish your career, you’ll remember this more. “Because this was a good moment for everyone.” I have covered professional sports in the northeast for a variety of online and print publications since 1997.

213,https://nypost.com/2021/05/27/gunman-samuel-cassidy-talked-about-killing-colleagues-for-years-ex/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Lee Brown Submit May 27, 2021 | 9:50am				| Updated May 27, 2021 | 9:51am San Jose mass killer Samuel Cassidy was an accused rapist who had fantasized about killing colleagues for more than a decade, according to new reports. Cassidy told then-wife Cecilia Nelms about his plans to kill colleagues at Valley Transportation Authority during their 10-year marriage which ended in 2005, she told The Associated Press. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” his ex said tearfully Wednesday, soon after her ex slaughtered nine colleagues at San Jose’s VTA Light Rail Facility. “He could dwell on things,” she told the wire service of the ex she had not heard from in at least 13 years. Nelms also told The Mercury News that her ex “had two sides.” “When he was in a good mood, he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad,” she said. She told the San Francisco Chronicle that her ex “didn’t have friends that I could say (were) friends, friends,” and would vent about coworkers getting plum assignments. “I would listen but hardly ever ask any questions because I didn’t know these people,” she said. Still, she said that while he “could be mad and probably mean” she “never thought he would do this.” After his divorce, Cassidy was accused of raping a girlfriend he met in 2008 on Match.com — with the woman blaming his “mood swings” which she also believed were linked to him being bipolar, her lawyer told The Daily Beast. “She felt that he was bipolar, that his moods ran hot and cold,” the ex’s attorney, Robert Gary Cummings, told the outlet. They dated for about a year, but the relationship turned ugly after Cassidy proposed two months in, and the ex — who was not identified — said it was “all too soon,” Cummings said. “And that then became a big issue for him in their relationship. And he started to gaslight her, if you will,” Cummings told The Daily Beast. The pair traded domestic violence restraining orders, and the ex accused Cassidy of repeatedly raping her as well as trying to force her into anal sex, the report said. “Several times during the relationship, he became intoxicated, enraged, and forced himself on me sexually,” the ex-girlfriend, who was 45 years old at the time, said in 2009 court documents obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. She said Cassidy — who was 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds — would hold her arms to her side and force his weight on her during the assaults. “He also played several mind games, which he seems to enjoy,” the filings stated, with emails making clear that his ex’s friends did not like him. “All my girlfriends think you treat me like s–t,” she wrote in one email in the filing, the Chronicle said. The relationship ended on Valentine’s Day in 2009 when she refused to have anal sex — and he’d moved another woman into his house without telling his ex what the relationship was, according to the reports. Despite the brutality of her claims, the ex is still shocked to hear that he would become America’s latest mass shooter, her lawyer said. “Even with the allegations that she put in [the court filings]… she was shocked by it,” Cummings told The Daily Beast. Cassidy’s 88-year-old dad, James Edward Cassidy, insisted that his son “seemed completely himself” in the days before the incident. “He didn’t talk about his job or politics. I just found out he was dead and his house on fire and all that a minute ago,” he told The Daily Beast Wednesday. Cassidy had worked for Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, first as a mechanic from 2012 to 2014, then as someone who maintained substations, records show. He received $160,000 in total pay and benefits, according to public records from 2019. He killed Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, died later in hospital. With Post wires Read Next Senate approves Biden Army secretary pick after rescinding...

214,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/san-jose-vta-rail-yard-mass-shooting.html?via=rss,"California law enforcement officials are still piecing together clues in search of a motive for the mass shooting at the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose on Wednesday morning that left nine dead, including the gunman.* Police were notified of shots being fired at 6:34 a.m. local time at the public transit service that operates bus and light rail in the region and have identified 57-year-old VTA employee Samuel James Cassidy as the shooter. Cassidy, who worked in maintenance and had been employed by the VTA for more than a decade, showed up at work Wednesday morning as the midnight shift and dayshift employees overlapped and shot and killed eight people in the maintenance yard of the rail yard before shooting himself. Police identified the victims as: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Some of the victims were confirmed co-workers at the VTA, which employs 2,000 people, but it’s unclear if all were workers at the public transportation depot. In the aftermath of the shooting, a bomb squad scoured the area for bombs after a dog detected the presence of explosive material. Light rail service was suspended for the day.

San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said co-workers had been worried about the shooter and “expressed generalized concerns about his mental health.” Neighbors described being fearful of the 57-year-old who was the only one they ever saw coming and going from his house. Former partners described an unstable man, prone to violent mood swings, who expressed contempt for his job and bosses. Surveillance video of the shooter’s house taken Wednesday morning showed a man believed to be the gunman leaving with a duffel bag. Police say more than one gun was used during the shooting. Soon after, a fire was reported at the shooter’s home that left the structure uninhabitable. Correction, May 27, 2021: This post originally misstated that San Jose is in Southern California.

216,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/27/vta-mass-shooting-sheriff-says-gunman-had-2-semi-automatic-handguns/,"Trending: The VTA maintenance worker who fatally shot nine co-workers and then himself at a light rail yard Wednesday morning was a “highly disgruntled” employee who came to the facility armed with 32 illegal high-capacity magazines, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday. The gunman in the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting, identified as 57-year-old Samuel James Cassidy of San Jose, opened fire upon co-workers in two buildings at about 6:34 a.m. Wednesday, and took his own life as law enforcement officers closed in, authorities said. A fire erupted at his San Jose home around the same time. The gunman fired 39 times, apparently selecting his targets, Sheriff’s Deputy Russell Davis said, telling at least one person at the rail yard, “I’m not going to shoot you,” during his rampage. The Sheriff’s Office wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon that its investigators are still determining Cassidy’s motive for the shooting, but have so far confirmed that he was “a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” A VTA spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday morning when asked whether Cassidy had a disciplinary history, or if any employees had reported feeling threatened by him. The three handguns Cassidy used in the shooting were all legally obtained, FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Fair said in an interview Thursday. But the magazines he carried with him and used violated California law. The Sheriff’s Office previously said the gunman had 11 pistol magazines that held 12 rounds each, making them illegal high-capacity magazines in California, which mandates 10-round limits under a state law that is being challenged in court. On Thursday afternoon, they updated that total to 32 high-capacity magazines. Fair said investigators also found expended 15-round magazines at the shooting scene, which is made up of five separate locations within the Guadalupe Yard complex where Cassidy traveled. Cassidy also “had numerous other firearms legally registered to him, including shotguns and long rifles,” Fair said, though only the three handguns were found at the scene. Motive still under investigation According to a Wall Street Journal report Thursday, a Department of Homeland Security memorandum indicated that Customs and Border Protection agents detained Cassidy in 2016 as he was returning to the U.S. from the Philippines and found he harbored a hatred for his workplace. The memo, which the Journal said was distributed at DHS after the shooting Wednesday, said Cassidy was found to possess “books about terrorism and fear and manifestos … as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA,” when Customs and Border Protection detained him. “When asked if he had problems with anybody at work, he stated, ‘no.'” It was unclear whether that information was shared at the time with VTA and local authorities. DHS officials were not immediately available to comment. Fair said he could not speak to the Customs and Border Protection incident, but said Cassidy had never been investigated before by the FBI. The fire Wednesday morning at Cassidy’s home on Angmar Court, which he appeared to set to coincide with his rampage, has made the investigation into his motive more difficult, Fair said. Ammunition inside the home exploded during the fire, Fair said, and its second floor collapsed, forcing investigators to search through the rubble “for additional firearms, explosives, ammunitions, any evidence he may have left behind that may suggest motivation or ideology.” “At this point, we do not know conclusively what drove him to this,” Fair added. It also remains unclear what has been recovered at Cassidy’s home aside from what sources said were weapons and ammunition. Davis said a search warrant was set to be served at the home Thursday, continuing a lengthy police presence that included San Jose police, the sheriff’s office, the FBI and the ATF. A neighbor’s security video showed Cassidy leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. dressed for work and loading a large black duffel bag into his white Ford pickup truck. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said the fire at Cassidy’s house was reported at 6:37 a.m., about an hour later. “What we’re operating under now — but I’m not sure that this isn’t going to change — is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time, probably to coincide with the shooting,” Smith said in an interview on NBC’s “Today Show” on Thursday morning. Cecilia Nelms, Cassidy’s former wife, said Thursday that while he worked at the VTA, he several times talked about hurting or killing colleagues who had angered him. “He’d say, ‘I’m going to beat him up,’ or sometimes he’d say, ‘I’m going to kill the son-of-a-gun,'” said Nelms, 64, of Santa Cruz. Nelms said she’d become accustomed to Cassidy’s enraged ranting, including about colleagues, and she didn’t take his comments seriously. “Sometimes people say things like that when they’re mad,” she said. “He never mentioned names.” Cassidy didn’t talk about guns, and when he spoke of beating or killing co-workers, he didn’t mention shooting them, she said. She never knew him to own firearms, she added. Nelms earlier told this news organization that Cassidy’s anger toward colleagues often appeared to arise from his belief that he was given harder jobs. “In an active shooter scenario, very rarely does somebody just snap. There is a reasonably lengthy ramp-up period of mobilization,” Fair said. “But all along that process, active shooters have been leaking information and projecting pre-attack indications that are overt and obvious to the public, to the community, to law enforcement and mental health professionals.” ‘He was very deliberate, very fast’ The three guns authorities now say Cassidy was armed with is one more than Sheriff Laurie Smith had indicated Thursday morning in television interviews, in which she offered additional details about the rampage. “We know that the suspect entered the facility and began shooting, and there were deceased in two separate buildings,” Smith said. “We believe he went from building to building.” The sheriff’s office on Thursday evening released surveillance footage of Cassidy walking through the light rail yard. In a statement, the sheriff’s office said Cassidy initially opened fire in Building B on the west side and then walked toward Building A on the east side. Smith said the massacre was over within minutes as law enforcement officers from her office — one block from the rail yard — and San Jose Police responded and closed in on the gunman. “It was a short period of time before our deputies were able to confront the suspect,” Smith said, adding that while it was unclear whether the gunman reloaded his pistols, “I know to be able to reload a semiautomatic handgun is very quick.” VTA has held active-shooter training for employees, but not at the rail yard where Wednesday’s shooting occurred. “I think he was very deliberate, very fast,” Smith said. “He knew where employees would be. We were there just within a few minutes. But I really credit the officers from the San Jose Police Department and the Sheriff’s Office deputies who confronted the suspect very quickly. And when they confronted the suspect, he took his own life.” Smith did not provide further detail about the weapons in the interview but added that there were no explosives found at the Valley Transportation Authority rail yard. During the investigation, sheriff personnel using bomb-sniffing dogs located several possible suspicious devices on the VTA property. The Sheriff’s Office Bomb Squad responded to render the scene safe. Smith said early Thursday on “Today” that “our dogs alerted on probably what is his locker and in it was materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive. And I think they also found at least rounds at the house, too.” Davis said later that the bomb technicians swept the railyard facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible bomb-making materials in Cassidy’s locker, a suspicion exacerbated by the presence of wires that they thought could be detonator materials. Ultimately, they found no explosives at the facility, and upon closer examination the items in Cassidy’s locker were deemed to not be dangerous, Davis said. Shooting ruptured ‘VTA Family’ VTA officials at a news conference Thursday morning provided more information about the nine light rail yard workers who were killed in the attack. They have been identified as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Tapdej Singh, 36; Adrian Belleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michel Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. Three of the victims — Hernandez, Alaghmandan and Fritch — were substation maintainers, the same job held by the man who killed them. Romo, Rudometkin and Lane were overhead line workers; Singh and Balleza operated VTA’s light rail vehicles; and Megia was an assistant superintendent. Many had long tenures at the transit agency that describes its workforce as the VTA Family — three had been with the authority for at least 20 years, and a fourth had 19 years of service. “I’m angry, I’m sad, I’m lost for words,” said Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of the Guadalupe Yard. “At the same time, I’m trying to find the reasons why.” Singh shared an office with Megia, and supervised both Balleza, who he called “a gem of a person,” and Taptej Singh, described as a helpful and positive co-worker. Survivors have passed along reports among VTA workers that Taptej Singh and Balleza were killed while trying to get their fellow employees to safety Wednesday morning. “It shows the character of these guys,” Naunihal Singh said, “how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation.” At a vigil outside San Jose City Hall on Thursday evening, Councilmember Raul Peralez confirmed Amalgamated Transit Union Local 265 President John Courtney was spared during the shooting. “When I woke up to news about the active shooter yesterday at 7 a.m., I immediately thought about my friend. I sent him a text message that has not been returned and will never be returned,” Peralez said. Related Articles

“I reached out to him and John Courtney immediately afterward. What I didn’t know is that John was standing right there, barely escaping death, watching my friend get murdered,” he continued. “Thank you, thank you, John.” Evelynn Tran, VTA’s interim general manager, described feeling “immensely helpless” Wednesday as she watched families learn their loved ones had been killed. “We get up every morning safe in the belief that when we go to work, that we would come home to our family and our loved ones,” Tran said. “That did not happen for Abdolvahab, Adrian, Alex, Jose, Lars, Michael, Paul, Taptejdeep and Timothy.” The Sheriff’s Office asks anyone with information regarding the shooting to call the Sheriff’s Office at 408-808-4500.

                    Martha Mendoza, Associated Press SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — An employee who gunned down nine people at a California rail yard and then killed himself as law enforcement rushed in had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago, his ex-wife said. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” a tearful Cecilia Nelms told The Associated Press on Wednesday following the 6:30 a.m. attack at a light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority. “When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds. When our deputy saw him, he took his life,” Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters. READ MORE: Employee shoots, kills 8 at California rail yard, police say The number of people fatally shot by the gunman rose from eight after the Santa Clara County’s medical examiner-coroner late Wednesday night confirmed the death of Alex Ward Fritch, 49, to multiple San Francisco Bay Area media outlets. He had been wounded and hospitalized in critical condition after the attack. The sheriff’s office is next door to the rail yard, which serves the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive but his ex-wife said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,” she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing and she hadn’t been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. It was the 15th mass killing in the nation this year, all of them shootings that have claimed at least four lives each for a total of 86 deaths, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. At the White House, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the site and then spoke emotionally about the country’s latest mass killing. “There’s a numbness some of us are feeling about this. There’s a sameness to this,” he said. “It begs the damn question of what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” The shooting took place in two buildings and killed employees who had been bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent over the course of their careers. One had worked for the agency since 1999. Eight victims identified earlier were Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Singh had worked as a light rail train driver for eight or nine years and had a wife, two small children and many family members, said his cousin, Bagga Singh. “We heard that he chose the people to shoot, but I don’t know why they choose him because he has nothing to do with him,” he said. San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez said Rudometkin was a close friend. “There are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family,” he wrote on Facebook. “Eight families are feeling this same sense of loss tonight and our entire community is mourning as well.” The shooter had more than one gun, county District Attorney Jeff Rosen said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had obtained the guns legally. In court documents, an ex-girlfriend described Cassidy as volatile and violent, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body weight, the woman alleged in a 2009 sworn statement filed after Cassidy had sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle. WATCH: Senate Judiciary Committee holds gun violence hearing focusing on safe storage The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.
Cassidy had worked for Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database Transparent California, first as a mechanic from 2012 to 2014, then as someone who maintained substations. Officials also were investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned the two-story home where firefighters responded after being notified by a passerby. Law enforcement officers cordoned off the area near the home and went in and out Wednesday. Doug Suh, who lives across the street, told The Mercury News in San Jose that Cassidy seemed “strange” and that he never saw anyone visit. “I’d say hello, and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. Once, Cassidy yelled at him to stay away as he was backing up his car. “After that, I never talked to him again.” Wednesday’s attack was the deadliest shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman attacked law offices in San Francisco’s Financial District, killing eight people before taking his own life. It also was Santa Clara County’s second mass shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people and then himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019.

He wanted to help them escape, they told his family. Singh, 36, frantically called others to warn them. He ran through the building, trying to secure it. He helped a woman hide in a control room, The Mercury News reported. Then he was gunned down in a stairway. Singh's brother, Karman Singh, said in a statement Thursday that his family was comforted hearing how he spent his final moments trying to keep others safe. “Even in these moments of chaos, Taptejdeep was living by the values of Sikhi: living in service and protection of others,"" the statement on behalf of Singh's family said, referring to his religion. ""We choose to remember Taptejdeep as the hero he was, both in those final moments and throughout his life of service.” Light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent were among the victims of Wednesday's shooting spree at a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) facility in San Jose. Many of the victims were longtime employees. They were identified by the Santa Clara County coroner’s office Wednesday night as Singh; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, was taken to a local hospital, where he died. A GoFundMe spokesperson said a centralized hub for identifying and verifying fundraisers for the victims and their families has been set up at gofundme.com/san-jose-strong. At a Thursday news conference, VTA light rail maintenance operations manager George Sandoval pointed out the strong connection among many of the agency's employees. ""Many of these folks worked here for 20, 30 years, so yes, we do become a family,"" Sandoval said. ""Our staff respond to emergencies on the rail and there’s a bond."" The shooter, also an employee, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, San Jose police spokesman Russell Davis said. Authorities were still trying to determine a motive. The latest: 9th victim dies after rail yard shooting in San Jose; gunman was longtime rail employee Singh worked as a light rail train driver for at least eight years and had a wife, a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter, according to the family statement, released by the Sikh Coalition. He was born in Punjab, India, and immigrated to California with his parents 17 years ago, the family statement said. ""We can’t believe he’s gone,"" said Singh’s uncle, Sukhwant Dhillon. Sukhvir Singh, another VTA employee who is not related, said in the statement that Singh called him to warn him about the shooter. ""Because of him, so many people were able to go home to their families,"" Sukhvir Singh said. ""We will never forget how he lived to the highest ideals of Sikhi in a moment of crisis, and my prayers are with his family and the families of all those who lost loved ones in this horrific attack."" The Sikh Coalition, an organization that works to protect civil rights such as freedom of religion, has reached out to offer help to Taptejdeep Singh's family. The group’s website said Sikhism is the world’s fifth-largest religion, with more than 25 million followers, including about 500,000 in the U.S. “The Sikh Coalition is devastated by the loss of life at yesterday’s VTA shooting in San Jose, CA,’’ the organization said in a tweet Thursday that included a photo of Singh. Through social media postings, interviews and a Thursday news conference, relatives, friends and co-workers shared remembrances of the victims. His wife, Gloria Rudometkin, remembered his smile and ""open heart"" and warm, outgoing nature in a Friday statement. After 19 years together, she said she will miss him forever. ""Michael is the first person I gave my heart to and to have it broken this way is utterly cruel,"" she said in the statement. ""I will never understand why such a wonderful and gentle person had to be taken from us in this way,"" she added. ""I am heartbroken that I will never hear another one of his bad jokes, receive one of his great bear hugs, celebrate another joint birthday together or be able to give him a hard time about his terrible driving."" His parents, Rose and Gary Rudometkin, said in a Friday statement that their son was passionate about his work with VTA and involvement in his union, ATU Local 26. He was a youth minister and pastoral council member at Queen of Apostles Church in San Jose. And he was an avid golfer, snowboarder and San Francisco 49ers fan. ""He had so much life to live, and dreams and goals to accomplish,"" the statement said. ""Michael was the kind of guy that would give his last penny and shirt off his back. He gave himself selflessly to anyone who needed it before asking for anything for himself."" His sister and brother-in-law, Janelle and Alfredo Aguirre, described him as  ""the kind of man that people just naturally gravitated towards."" ""This tragedy has cut his life too short and we are unable to process how we’re feeling and what is happening,"" they said in a Friday statement. San Jose Council member Raul Peralez, a close friend of Rudometkin's, said in a Facebook post that he and his dad had been planning a golf day reunion with Rudometkin. ""My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family,"" he wrote. ""Eight families are feeling this same sense of loss tonight and our entire community is mourning as well."" Family members were sharing photos tagging what appeared to be Rudometkin's Facebook profile. Rudometkin started as an overhead line worker in December 2018, according to the Facebook profile. More: After San Jose shooting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asks, 'What the hell is wrong with us?' His cousin, Christina Marie, mourned Rudometkin on Facebook and posted photos of him alongside family and friends. ""We lost our dear Cousin Mike today in the San Jose’s VTA mass shooting,"" she wrote. ""He was the nicest person in the world. He loved his family so much. Please pray for our family. We are so devastated."" Hernandez, a substation maintainer with a knack for fixing things, was partnered at work with Samuel Cassidy, the man identified as the shooter, according to Hernandez's father. Jesus Hernandez II, who also used to work at the VTA, said he didn't know of any problems his son or any other co-workers had with Cassidy, whose former wife said he often complained about working at the agency. In a tearful interview with The Associated Press, Hernandez said his son was ""a really good guy, a great kid, and now he’s gone.” “I feel really sorry for all those families, because these things aren’t supposed to happen,'' he said. ""I feel sorry for the family of even the person who did this thing.” Lane, an overhead line worker who joined the VTA in 2001, was a grandfather and left behind a wife and three children, as well as six siblings, his family told KTXL. His wife, Vicki, told ABC7 News that they were preparing to celebrate his birthday this weekend. He would have turned 64. The two had been married for more than two decades and planned to retire next year, according to the station. ""He was my soulmate,"" she told the station. ""Love of my life. He was a wonderful person. I'm going to miss him. I miss him now. So much. This just doesn't seem real."" Lane's brother told KTXL that waiting to hear news of his loved one was torturous. “Waiting 10, 12, 14, 18, 28 hours, it’s horrific,"" Edward Lane told the station. ""That’s devastation."" Megia was described as ""a ray of sunshine"" by friend Melissa Santos Poquiz. Light rail superintendent Naunihal Singh said of him: “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile.” KCRA-TV in Sacramento said Megia was born in the Philippines and arrived in the U.S. as a toddler. He joined the VTA in 2002 and moved up from bus operator trainee all the way up to assistant superintendent in service management. His parents told the station he and his wife, Nicole, had three children and had been looking forward to a trip to Disneyland this weekend. ""Paul was a wonderful husband and father who was full of love, jokes, energy for life and always up for new adventures,'' his wife said in a statement. ""I treasure all of our memories.'' Balleza joined VTA in 2014 as a bus operator trainee and then became a maintenance worker and light-rail operator, said Glenn Hendricks, chair of the authority’s board. Phil Guzman, a friend of Balleza's, wrote that seeing him was sometimes the highlight of his day. ""It was kinda like having a younger cousin around when you were there,"" the Facebook post said. ""Adrian Balleza, my friend, I will truly miss talking trash with you. I miss you, my friend."" Romo, an overhead line worker and power foreman, worked at the VTA for 20 years. He was planning a trip with his wife to visit their son before he was killed, his neighbor Keith Baldwin told the San Francisco Chronicle. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” his neighbor Nancy Martin told the newspaper. KSBW-TV said Romo grew up in the California Central Coast city of Greenfield, where his father, Mike Romo, was the mayor and police chief. The city posted its condolences to the family Thursday. A substation maintainer known as Abdi, Alaghmandian had been with the VTA for 20 years. His son, Soheil Alaghmandan, told the Mercury News his father was a dedicated employee. “He worked overtime,'' said Soheil, 33. ""He worked through the entire pandemic. He’s a tinkerer. He can fix anything.” Soheil's girlfriend, Megan Staker, told the San Francisco Chronicle that when they moved to the Bay Area from Des Moines, Iowa, in 2018, the elder Alaghmandian  “became like a second father to me. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives.” Fritch, a substation maintainer, was the only one of the victims not to die at the rail yard. A GoFundMe page set up to celebrate his life and raise funds for his memorial says, ""He loved his Tiki crawls, dirt bikes, Star Wars, being with his wife Terra, and loving life with his family. ""He was known to be an optimistic man, passionate man, a dreamer who loved his family with all his heart. The page also says Fritch was the sole provider for his family, which includes two teenage boys, and that he ""fought to stay long enough to let his loved ones say goodbye.'' Flags flew at half staff as California Gov. Gavin Newsom said victims’ relatives were “waiting to hear from the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to find out if their brother, their son, their dad, their mom is still alive.” “It begs the damn question,"" he said. ""‘What the hell is going on in the United States of America?’” There have been 15 mass killings in 2021, each resulting in at least four victims dying, according to an Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University database that tracks every mass killing over the past 15 years. All 2021 cases have been shootings, and they have claimed a total 86 lives. ""There are at least eight families who will never be whole again,"" President Joe Biden tweeted Wednesday. ""Every life taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We must do more.""

The gunman, whose ex-wife says struggled with anger, told at least one person ""I’m not going to shoot you,"" Sheriff Laurie Smith said. ""And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot."" Smith said the 57-year-old gunman, identified as Samuel J. Cassidy, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose about 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag and opened fire at about 6:30 a.m. in two buildings at the sprawling light rail hub. VTA provides bus, light rail and other transit services throughout Santa Clara County, the most populated county in the Bay Area. ""When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds,"" Smith said. ""When our deputy saw him, he took his life."" Officials found three semi-automatic 9mm handguns at the scene, which included 32 individual high-capacity magazines loaded with additional ammunition, the sheriff's office said Thursday afternoon. He tried to warn his co-workers, then he was shot: Loved ones mourn victims of shooting at San Jose rail yard In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy had obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would be allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. Authorities were still investigating a motive but said the suspect ""has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees."" Cassidy, described by those who knew him as having alcohol issues, for years talked about his hatred of his workplace at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub. The details make clear the suspect employed tactics not routinely seen in mass shootings. Kirk Bertolet, a signal maintenance worker who worked in a separate unit from Cassidy, told the Associated Press he is convinced Cassidy targeted his victims because he didn't hurt people he encountered on the way to the second building, where more shots were fired. “Sam made sure he killed all who he wanted. He made sure they were dead,” Bertolet said. “I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breaths, and they were all gone. Seven of them were just gone."" U.S. customs officers detained the gunman in 2016 and found he professed a hatred of his workplace, according to a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He had ""books about terrorism and fear and manifestos ... as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA"" when Customs and Border Protection detained him after a trip to the Philippines, according to the memo reported by the Journal. 'Such extreme steps': San Jose killer intricately planned rail attack with a simple motive in mind A Biden administration official said he saw the memo and detailed its contents to The Associated Press. The memo doesn’t say why he was stopped after his 2016 trip. It notes the gunman had a ""minor criminal history"" and cites a 1983 incident where he was arrested in San Jose and charged with ""misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer."" A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the memo to USA TODAY. Timeline of events: Officers rushed into San Jose rail yard as gunshots were still ringing out The victims were mostly front-line workers: bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent. Eight victims were initially identified by the Santa Clara County coroner's office: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. A ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, was taken to a local hospital before he died Wednesday evening. Cassidy was a long-time rail company worker. Payroll records obtained by ABC-7 News indicate he earned $160,000 in base, overtime and other pay as a VTA ""substation maintainer."" Investigators are trying to determine whether he was involved in a fire at his home and another nearby blaze. He was seen on a neighbor's security camera footage leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. with a duffel bag, according to the San Jose Mercury News. About an hour later, the San Jose Fire Department received a call about a blaze at a lumber business about 5 miles away from the rail yard. Then the first 911 calls reporting the shooting at the light rail yard came in, followed minutes later by a call of a fire at the gunman's home. Smith said the gunman appeared to have set a timer or slow-burn device to set his home on fire. A woman who dated Cassidy filed a restraining order against him in 2009, accusing him of rape and sexual assault. The filing, obtained by The Mercury News, also includes accusations that he had severe mood swings and suffered from alcohol abuse. His ex-wife says he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. ""I never believed him, and it never happened,"" Cecilia Nelms said. ""Until now."" 'What the hell is wrong with us?: After San Jose shooting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asks Nelms was married to Cassidy for about 10 years before they filed for divorce in 2005. She told The Mercury News he often was angry at co-workers and about his assignments at work. She said, however, that she had not spoken with him in more than a decade. Smith told CNN and NBC a locker at the rail yard believed to be the gunman’s contained ""materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive."" The gunman's social media presence, if he had one, was not readily apparent. 'Enough': Biden urges Congress to pass gun control bills after lowering flag for latest mass shooting California Gov. Gavin Newsom met with some family members of the victims and spoke at a news conference Wednesday, expressing frustration with the cycle of mass shootings in the U.S. He praised the efforts of law enforcement at the scene but asked: ""What the hell is wrong with us, and when are we going to come to grips with this?"" Later Wednesday, President Joe Biden said he was ""yet again"" ordering flags be flown at half staff to mark another mass shooting and made a plea for gun control legislation. ""I urge Congress to take immediate action and heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence in America,"" he said. The U.S. has historically reported a gun homicide rate about 25 times higher than that of other wealthy nations. In 2021 alone, there have been 15 mass killings, each with at least four victims dead, according to an Associated Press/USA TODAY/Northeastern University database. All cases were shootings and claimed a total of 87 lives. Wednesday's mass shooting was Santa Clara County's second in less than two years. In 2019, a gunman opened fire at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Gilroy, California, killing three people and wounding 17. Bacon reported from Arlington, Virginia.; Hauck from Chicago.

There's nothing to get upset about, you just do what you aretold.A part of being in a society is being civilized and obedient, I do what I'mtold and I'm turned out great so far. We need (Inaudible). We need fines.And it's always southwest, isn't it, Juan? Always southwest. Why? Theyshould start putting sedatives with the peanuts when they hand them outbecause people are amp up on that airline met.WILLIAMS: Dagen, how much does this have to do with the politicization ofmask wearing?DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: It has nothing to do withthe politics of it, and listen, this woman who knocked two teeth out ofthis flight attendant, a fine isn't enough.DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: Right.MCDOWELL: The FAA is going to have to start banning people. Flying is aprivilege, not a right. But since 9/11 in the last 20 years, you know, theflight attendants have a great deal more enforcement power, and the rare,rare, rare flight attendant, you've -- we've all encountered them, is powertripping and instead of flying the friendly skies it's flying the shut upand sit down skies.And so, with the mask issue, people don't like being harangued, violence isnever acceptable but we've all experienced that flight attendant. And letme just finish with, listen, I have a volcanic temper, it can erupt at afuneral if somebody steps on my new shoes.And I've been flying for 50 years and I have never caused a ruckus on theplane. I have never been arrested on a plane so if I can contain myself, ifsomebody takes their flip-flop off and put their big Chewbacca foot betweenthe seats and like my hand touches it, if I can compose myself in thatinstance, everybody should be able to mind their own business and followdirections.WILLIAMS: OK. So, Dana, I was thinking, you know, when you get on anairplane -- this is something Jesse was touching on actually -- when youget on an airplane you have no First Amendment rights, you have no SecondAmendment rights, obviously. But you are in a -- you are basically gettinginto a company, a corporate, you know, corporate rules, governmentregulations rule, so what do you think people don't get? Are they justrebelling against all these rules?PERINO: I don't. It does feel like, you know, hopefully it's not going tobe a trend, and although those numbers were pretty high, like 2,500 is alot. It could be that people --WILLIAMS: Yes.PERINO: -- have been cooped up for a year and now they are out there andthey're getting back to social norms. But I also think that this would --it's not enough, these fines of $10,000, I think that the fine should bemuch higher and they should be enforced immediately. And I think a ban.There has to be some sort of consequence.But also, Secretary Mayorkas, you know, again, the administration has veryconfusing mask of guidance.WATTERS: Yes.PERINO: He's at his press conference by himself there at the podium with amicrophone and I'm pretty sure he's vaccinated and he's wearing a mask, andI can barely hear him. And at some point, we are going to have to have aconversation, companies and airlines, on the subway about the mask thing.Because they came out today and said if you are vaccinated your chances ofreinfection are like .000 percent. So, if you feel that way, and thenthere's a question, should you have to show your vaccine card to get onflight? I'm not saying you should have to because there are people thatmight not actually be able to get the vaccine for lots of different reasonsor they refuse, whatever it is.But I'm not saying these aren't hard conversations but we need to starthaving them. Plus, I'm pretty sure everyone needs to start serving bettersnacks.WILLIAMS: Well, that's a good point. So, Greg, I was thinking about howmuch stress there is around these days, you know, shooting down the streettoday, obviously, eight people died in a mass shooting in San Jose, you'vegot more of these hateful kind of hateful comments, hate crimes beingcommitted against Americans against Americans.What would you say to our leaders to try to heal us, to try to like, youknow, get back to, you know, this is a good time, let's be kind to eachother?GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST: Well, I think if you look at any incidentin any conflict whether it's in the air or in line at McDonald's or on theroad, what you're seeing is a disturbing lack of conflict resolutionskills. This is why parents, mentors and good teachers matter becausethat's where you learn to reduce the heat.Unfortunately, and it's a combination of factors, lack of accountability,the rise in social media, we have a generation, we have a lot of people whoonly know how to turn up the heat, they don't know how to reduce the heat.So, when you are put in a situation like this where, I call it thesubstitute teacher theory where the flight attendant or airline personnelhas the heavy burden of dealing with somebody they have never met before.And they have to exert authority over that person or else they lose thewhole classroom.Now you see this with substitute teachers, they kind of almost overly-discipline because they need to send a message to these people that don'tknow them. I think there is a-- there is a real serious misconception overwhat is considered acceptable behavior. We've never seen more lack ofaccountability in today's culture, felons are charged and released beforecops are done doing their paperwork.We talked about, well, we need the airlines to really do a firm hand. Wellno one is doing a firm hand in Portland, right?PERINO: Right.GUTFELD: So, we tolerate -- if we are tolerating this behavior on thestreet as you point out and violent felons get arrested and released in amatter of hours, do not be surprised when you see dramatic spikes ofviolence on planes --PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: -- when you have the recidivism of thugs who a year ago wouldhave been jailed for years are now out, you know, hurting people. So, Ithink that, I think we've got -- there's a number of factors in there andthen you just got to talk about how unpleasant it is to fly.This is -- this is an industry that unlike so many other industries havenot improved. It is incredible, everything has gotten better. Computers,cell phones, cars but airlines just seem --PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: -- airlines are like Coca-Cola, same flavor for the last 50years.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: Delta has made some improvements, Greg, and as a SkyMiles memberI'd like to commend Delta for those improvements.GUTFELD: Well done, Jesse. I love -- I have Delta miles.WATTERS: Good for you.GUTFELD: Thank you.WILLIAMS: Yes.WATTERS: I'll see you up there.WILLIAMS: All right, guys, your Delta miles are protected. Up next,President Biden finally open up -- opening up a probe in the COVID lab leaktheory after shutting down a previous investigation. Next on THE FIVE.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)PERINO: President Biden ordering U.S. intelligence to redouble theirefforts to find out exactly where the coronavirus came from. That is afterhis administration shut down an investigation led by former Secretary ofState Mike Pompeo to do the same thing.Biden putting out a statement today that says the intel community is splitbetween two likely scenarios on COVID's origin, a Wuhan lab leak or animalto human contact. They have 90 days to report back to the president.Republican senators argue Biden didn't really have a choice.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Joe Biden and the Democrats need to stop theircover-up that is benefiting the Chinese communists at the expense of theAmerican people.SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): The only reason that Biden is doing this, it'sbecoming untenable not to look into whether the virus originated in aChinese lab. We need to find out what happened so it never happens again.And if the source of COVID-19 that world the world upside down is from alab in China, we need to hold China accountable.(END VIDEO CLIP)PERINO: All right, Jesse. So, we here we are, I have a little list. Ithought you'd like it but I'll do it quickly. When Pompeo and others,remember they say it comes from a lab, they were ridiculed. We'll talkabout that in a moment as well. Then Pompeo and U.S. intelligence startsthis investigation, Biden gets elected, shuts it down, now says theNational Security Council will do it.When all of that is happening, the Wall Street Journal has a story thatsays, actually three people in China went to the hospital, actually itlooks like it could be coming from a lab. And now all of a sudden, there'sa new investigation and redoubling of efforts. How does this sit with you?WATTERS: So, you get Joe's schedule every day. Usually maybe one kind ofhalf event comes out. Today the schedule comes out, he has nothing.Nothing. He has no events. Very light day. I don't know what he does.So on a day that he has nothing to do, and the report comes out that saysyou just killed the investigation into the lab, he comes out and releasesthis big statement and says, we are going to investigate this lab theoryand it was the day after the White House press secretary said we didn'tneed to actually do this investigation.Come on, and now the spin comes out that oh, yes, the people that weredoing the investigation for Trump, yes, it was kind of sloppy.PERINO: Right.WATTERS: The guy doing it was a bloodhound, Dana, he investigated Al Qaedafinances, he worked for both parties, he had a legit resume.PERINO: Yes.WATTERS: So, I don't trust whatever the intelligence team is going to putout for Joe Biden. No credibility to me, they could have some good peoplein there, some patriots but he hired a bunch of Russia hoaxers, Trumphaters, corporate lobbyists in there. They're not going to get to thebottom of it and he's right.The cover-up continues, the question is, who are they covering up for? Arethey covering up for Fauci, are they covering up for China and corporateAmerica? Are they covering up for Hunter? Has hunter even divested fromthat investment fund? I don't think he has, so what's going on here?Let me just play like some logic here, Dana. If it didn't come from a wetmarket, OK, if it came from a wet market, then why two weeks after thepandemic was unleashed to the wet markets go back up and running. Why dothey still have wet markets all over China?I mean, if it came from a wet market wouldn't the Chinese say, yes, this iswhere it came from, we are going to ban this and point to the species thatit came from. No. Instead, what they did was they silenced and disappearedthe scientists, erased all the files at the lab and now the state media inChina blames the U.S. military for unleashing it. Does that sound likesomeone has everything under control?PERINO: It does not.WATTERS: No.PEROINO: And then there's a media angle, Greg. I love this paragraph fromJim Geraghty of the National Review. He was writing about the lab leakpossibility and he got absolutely ridiculed. So today he writes this, youmorons. Idiots. Schmucks.You all sat there, so smug and confident that you were the smart ones, andthat knuckle-dragging little old me, with my YouTube video from an expatGoogle Translate versions of Chinese- state health agency web sites, andold medical- research papers, had to be chasing Bigfoot and Elvis and UFOs.Set up the buffet table of crow, because I want to watch all of you eat alot of it. Will they do that?GUTFELD: No, they won't. In fact, they're not trying to cover up anything,they are just trying to cover their butts. By the way, I have to -- youknow, we have to express some sympathy for the wet market industry, I'vebeen on the line with the national wet market association, tradeassociation and they've been hit pretty hard by this and it's going to takea while for the wet market industry to bounce back from this unfair smear.The pangolin's, the bats, you know, delicious, delicious but no one iseating them, Dana. But I think, you know, what happens is this is justanother example of whatever Trump does, no matter if it's right, we can'tdo it. If he found the solution to aging, CNN would come out in favor ofeuthanasia.So they cannot -- they cannot be on the same side as him even though itturns out that he's been -- he's got a pretty good batting average if youlook at, you know, probably the first real, you know, loudest voice onChina, right? Even before the pandemic, the travel ban.Remember when he pushed Operation Warp Speed and we can't trust the vaxsaid the media, said Biden, we can't trust that because Trump. What is thatsound like? It just sounds like -- it sounds like this. We can't trust whatthe truth is because it's Trump even though it's the truth. And this iswhere the big problem lies.Even if Trump was wrong about something, you should still do the news, youidiots. I'm starting to sound like Geraghty. These are two separate issues.They are two separate issues. Like, you can say I don't like Trump,therefore I don't trust him on this issue. But I should really explore thelab leak since it seems to be the simplest explanation. you should be ableto do both of them. That's not on Trump. That's on the news.PERINO: Juan, why do you think the administration all of a suddenannounced today a redoubling of efforts and 90 days to report back?WILLIAMS: I think you said it, Dana. We now have from intelligence sourcesreports about these two or three people, apparently people who were at thelab who got sick, and this is going back into much earlier than we knew andgot sick with symptoms. We are not sure but it could be that they got sickwith symptoms of COVID.So, we have more information from public sources that would justify thatkind of investigation. I mean, right now there should be, there's noquestion it there needs to be an investigation. There are more conspiracytheories and origin theories about this than the Kennedy assassination sowe need to get to the bottom of it. You can't trust China in my opinionbecause it's a repressive authoritarian regime where the truth can get youkilled.So, I think that we've got to somehow find a way to get this done. Now, youknow, you guys are talking about what Pompeo did, I'm not sure that Pompeois the right guy to do this, because remember, the Trump administrationhandled COVID so badly that I think lots of people like Pompeo would gladto somehow look at origins to just try to distract and change the subjectand get away from their own responsibilities.So, I think, you know, even here in this country, it gave you an ideapolitical pressure is an investigation. We can't get together and say let'shave an investigation of January 6th and an attack on our own capitol.PERINO: OK.WILLIAMS: Imagine what's going on in China.WATTERS: Can I just say something correct something Juan said? The StateDepartment under Trump in January put out a fact sheet that says these guysgot sick in 2019, that was out three months ago. That's not new, Juan.PERINO: Right.MCDOWELL: Right.PERINO: Dagen, last --(CROSSTALK)WILLIAMS: Three months. In other words, not when Pompeo started.WATTERS: Yes, but today he will announce this. OK.PERINO: All right. Dagen, last word to you.MCDOWELL: Trump handled the coronavirus epidemic badly? One word on that,vaccine. You know what, this is one of the biggest stories certainly in mylifetime. And to quote Greg Gutfeld, ""common sense is the enemy ofideologues, especially stupid, lazy ideologues."" And I mean the media.So, from day one, people on Fox and Fox Business were talking about theWuhan virology lab which we knew was performing gain of function researchon coronavirus' which means to make them more deadly, to ramp up theirspread. We knew that. But what was the media doing? Siding with thecommunist party of China instead of a sitting U.S. Senator, Tom Cotton whowas talking about this virology lab more than a year ago.So that's where the media is and they are still doing it. Peter Doocy askedJen Psaki about this very issue two days ago. And yesterday and that idiotsite, what is it, media aitus (Ph) was writing mocking stories about PeterDoocy. And then today the whole White House press corps is like, trying toask Jen Psaki about it.It's one of the biggest stories of our lifetime.PERINO: It is.MCDOWELL: But Trump, bad dictator in charge. Meantime, three and a halfmillion people are dead because of communist China and a virus that likelycame from that lab.PERINO: There's a little bit of that temper she told us about in the a-block.Coming up, President Biden accused of pandering of Vladimir Putin aftersetting up a face-to-face meeting with no preconditions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WATTERS: President Biden and Vladimir Putin set to meet June 16th inGeneva, Switzerland with no preconditions. So, is the media going to accuseBiden of being a KGB agent? What about the Colonial Pipeline hack? Here isthe White House defending it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't regard the meeting forthe Russian president as a reward. We regard it as a vital part ofdefending America's interest. And President Biden's meeting with VladimirPutin because of our country's differences, not in spite of them.UNKNOWN: Will there be any preconditions?PSAKI: No.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: And remember how Joe Biden approved that huge giveaway to Russiaby dropping sanctions against the pipeline that goes to Germany. Thepresident is now spinning it as not really a big deal.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's almost completed by thetime I took office. And to go ahead and impose sanctions now, I think iscounter-productive in terms of our European relations.(END VIDEO CLIP)WATTERS: All right, Dana, you're probably familiar with a few of these big,high level meetings. How do these things happen and should there have beenpreconditions in your opinion?PERINO: Probably not. Although there might be some in private. I mean, youcan -- you can kind of have your own, right, for going. But this will betheir first chance to meet as President Biden and then Putin. I imaginethat Putin is like, yes, what have you got? You know, I can outlast you.And in Putin's mind, he's running circles around America, and especially onthis Nord Stream 2. Like, I get it that it's almost finished. But like theKeystone pipeline was something where you didn't want to upset yourEuropean allies, but what about your neighbor to the north?WATTERS: Right.PERINO: What do the Canadians do? Justin Trudeau is up there like, wait,hello, I mean, we were going to have this. And if the issue is climatechange, the climate is a global issue, right, so the pipeline is thereanyway.This meeting will be highly scrutinized. And for all the people whosuggested President Trump wasn't tough enough on Russia, when you actuallylook at the facts coming out of this summit meeting, that I think will be avery interesting comparison.The last thing is, I wouldn't have called it a summit.WATTERS: Why?PERINO: Because I think that makes it too grand.WATTERS: Yes?PERINO: I would have said, we're going to get together for coffee andthat's it.WATTERS: Yes, maybe some orange Gatorade, Juan. How about a little orangeGatorade with Vlad?WILLIAMS: Well, I think you know, to me, it's not like Trump meeting withKim Jong-un with no preconditions. All Kim Jong-un wanted was the meeting.That put him on the world stage as a world leader. And in this case, nobodydoubts that Vladimir Putin is a leader of a powerful nation.But I think going into this, it's Biden who has the upper hand. I mean,clearly, Putin bet on Trump on '16. He won. He doubled down in '20, then helost. (INAUDIBLE) Now, what's Biden going to do? Biden is going to say,what about that Colonial Pipeline hack, Vlad? What about that? What aboutelection interference, Vladimir Putin? What about the way that you treatdissidents? What about amassing troops on the border in Ukraine?All of that is not something that Vladimir Putin wants to talk about. Youcertainly don't want to talk about it with someone who has the power of JoeBiden in terms of the economic power that we can exert over Russia.WATTERS: Well, I agree with that. We always have the upper hand as America.But he already cleared him, Greg. He said Putin had nothing to do with thehack and let them off the hook.GUTFELD: You know, what's interesting is when the outgoing President Obamamet with Donald Trump, he told him that the most vital urgent threat facingthe United States was North Korea, North Korea which we no even talk aboutanymore. And why is that? Because of that no precondition meeting thatTrump had with Kim Jong-un which removed a psychological barrier and apsychological threat from our country.We all remember what happened in Hawaii and people thought they were goingto die. We don't even talk about it anymore. Literally scratch that off thelist of urgent threats. That's pretty amazing. That would have won anyDemocrat a Nobel Prize. But of course, what does Putin have on Joe Biden?Considering that hunter Biden's actual real life makes the Steele Dossiersound like Winnie the Pooh, or shall I say Winnie the Pee? So, I thinkclearly Putin has Biden in his pocket. Joe could be a Russian asset,perhaps a Manchurian candidate, maybe even mentally ill. We should considerthat -- what is it, the 25th amendment? And I'd like to quote RachelMaddow. Where is Konstantin Kilimnik? Tick, tick, tick, tick, boom.WATTERS: Yes. And to your point, after that meeting, for three years, NorthKorea didn't test a long range missile or a major, major atom bomb. Allright, Dagen, so, big expectations for this meeting because I have afeeling the media is going to just make Joe look like GI Joe.MCDOWELL: Yes, they will try. But in terms of the timing, it's not just theColonial Pipeline hack, it's not just the gift to Russia in the pipelineinto Germany, what about the Minsk's Lukashenko, Putin's proxy in Belarus?The Wall Street Journal editorial page wrote about this, who forced a planeto land in Minsk and then took captive a journalist who is said to betortured right now.So, the timing does look like a reward, a gift, a giant cake wrapped in abox with a huge bow on it. What's Biden going to say to Putin, cut it out,which is what Obama said to him about the election interference? And onemore thing, Joe Biden called Putin a killer. So, why is he so anxious tosit down next to a murderer?WATTERS: We will find out pretty soon on June 16th in the lovely country ofSwitzerland. Up next, Hollywood liberal Seth Rogen thinks comedians shouldshut up and just accept cancel culture.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)MCDOWELL: From Jerry Seinfeld to Dave Chappelle, comedians have beencalling out cancel culture and political correctness among woke audiences.But actor Seth Rogen thinks they should stop complaining and just acceptit.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SETH ROGEN, ACTOR: Saying terrible things is bad. So, if you said somethingterrible, then that's something you should confront in some way, shape, orform. I don't think that's cancel culture. That's you saying somethingterrible if that's what you've done.(END VIDEO CLIP)MCDOWELL: Well, he's spine free, Greg. You have a backbone and you'rehilarious unlike Seth Rogen. What do you say?GUTFELD: Well, I think probably the dumbest argument anyone could make whenthey're dismissing a concern is that it's never been a problem for me. So,I've heard people use that argument when there are true claims of sexualharassment and when there are false claims of sexual harassment. It workson any side.It's like, well, you know, it's never been a problem for me. It basicallytranslate into do not look to me for any support when you get in trouble.You saw how he ditched his best friend, James Franco, who is a sleazy guywho had Seth Rogen knew he was a sleazy guy. He worked with him for yearsuntil Franco got too sleazy, and then Rogan just dropped him like a hotpotato. Not a very good analogy.But anyway, I don't know -- maybe Seth doesn't have to worry for a fewreasons. You know, he is completely inoffensive lately. He's never said ashocking thing in his life, except maybe turning down a joint. He'sincreased -- he's very liberal, so that will offer him some cover. Butthere's one thing that he might have to revisit, and that is the rape scenein Observe and Report which many would say was played for laughs. AND Ithink maybe he forgot about that. I don't know. But that's something thatmay end up haunting him, although I don't think he should be canceled forit because he's playing a character.MCDOWELL: Dana?PERINO: Well, first of all, I noticed that he said it on Good MorningBritain. And of course, we know there's no first amendment there, right?So, they have issues. But also, if -- I'd rather be on the side of DaveChappelle who I think has spoken so well about this. Kevin Hart, JerrySeinfeld, and Chris Rock has also said something. I would rather -- I wouldlove to see all of them debate this one. That would be like an intelligencesquared debate I would go to.MCDOWELL: Juan?WILLIAMS: Well, I think being rude to people, you know, intentionally,demeaning, bullying people, I don't think it's funny. I don't think it's --I agree with him on this point. If that's what you're doing, you know, youhave to -- you're going to have to pay the price.The thing about American comedy, at its best, it does cross lines. Andthat's why it holds up a mirror to American society. And that's why we loveAmerican comics from, you know, Lenny, Bruce to, you know, all the way toChris Rock. That's the best of American comedy.But if you're going to look at cancel culture, Dagen, I mean, you look atit in terms of the politics of today where cancel culture is a biggrievance on the right. Well, Liz Cheney just got canceled for speaking thetruth. Meanwhile, Marjorie Greene Taylor, she's like making Hitler-likecomments, but she doesn't get canceled.So, you got to start and think well, exactly, are we talking about comedyin the American tradition or are we talking about something that's justfits your political tastes at the moment and you're protecting?MCDOWELL: We're talking about in comedy, Jesse, nothing is off limitsbecause humor and laughter actually make the worst situations eventragedies bearable.WATTERS: Right. So, I think Greg touched on it a little bit. Rogen istalking about himself. His pal Franco was accused of a lot of misconduct bywomen who were kind of maybe even 17. And at the time, Rogen made a jokeabout it. And now years later, after the allegations have become a lot morecredible, and a lot more, he's now apologized for making that joke.But comedians aren't complaining about cancel culture, they're complainingabout woke culture. Because woke culture kills comedy and makes everythingboring. Chris Rock said it. They're not getting any edgy material anymore.When the edge is here, everyone just hangs out here now. Or the edges comeback so far, no one's pushing it. Juan is right.I mean Pryor, Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, they're not complaining abouttheir jokes didn't age well. Their jokes aged beautifully like Dana Perino.MCDOWELL: Well said.PERINO: Wow. What do you need? What do you need?WATTERS: Anything. Actually I do have a favor. I'll talk to you after theshow.GUTFELD: I can't tell if that was a compliment or not.WATTERS: It was. Of course, it was.MCDOWELL: I'll just end with this. You mentioned Pryor and Carlin and EddieMurphy and Lenny Bruce or Joan Rivers or Paul Mooney who just died. Thisbumbling bag of cowardice that we've been talking about this segment, hewill never be mentioned alongside those greats ever. The ""FASTEST SEVEN,""up next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)GUTFELD: Welcome back. Time for ""THE FASTEST."" While scientists work onsolving that pesky problem known as death. There's a new age ceiling onhuman life that you can aim for. Researchers think it's possible you canlive to be 150 years old.Dana, as Jesse has pointed out, you have been ageing beautifully.PERINO: Yes.GUTFELD: What happens if you can live to be 150 but everything startsfalling apart at 90?PERINO: No, I know -- that's what I was thinking. I'm like, do you want to-- like, at what point can you say, well, I'd like to be -- you maybe thisage, whatever it might be for myself. Can I be this healthy and feel likethis until like 125, and then maybe that's not such a bad deal. But I don'tknow how I would -- I don't think I'd do very well after -- well, mygrandmother lives, I think, to be 104. Peter's has lived to be 108.GUTFELD: Wow.PERINO: We could be around a while guys.GUTFELD: Wow. That's age privilege. Juan, if we live to be 150, then thatmeans adolescence will be like up to 50.WILLIAMS: That's crazy. You know, I wouldn't mind living -- if you couldsay, oh, you could really relive 20 to 50. But 120 to 150, that's a longtime to be standing in the early bird line, you know what I mean?GUTFELD: Yes. You want to get the stuff, you want to get the extension upfront, not on the back end?WILLIAMS: Yes.GUTFELD: Right, Jesse?WATTERS: Right. I'm with you. I don't want to hit 100 and be blind,brittle, and wrinkly for the next 50 years. You got to stretch the youthout over the 150 year span and make it worthwhile.GUTFELD: You know, I have a theory, Dagen. Would you like to hear it?MCDOWELL: Of course.GUTFELD: OK. The longer the lifespan, the less likely you will participatein activities that can cut your life short. Like, if you're a rock climberand you fall and you die at 35, maybe you miss 40 to 50 years of yourfuture life. But if you know you're going to live to 150, then the losswould be far greater. Therefore, you would spend almost all of your timeindoors in like a kind of a padded suit because you know.Like, imagine if you could live forever, you would never go outside becausethe only thing that could kill you would be an accident. I think about thisa lot, Dagen. This is why I don't do anything.MCDOWELL: Well, I am like -- I live that life. I am -- I never go outside.I sit in air conditioning. I'm like up fur in cold storage all the time.But I still -- listen, I'm about a third of the way to this 150, roughly,and I already -- it takes me half an hour to get out of bed in the morning.The bottom is falling out, literally and figuratively. And I don't want tolive that long. I mean, I'm -- you know, I'm a creaky bag of bones now.GUTFELD: You know -- but what is -- there is some kind of weird secret withpeople who are old that they're just like, you know, there's this -- youknow, there's a study, Dana, that says that if you make it to age 70,you're more likely to make it to age 80. Did you know that?PERINO: Well, that's good to know for anyone. You know, that's great. Ialso, I think that --GUTFELD: Because if you don't make it to 70 --PERINO: We are learning about nutrition, right? You've talked about this,Greg. Like, it's -- -don't eat so much sugar.GUTFELD: Right.PERINO: And that will extend your life.GUTFELD: That is a good point.PERINO: But you can still do a lot of drugs according to Greg.MCDOWELL: No, can't do.GUTFELD: All right, I got to go. ""ONE MORE THING"" is up next. Enjoy it, ifyou will.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)WILLIAMS: It's time now for ""ONE MORE THING"" and I have an announcement.This is my last day hosting THE FIVE. COVID taught me a lot of lessons. Asthe show goes back to the New York studio, I'll be staying in D.C. I'll beworking for Fox out of Washington.

Former FBI assistant director reacts to the workplace massacre on 'Your World' This is a rush transcript from ""Your World with Neil Cavuto,"" May 26, 2021. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: So many questions.We're probably minutes away from answers in that San Jose shooting that hasleft at least nine people dead, including the gunman.Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is ""Your World.""So much we don't know of what was the motivation behind the shooting todayin San Jose. We have a pretty good idea of the shooter. We have very littleabout his motives and whether he might have been working with others.Again, this press briefing is going to be a little bit later in this hour,but, ahead of that, to Claudia Cowan on what she's learning in San Jose --Claudia.CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.Well, right now, investigators are actually combing through two crimescenes, the light rail yard maintenance facility a few blocks behind mehere in San Jose. That's where a gunman opened fire, killing eight peoplethis morning, before turning the gun on himself.And authorities are also investigating the shooter's house about eightmiles away, which went up in smoke right around the same time.It all started just after 6:30 a.m. this morning, local time, when policebegan getting calls of multiple shots fired at the maintenance facilityhere run by the Valley Transportation Authority, or VTA. It operates trainsand buses for commuters all over Santa Clara County.According to one witness, there was a union meeting going on and a possibleshift change happening as well. More than 2,000 people work for the VTA,and the gunman was one of them. He's been identified as 57-year-old SamCassidy, a technician who worked here at this yard.But, again, as you mentioned, the motive behind this shooting remainsunknown, whether he was targeting anyone specifically. Those are questionsthat still need to be answered. Meantime, families are reuniting as wespeak, hearing accounts of what went down. In the rush to escape thegunfire, some people hid out in empty railcars.Police have not said what kind of weapon was used or how long the shooterhad worked at the VTA.But, in the meantime, the bomb squad is looking into that house fire. Weare hearing reports it was filled with hundreds of rounds of ammunition,and officials with bomb-sniffing dogs also checking for explosives andother devices at both crime scenes and say there is no immediate threat topublic safety.President Biden, we're told, carefully monitoring the situation. FBI agentsalso on scene helping local officials gather and process evidence and alsotry to determine a motive.Neil, Mayor Sam Liccardo was here just a short time ago. He called this ahorrific day for the city of San Jose. No doubt about that -- back to you.CAVUTO: Claudia, thank you very much.And, again, we will be hearing from local officials and whether the bombsquad has already been called off in that area and outside this building.When they speak, we will take you there.In the meantime, back in Washington, D.C., and the battle over thatinfrastructure package of that has Republicans being criticized becausethey're being cheap. The idea behind their being cheap? That theirinfrastructure package is only $1 trillion.It is the times in which we live.To Peter Doocy at the White House with more -- Peter.PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good to see you.The first White House offer for this infrastructure package was more than$2 trillion. And officials here say they think they showed a lot of goodfaith whittling that down to just $1.7 trillion. Well, now they're waitingfor the GOP negotiators to send them back something a little bit smaller.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY: As weall know, this is negotiations working in this really funny way. We make anoffer, they make a counter, and then we counter.So, as you all know, we made -- we have made our offer and our counter, andwe're waiting to hear from Republicans, which we're hearing will happenshortly, what their counter will be.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: Yes, and the shrunken Republican counteroffer expected to be abouta trillion dollars.The biggest hangup the last couple days has been how to pay for any ofthis. Some Republicans now claim they think they can scrape together unusedCOVID stimulus money to do it. But the White House says there just are nothundreds of billions of dollars in spare cash lying around.Things that -- things are still preliminary enough, though, thatRepublicans on the outside of closed negotiations still haven't even heardhow their side wants to define infrastructure.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. CHARLES GRASSLEY (R-IA): If it's an eight-year figure, it's onlyabout $100 billion off of what we have talked about before. Some compromisewith the president is going to be necessary.But the most important thing isn't the money. It's that we don't have non-infrastructure things in the bill.(END VIDEO CLIP)DOOCY: The other big story here at the White House, the president told usfor the first time the American intel community is split about whether ornot COVID-19 originated as the result of a laboratory accident ororiginated in nature.So, now the president tells us this: ""I have now asked the intelligencecommunity to redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information thatcould bring us closer to a definitive conclusion and report back to me in90 days.""It is still worth pointing out, though, that none of the intel agencies thepresident is consulting about this have higher than a low to moderateconfidence in their prediction one way or the other -- Neil.CAVUTO: Peter Doocy at the White House, thank you very, very much.That inflation concern is real. It's popping up in the darndest of ways ina myriad of numbers, from the price of chicken to pork or a variety ofother things, including gas, including plane tickets, including cruisetickets. They're going up, up and away.What is different this time is, Americans seem to be willing to pay forthose higher prices because they want to break out of this pandemic. Youcan't blame them for that.But when some big banking CEOs were on Capitol Hill today, they were askedabout the threat of inflation and how real it was.Susan Li, what did they discover?SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, Neil, Washingtonstimulus has been great for stock markets, but tough on consumers,stretching budgets and wallets.And consumer prices, we saw that last month, growing at the fastest rate in12 years. And you're right. The CEO of the world's biggest bank, JamieDimon, says that Americans should brace for even much higher prices, thanksto D.C. money printing.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, J.P. MORGAN CHASE: As all that spending takesplace, but, yes, it will raise inflation. I think there is nothing wrongwith 1.6 percent. I would expect it to go considerably higher than that.(END VIDEO CLIP)LI: You're already seeing much more expensive prices. Used cars went up bythe most since 1953 last month. Bacon prices were up 16 percent.And, yes, meat lovers are shelling out more money. And if you're drivingsomewhere this Memorial Day weekend, you're paying the most at the pump inseven years. Now, the White House and the Federal Reserve, Neil, say thatthe price spikes are only temporary, should come down. But it does riskoverheating the economy, which will force interest rates to go up.And that usually means that stocks fall and consumer spending drops aswell.CAVUTO: All right, we're not at that point yet, but we will see.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Susan Li, thank you so much.Susan Li of FOX Business fame, which, if you do not get, you better demand.She's part of that.All right, let's go to Senator Roy Blunt. He's a key figure in all of thisabout spending and the inflationary concerns that Republicans. He is, ofcourse, the Senate Republican Policy Committee Chair, the Missouri senator.Senator, always great having you. Thank you for taking the time.SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): Hey, Neil. Great to be with you.CAVUTO: You know, Senator, you and I might be a tad old enough to rememberinflation when it gets out of control. Some of your colleagues areconcerned it could be happening again, and that there's something to worryabout here.Do you think that's the case?BLUNT: Well, I do think that's the case.And I think the largest reason for that is just the massive amount ofspending that the Biden administration is talking about. They have proposed$7.1 trillion in spending since the 1st of the year. Very little of it,almost none of it has anything to do with COVID.It just has to do with spending, not paying for it or threatening to payfor it out of a tax bill that we believe was working very well whenever thepandemic started. And it's a big mistake.Let me make one example here. The $7.1 trillion, the normal discretionaryspending to the federal government is $1.5 trillion. Every year, when youhave covered us as we try to move that appropriations process forward, howmuch are we going to spend on defense, how much are we going to spend oneverything else, that's total about $1.5 trillion by now.Used to be smaller. Last year, it was $1.5 trillion. This year, it would beabout $1.5 trillion in the actual budget that the Biden administrationgives us later this week. But in the off-budget spending, there's --they're talking about almost four, five times what they're -- what we wouldnormally spend.And it'll have an impact on the market. You can't give people check aftercheck after check and not expect them to be competing more vigorously forwhat's out there than they would otherwise.CAVUTO: You know, Senator, the fact of the matter is, though, thatspending was excessive under Donald Trump. So were deficits and a buildingdebt.I'm not trying to politicize it one way or the other. But there's abipartisan deal to spend money. And I'm just wondering, does that mean thatyou are against this infrastructure package, even the one that yourcolleagues seem to be embracing closer to a trillion dollars?BLUNT: No, I think we're looking at an infrastructure package that wecould pay for, and not pay for by getting into the 2017 tax bill.Our two guidelines on infrastructure have been, it has to be reallyinfrastructure, the kinds of things that people six months ago or every --just people that talk about this issue would have believed, roads, bridges,highways, ports, airports, water infrastructure, not the caringinfrastructure, not that we're necessarily saying those things are bad.They're just not infrastructure.And the other guideline was, we are not going to get into the 2017 taxbill. It was producing great results at the beginning of the pandemic.Corporate rate made us more competitive all over the world for the firsttime in a long time. No inversions were occurring during that entire periodof time between the time that bill went into effect.A lot of good things were happening. I think we can pay for theinfrastructure part of the president's program, or at least the amount that-- what we're willing to do the infrastructure apart with user fees, withleftover money from the COVID spending.And you're right. We spent a lot of money during COVID in five bipartisanbills last year. But the Biden proposal for spending this year is doublewhat we spent last year, when our economy was truly in a crisis.It -- we're no longer in a crisis. If we're in a crisis, it's likely to bethe crisis of inflation driven by government spending.CAVUTO: Right.BLUNT: But we need infrastructure. It's one of the things that we cannotdo for ourselves.And Republicans want to have an infrastructure bill.CAVUTO: All right.BLUNT: We just want it to be about infrastructure.CAVUTO: It just sounds to me, Senator, that this isn't going to happen,this infrastructure measure, because the president, leaving aside hisdifficulty trying to woo Republicans, he's having a devil of a time withfellow Democrats.Do you think this is going to happen?BLUNT: Well, I think it should happen.One of the things we did talk about under the entire Obama administrationand every six months in the Trump administration, the next thing we weregoing to get to was infrastructure. The country needs better roads, betterbridges. We can compete more effectively if we are able to connect moreeffectively.We need that to happen. The option that the Democrats have that at one timethey thought they were going to use was take this entire $2.5 trillion orpackage, where you had the caring infrastructure, the manufacturinginfrastructure, the helping-people-at-home infrastructure, and they weregoing to do that as a reconciliation bill with 50 Democrats and the vicepresident.If they decide they're going to do it, that's the way they're going to haveto do it, because I think Republicans are committed to infrastructure,infrastructure, and paying for that without getting into the 2017 tax billand costing people jobs.CAVUTO: Yes, but they might not even have those 50 votes, to your pointhere. So, we will see how it goes.Senator Roy Blunt, very good catching up with you. Thank you very much.BLUNT: Hey, great to be with you.CAVUTO: All right, Senator Blunt.In the meantime here, we told you about how inflation sticks. Normally, ithappens when price increases are passed along to consumers and theconsumers this time pay for it, sometimes not happily, but they do.That makes those higher prices stick. And that's why it's sticking rightnow, because you are willing to pay for a little bit more, so you can havemore fun, which is what we're doing getting into this holiday weekend.We're willing to pay up for having some fun.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: All right, here is a sure sign is any that Americans are pent upto get out and have some fun. They're willing to pay big bucks to have thatfun, because the cost of vacations, the cost of booking a flight, the costof a cruise, the cost of a concert, movie, et cetera, they're all movingup.But people are happily slapping money down.Phil Keating following all of this in Florida at Miami InternationalAirport.Hey, Phil.PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good afternoon, Neil.Long gone is the ghost town that Miami International and pretty much everyairport around the country was last summer. Well, I remember walkingthrough this airport wants to get a rental car and I was lucky to see 12people on the whole walk. In fact, we actually shot video of it. Look athow dead this place was.The pandemic shutdown was in full effect, and people were simply nottraveling. Airplane tarmacs became jumbo jet parking lots, today, almostback to normal and full of people. Memorial Day weekend this year fardifferent than last year's.This is America's first holiday weekend with scaled-back travelrestrictions and mask rules, and, of course, tens of millions of Americans,about 40 percent of the whole population, have now been totally vaccinated.And this translates into higher prices for pretty much everything travel-related. Flights are more expensive and difficult to books -- book.Planes are 90 to 95 percent full. Hotels are quickly filling up, all frompent-up demand after 16 months of pandemic. And that's also true forAirbnbs, whose prices are soaring, up 35 percent from a year ago.Rental cars are also very high in demand, and there is a national shortageof availability. Some travelers are actually paying 400 bucks a day to havesome wheels.And on the ground, gas prices are high too, about $1 more per gallon thanthis time last year. And if you want to have a panini for lunch, well,Disneyland out in Anaheim, California, has got a deal for you.One panini, price tag, $99.99, yes, basically 100 bucks for a sandwich. ButDisney says it does serve six to eight people.Meanwhile, I just bought this panini next door here at the terminal atStarbucks, $8.03. That's a bargain. Oh.(LAUGHTER)KEATING: Neil, back to you.CAVUTO: Yes, that one is -- that one is more my speed.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: All right, thank you, my friend, Phil Keating on all of that,although I would love to see this $100 sandwich that Disneyland is pushing.In the meantime here, my next guest of characters and experts, great folksall, but I'm talking to them as consumers, people like you, whether they'regoing to pay some of these prices.I don't know whether Gianno Caldwell would spend 100 bucks on a panini. Hemight. He's with us.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: We have got Larry Glazer, Mayflower Advisors, Kristal Knight,Democratic strategist.Welcome to all of you. I appreciate it.So, Gianno, people are paying these prices. I don't know how many for thepanini, but they're paying them. What do you make of that? Would you?GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes.And -- well, no, I absolutely would not. If I had your wallet, perhaps Iwould get three or four of them.CAVUTO: Oh, listen to you.CALDWELL: But in this case, no.(LAUGHTER)CALDWELL: But you know what? I got to tell you, there is a pent-up demand.We see that AAA has projected there will be about 37 million peopletraveling, 34 million of those folks being driving. Now, the interestingpart about it is, we have been talking about the fact that gas is going up;46 percent of travelers have said that the gas prices will impact theirplans.So that's an interesting thing to note. But what we also got to keep inmind is, folks do really want to get out the house. They want to celebratesummer, certainly the start of summer. And I can appreciate that.But we just need to open up the country so people can enjoy life onceagain.CAVUTO: All right, I'm going to buy the panini, guys. I think we all shareit. It's up to six people. But I think I can down it myself.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But, Kristal, let me get your take on this, because the backdropof this -- and we can get very academic about it and say prices don't stickunless people are willing to pay those prices. And people are willing topay those prices.So, it's a good reflection on the economy, I guess. But are you worriedthis goes on too long, in other words, this uptick in prices leads to stillhigher prices and leads to a problem for the president?KRISTAL KNIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think what we see right nowis, retailers are really trying to recoup the losses that they sufferedduring COVID-19 and over the last 16 months, as Americans have been in thehouse.And so I don't think that these prices, these high price tags will staymuch beyond the summertime. But while Americans are eager to get back outand spend money and to travel, we will see retailers have a higher ticketprice for just everyday things that we didn't really intend to had to payhigh prices for.CAVUTO: I know a lot of you worry about where things are going right nowwith these prices, Larry.But, of course, I'm old enough to remember when inflation really was a bigproblem. We had long gas lines. I don't know if I ever shared how much mywife and I had spent on our first mortgage, but that's for another day.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But the point is that, for a lot of people, this might be a bitjarring. But I can't remember when it was a lot more so. Is it going to geta lot more so?LARRY GLAZER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS: Neil, we have an entire generation thathas never experienced inflation.And, look, the gloves are off. The masks are off. The consumer is ready toroll. Vegas is open for business. People want to get out. They better stockup on the buffet, because it's going to be all you can eat this summer.But, look, I think -- my kids are already in line for the panini. That'show young people think about the inflation thing.(LAUGHTER)GLAZER: They don't realize it.And my son said, but does it come with fries? And the tragedy here is,there's a ketchup shortage. So I think not even the inflation coming out ofWashington due to misguided policies can slow down the U.S. consumer. It isthe most resilient creature on the face of the Earth. And people earned i.They have been stuck in their house for a year.But I think the bigger issue is, they are going to defer major purchases.You're going to see it in the housing market. People can't afford housesanymore. You're going to see in the auto market. There are no cars. Thereare no chips. Bad policy is creating more problems.You're going to see in lumber, construction. It is going to show up inmajor purchases. It's not going to show up in Vegas. It's not going to showup in the panini, but it's going to show up elsewhere. And I think that'swhere we're going to pay for it.And the consumer pays for inflation. Never forget, we all pay for thesehigher costs, and it passes through to every one of us.CAVUTO: Gianno, is there anything for which you would say, all right,that's enough? I want to go on a trip. I want to have some fun.You already indicated you're not going to pay 100 bucks for a panini. I canunderstand that. It sounds crazy to me, but you're thin and fit. I get it.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: But what would you say no to? In other words, what would you justsay, all right, that -- that's drawing the line?CALDWELL: Well, you know what?When you look at the fact that airline prices have increased about 14percent, especially over this period of time, you're looking at averagerates of hotels have increased by 34 percent in some cases, I think that'senough, in and of itself.So, if I want to go on a special vacation because I feel I have earned it,sure, maybe I will split -- spend the extra buck or two. But in the eventthat I really don't have to go, I don't ever want to feel like I havegotten taken advantage of, if you will.So, I will just say, no, forget all of that. And I will wait for the nextguy to do it. That's just my take on it.CAVUTO: All right.And what would you do, Kristal? Where do you draw the line? You want tohave some fun. It's been a crazy past 14 months. A lot of people have anitch to celebrate, to treat themselves. What would you do?KIGHT: Well, I would look at my pocketbook and see if I could afford thethings that I want to treat myself to.I think, much like what he just said, ticket prices really are rising. Andit doesn't make -- it doesn't make a lot of sense to overpay just for atemporary experience. And so I would probably wait until the fall to reallygo back and enjoy the pleasures of life that I have previously enjoyed,once summer is over, once people start to settle back into school and intowork.CAVUTO: All right.I just think Larry's the Wall Street guy. I think he treats us all. I mean,it would only make sense.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: So, guys, I want to thank you all.GLAZER: We're all going out. We're all going out.CAVUTO: Happy summer.Yes, we're all going out. But watch. It's probably going to be a fast food-place, knowing you.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: All right, but thank you very much, guys.Don't forget that panini. You know, panini just sounds fancy. The 100 bucksmakes it even more fancy, right?All right, we have a lot more coming up, including, did you see what'sgoing on, on Capitol Hill today? We told you about all the banking CEOs whowere there. But, man, was there a shellacking going on, particularly whenit came to Elizabeth Warren going after the head of J.P. Morgan Chase.Senator Daines was there, of course, Steve Daines, the Montana senator whosits on the Senate Banking Committee.What he made of today's events and some of that nastiness -- after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)CAVUTO: Why did he do it?We are minutes away from trying to understand how a gunman took down eightpeople and later himself, possibly. What was behind that?After this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA: The access for people who areeligible to vote is paramount to having a great democracy. So, it came outof our teammates, like we make a lot of these decisions, expressing graveconcern.SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): If you're actually making it easier to vote, butharder to cheat, what part of that law was discriminatory or restrictedaccess?SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): Mr. Diamond, how much did J.P. Morgancollect in overdraft fees from their consumers in 2020?DIMON: Right. Your -- I think your numbers are totally inaccurate, but wewill have to sit down privately and go through that.WARREN: Sir, these are public numbers.DIMON: And I also want to point out we did not overdraft--(CROSSTALK)WARREN: Can you just answer my question?(END VIDEO CLIP)CAVUTO: All righty, that went well, the big bank CEOs on Capitol Hill.They're not done with this. It was the Senate today. It's the Housetomorrow.Blake Burman on where all of this is going -- Blake.BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil.Yes, the -- some of the biggest CEOs representing the biggest banks allacross the country testifying before the Senate Banking Committee today.There were a host of issues that the senators got into with the CEOs, oneof them including something that you were just talking about in your priorsegment, the cost of certain things right now. Specifically, what in theworld is going on with the housing market?The question came from the senator from Montana, John Tester, who asked thebank CEOs a twofold question. One, do you believe right now that we are ina housing bubble? And then, two, if there is a bubble at some point, howwell-capitalized are the banks to potentially deal with that?Here are the heads of J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanleywhen asked about the possibility of a housing bubble. Watch.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DAVID SOLOMON, CEO, GOLDMAN SACHS: I don't see it as a bubble. But I thinkthere's a lot going on that's -- that is inflating asset prices, and Ithink we have to continue to watch asset prices, watch inflation, watchmonetary and fiscal policy.And, hopefully, the Fed will get the right balance.DIMON: While it is a little bit of a bubble in housing price and stufflike that, unlike '08 and '09, there, there was tremendous leverage and badmortgage underwriting.JAMES GORMAN, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY: Not a bubble nationally. Certainly,some suburbs look very frothy.(END VIDEO CLIP)BURMAN: Some suburbs look very frothy, he says.Now, Bank of America's Brian Moynihan made the argument that the standardsfor underwriting mortgages have certainly changed over the last 15 years.And he says the amount of leverage at the consumer level is much differentthan when things collapsed in the housing market back in 2008 and 2009.Neil, you are right. We are going to hear from these CEOs again, round twotomorrow, as they appear before the House Financial Services Committee.Like you saw in some of that video there, they will do so once againvirtually. A lot of topics and a lot of follow-up to get into tomorrow --Neil.CAVUTO: Man, oh, man, if it's anything like the Senate, this should belike a pay-per-view thing.(LAUGHTER)CAVUTO: Thank you, Blake, very much.BURMAN: You got it.CAVUTO: Blake Burman on all of that.Senator Steve Daines was at this big shindig today, of course, on theSenate Banking Committee, Montana senator.Senator, great to have you.How did you think the banking CEOs fared? Now, they were criticized evengoing into this for all the money they have been making and the fact thatthey have made a lot of it during the pandemic, the fees they charge andall of that, that Elizabeth Warren brought up.What did you think?SEN. STEVE DAINES (R-MT): Well, the concern I have what is going on acrossthe banking industry, and is even beyond that -- it's in the boardroomsacross America -- is, once upon a time, Neil, we looked at what's goingwith liberal ideology across our universities and colleges, which existtoday.Well, that now has infiltrated the boardrooms of America. If you take alook at what capitalism, you see these woke mobs now, that CEOs arespending more time listening to these woke mobs than making sure they'redoing the right thing for their shareholders and their customers.In banking, they should be focused on creditworthiness. I asked a questionabout, what about lending to oil and gas companies? What about lending toranches? Of course, the climate change folks think they're terrible.And the answer I got was, frankly, pretty chilling. It says, we willcontinue lending to them, as long as they continue to meet their goals herebasically to net zero carbon emissions.That's like saying, Neil, OK, you make widgets. But as long as you stopmaking widgets someday, we will keep lending to you. And so I'm veryconcerned that their ear is more in tune with this woke mob, wokecapitalism than it is with doing the right thing for shareholders and fortheir customers.CAVUTO: Now, I have rarely met a banker who doesn't like to make money,including for his or her own portfolio.So, I think you're on to something, Senator, to say it's not in theirinterests or even in their customer interest if this gets out of control.Do you think it's already out of control? They're too woke, too politicallycorrect?DAINES: I do.And look what happened today with Exxon, where two climate change activistfolks now grabbed two board seats at Exxon. That would be like putting oneof our leading oil and gas executives on the board of the Sierra Club.I mean, it's truly shareholder activism. But it's controlled by thisduopoly that control 97 percent of the proxies in this country, thatbusiness. And I'm very concerned that, once upon a time, what was on theuniversity campuses here, this liberal ideology, now is all over ourboardrooms.The data suggests that.CAVUTO: All right.DAINES: And I'm very, very concerned about what's going on, not only inbanks, but, frankly, across corporate America.This woke capitalism, it's a real threat to our country.CAVUTO: All right, Senator, I hate to interrupt you, but we want to takeour viewers right now to San Jose, California, where authorities are goingto update us on that shooting that's left at least nine dead, including thegunman.(JOINED IN PROGRESS)RUSSELL DAVIS, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, DEPUTY SHERIFF: Deputiesresponded and received information that there are multiple shots firedcalls located from that building. During this time, this was during a shiftchange, where deputies from the midnight shift and day shift were on at thesame time going through a transition into different shifts.Once we received that information, deputies and surrounding officersimmediately responded to the location and addressed the threat and thesituation. They did not wait. They merely went into the scene and renderedfirst aid and rescued victims out of the building as fast as they can tofigure out what was going on.I can tell you, this was a -- at a Valley Transportation Authority lightrail yard, which is next door to sheriff's office headquarters.Immediately, once we received information of shots fired called, weimmediately activate the Santa Clara County active shooter protocol, whichactivated multiple law enforcement agencies in the surrounding counties, aswell as multiple fire department agencies, to initiate and activate therescue task force, which is part of the active shooter protocol, which wewill go into more detail.Multiple agencies showed up and assisted from local agencies within SantaClara County, state level from the Office of Emergency Services, governor'soffice, the California Highway Patrol, and multiple federal agencies, fromthe Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, ATF, and Department of HomelandSecurity.I will tell you right now, with the numbers -- and it's still preliminaryand it's subject to change -- we have eight victims that are pronounceddeceased from today's incident from gunshot wounds.We also have one suspect who is deceased as well from this morning'sincident. I can confirm with you that deputies did not exchange gunfire.And, right now, we're going to preliminary -- go with the assumption thatit was a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the suspect, and deputies didnot exchange gunfire.At this point, we have investigators on scene interviewing anybody that wason scene to see what exactly happened. And we have our CSI teams as welloutside with -- along with conjunction with the Federal Bureau ofInvestigations assisting.Right now, if you're looking for a family member or loved one involved withthis incident, we ask you to contact our reunification center, which isover here at 70 West Hedding. It's located at the Isaac Newton Auditorium.We have grief counselors on scene. The phone number to call is 408-209-8356. I will repeat it one more time, 408-209-8356.So, this incident is going to take some time. And the reason why is becausewe're going to use the necessary methods to ensure the public safety foreveryone. We actually had an explosives dog on scene which detected to --some type of explosives material at the crime scene itself.At that point, we activated the sheriff's office bomb squad, who iscurrently on scene and render any type of suspicious packaging safe at thatpoint.I will tell you, it's going to take a long time to render these areas safe.They have to go through every room in every building to ensure thateverything is safe. So, that's such as in bringing in a bomb robot inthere. And it takes time.So, I ask for your patience on gathering further information from here.It's going to be some time.Other than that, we have detectives on scene. We're doing everything wecan. But I will tell you this. With the training that we have been doingwith our active shooter protocol, this could have been a lot worse of asituation. This is a very unfortunate situation.But with the training and everything that we have with this protocol, this-- this could have been a lot worse than what it was, unfortunately.So, that, being said, I'm going to pass it on to Sheriff Laurie Smith,who's going to give you further information from there.QUESTION: What are the areas that you're covering with the bomb squad?DAVIS: The bomb squad is pretty much activated, and they're searchingevery crevice of the whole building to ensure that everything is safe. Andthat's where it's going to take some time.QUESTION: The VTA Transit Center.DAVIS: The VTA Transit Center, which is a light rail -- it's pretty much alight rail facility, pretty much, light rail garage.QUESTION: What is the reason that Homeland Security is involved?DAVIS: You know, we appreciate having federal agencies coming out.They come out here just to provide resources for us: Hey, do you need anyassistance in that case? And if we need help, we will ask them out in thatcase. So, they're just being an entity to help us out.QUESTION: How many rooms will the robot have to (OFF-MIKE)DAVIS: It depends how big this building is. I haven't been in the buildingmyself, but it's going to take some time. So, we ask you for that patience.QUESTION: Any indication on motive?DAVIS: Any indication on motive? We don't have that information right now.This is still preliminary. This is still ongoing. All the information Ihave is that I can give out at this point. And we're still getting it as weget along.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) search area for an explosive device, and is there anyindication that the people who were killed were specifically targeted, orwas this someone -- an employee showing up at work with a grudge and justspraying indiscriminately?DAVIS: So, this is a big building. I can't get into the details how bigthis building is, but it's a pretty decent-sized building.In regards with motive, I don't have that information. This is stillpreliminary, and I'm still trying to get that information at this point.QUESTION: Do we know if the shooting took place inside, outside or (OFF-MIKE)DAVIS: We don't -- I don't know at this point if it's inside or outside.We have--QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)DAVIS: Yes. I'm going to pass it off to Sheriff Laurie Smith. And thenshe's going to take over from here.LAURIE SMITH, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SHERIFF: So, what I'd firstlike to do is tell everyone that my heart really goes out to the victims.These were county employees. And we're doing everything we can to helpthem, including the family reunification center.But I really want to commend the law enforcement in Santa Clara County.Several years ago, the sheriff's office, in conjunction with the countyfire department, began a series of trainings for active shooter. And thattraining has happened throughout the county with law enforcement and allfire agencies.And why that differs is that, at the time there's an active shooter, assoon as we can get one team together, we go in. The first teams through thedoor were the sheriff's office and San Jose Police Department.And they're my true heroes. There was active shooting going on at thattime. There were victims shot in two separate buildings. But theyresponded. They responded the way that they should. They took their life intheir hands. And I know for sure that, when the suspect knew the lawenforcement was there, he took his own life.Our deputies were right there at that time. So, it's a very complexinvestigation. We now know that San Jose is working on the house fire, andwe're still putting that together. But our detectives are on scene andwe're doing everything we can to identify the victims as soon as possible,so their loved ones can know.So, thank you very much for covering this. And we will continue to give youupdates as the investigation progresses.QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE)SMITH: It's still too early for us to know. But the suspect was anemployee also.Thank you.DAVIS: I'm going to pass it on to Governor Gavin Newsom.GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Thank you.Let me thank the sheriff, the mayor, our police chief captain, all the menand women in uniform. You're going to learn over the course of the nextnumber of days and weeks about the heroism of the San Jose police, savedlives, deputy sheriffs that ran, quite literally ran moments after, secondsafter hearing about this incident, without any consideration of their ownlives, and did an extraordinary job to save other people's lives.That said, there's a numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this,because there's a sameness to this, anywhere USA. It just feels like thishappens over and over and over again. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.It wasn't that long ago I was standing out here talking about the tragicloss of two children, one in a mother's arms, the Gilroy Festival, justhere in this community down in Southern California and San Bernardino.Remember, a few years prior, Santa Barbara. Pick a state, and here we are,in the United States of America. We're experiencing something just notexperienced anywhere else in the world. There's a sameness to this. Andthat numbness, I think, is something we're all feeling, all of us gatheredhere today looking at this scene, listening to governors, mayors, chiefsspeaking, similar tone and terms, expression of condolences, all the rightemotions and perhaps the right words.But it begs the damn question, what the hell is going on in the UnitedStates of America? What the hell's wrong with us? And when are we going tocome to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literallyand figuratively, our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all thehand-wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury andfrustration, more scenes like this repeated over and over and over again?I say that not as a governor. I just say that as a father of four. I saythat as a member of this community who cares deeply about it. So, we will -- we will have time to work through all of that.But one thing I just wanted to briefly speak to is the pain in thosevictims. I just spent -- we just had the privilege to spend the last fewhours with the victims that are waiting to just learn if their loved one isstill alive. They're dialing the phones. They can't find it.They are trying to go on and find a phone of the loved one, waiting to hearfrom the coroner, waiting to hear from any of us, just desperate to findout if their brother, their son, their dad, their mom is still alive. Justimagine being in their foot.I know everybody wants all the answers to all these questions, but there'sno more important question and no more important answers that we owe than -- the victims of this senseless and tragic shooting.And so I'm not just going to express my condolences. I'm not just going tojust express the usual platitudes. But let me just thank the heroism ofthose victims. The fact they can even stand up and support one another isremarkable. What a human act.And so I just want to -- we just want folks to know we're going to be therefor the victims. I want folks to know, I'm here for you, Mr. Mayor, and thecounty, the state.And I know we have elected officials of all political stripes who want tobe here for this nation. But it's time to deal with the endemic before thispandemic of gun violence, the preexisting condition, that, somehow, wassort of pushed aside last year, but now has raised its ugly head again thisyear, and wake up to this reality, and take a little damn responsibility,all of us, to do a little bit more and a little bit better this time, andmove beyond the platitudes and the usual rhetoric that tends to mark notjust these moments, but the aftermath of these moments, as all of you goaway and this fades out of you, and then we rinse and repeat someplace elsein this country.So, again, to the victims, to those that lost their lives and the familieswho lost their loved ones, yes, our hearts go out, but we are resolved tonot make this meaningless, but to bring meaning at this tragic moment inour state and our nation's history.Again, thank you to all the men and women behind me and theircourageousness and the incredible, incredible bravery that was demonstrableof the men and women of our San Jose Police Department and Sheriff'sOffice. QUESTION: Governor, what do you say to the people who say California hassome of the toughest gun laws--(CROSSTALK)DAVIS: So, next, we're going to introduce Valley Transportation AuthorityChair, President Glenn Hendricks.GLENN HENDRICKS, PRESIDENT, SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY: As you all know, a horrible tragedy has impacted the VTA family, theorganization, and our whole community.And our thoughts and love go out to all the employees who have beendirectly and indirectly impacted by this horrible event.I want to let you know that the families have been moved to the familyassistance center at the Red Cross to continue to have -- meet withcounselors about what's happening. We're really grateful of the outpouringof support that has come from union leadership and transit organizationsfrom across the country.The VTA has suspended its light rail service, and will probably besuspended for several days, as we work through being able to get back intothe yard. We'll be setting up bus bridges to go ahead and help get ourcustomers around.We're asking that our customers be patient with us as we work through thisevent to try and recover our service. And I also want to thank all the lawenforcement that's been involved in their quick reaction and the way thatthey've been dealing with everyone who is involved by this.And once again, I want to say how terribly sorry I am, and I want to thankeverybody in the VTA family who's been so affected.DAVIS: Next, we're going to introduce the president of the county Board ofSupervisors for Santa Clara County, Mike Wasserman, and County SupervisorCindy Chavez.MIKE WASSERMAN, PRESIDENT, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA BOARD OFSUPERVISORS: It was two years ago, the mass shooting in Gilroy, and lawenforcement responded quickly, and minimized the number of fatalities.Last year, we had COVID, still have COVID, but last year was the big year,and the people and the county responded, so as to have the lowestpositivity rate in the state.Today, we had this mass shooting here, and it was the Santa Clara CountySheriff's Department and the San Jose Police Department that responded soquickly to minimize the loss of lives.As you can see, our flag now is at half-mast to help commemorate andremember the people that have passed today.It is an extremely sad day in the history of Santa Clara County, but I'malso very proud of the response by law enforcement, and then the VTAfamily, taking care of the loved ones, the survivors of those that passed,and the district attorney's office that has stepped forward with theservices they provided two years ago to the people in Gilroy and continueto provide every day and will provide to the survivors, loved ones, andfamily of those that passed.It is a sad day in Santa Clara County history. But I'm very proud of theresponse, including the unions, that have come forward with funding andhelp. Santa Clara County is a family. And you're seeing that go into effecttoday.My condolences to all the family members and friends of those that passedtoday.CINDY CHAVEZ, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, SUPERVISOR: Thank you.You know, let me start by just reminding everybody that the backbone ofSanta Clara County throughout COVID-19 was all the essential workers, andnone were more essential than making sure people could get to their placesof work. And VTA never stopped. It didn't stop light rail. It didn't stopbuses. It didn't stop helping move people from point A to point B.These heroes that -- we all learned how to call essential workers heroes.We're now calling on them to be heroes again.There is a fund that's been set up for these families. And by going tohttps://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__workingpartnerships.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=VW9t3jvVu5dKgJyYE3T4iUoCsFaQ_XZSOaZAN575-Ik&s=sFNpb-3ZGvCouZzTj2Zw369HrtjIPQ2qLyughaNvrF0&e= , anybody who wants to make a contribution to thefamilies that have been impacted, the VTA families that have been impacted,can do that directly by going to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__workingpartnerships.org&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=VW9t3jvVu5dKgJyYE3T4iUoCsFaQ_XZSOaZAN575-Ik&s=sFNpb-3ZGvCouZzTj2Zw369HrtjIPQ2qLyughaNvrF0&e= .I just want to close with this point.While my heart breaks, I can't stop thinking about what we could all bedoing differently to stop this in our community, so that this doesn'tbecome something that just happens here, but something that should neverhappen.And thank all of you for being here. Thank you.DAVIS: Next, I want to introduce the mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo.SAM LICCARDO, MAYOR OF SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA: It's been said before, butit's worth saying again, our hearts are broken for the family members whohave lost their loved, ones for VTA family members who have lost theirfriends and colleagues.I'm joined here by Councilmember Raul Peralez, who himself lost a dearfriend, and Councilmember Matt Mahan.These are members of our community. These are members of our families. And,right now, this moment is for mourning and for supporting those familiesand friends and loved ones. And we're going to do everything we can here atthe city with all of our partners. And I'm so grateful for how everyone hasstepped up, the Valley Transportation Authority, the county.And to have the governor come down here, he really came down here, said: Idon't need to speak to anybody on any stage or anything. I just want to behere for the families.For hours, he spent with the rest of us simply to be here with us. Everyonehas stepped up in such a tremendous way, showing the heart of our communityand how we care in times of tragedy.Tomorrow, we're going to have a vigil at 6:00 p.m. at San Jose City Hall.We know that our entire community will need this moment and many others tomourn together. And so we want to bring people together to be able to atleast share a common humanity.Particularly given all that we have been through over the last year-and-a-half, this is a time when we need to be together. I want to thank WorkingPartnerships USA and South Bay Labor Council for setting up a fund.And we encourage anyone who wants to give to help support families in thisdifficult time to please give generously to that fund.These are, as Council -- as Supervisor Chavez said so well. These are thewomen and men who supported our community through this pandemic. Theyshowed up at work every day as essential workers, despite risk to their ownhealth. And they did it because they understood their mission, theircommitment to public service.We owe them and their families so much. And I am so grateful for the SanJose Police Department and the Sheriff's Office that responded so quickly,undoubtedly saving lives as a result.We will continue to show our resolve as a community to come together. Andas the governor--CAVUTO: All right, we are continuing to monitor this press event now inSan Jose.We did get some confirmation there were indeed eight victims, eight killedin this attack. And we don't know the motivation behind it, but that theshooter is also dead. It appears that this was a self-inflicted gunshotwound.Jonathan Hunt with us out of L.A.So much we don't know, outside of the fact that there's a lot of explainingto do what led to this, right, Jonathan?JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. And chief among the things wedon't know is the motive here, Neil.The shooter has been named as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy. We do know thathe was an employee of the Valley Transportation Authority. We do know thatall of his eight victims, the eight people he shot dead, were alsoemployees of the VTA.Now, that, in itself, of course, may speak to a motive. But no officials,as you heard in that press conference, are confirming anything about whyMr. Cassidy may have carried out these horrific shootings today.One other thing to note, Neil, is that the home where Cassidy apparentlylived, there was also a fire, which people were at -- the fire,firefighters responded to minutes after, after -- I want to emphasize --the first calls, the first 911 calls about the shooting came in.So that may speak to a slow fuse in that building or perhaps some sort ofdevice on a timer. That, in itself, speaks to what we heard about in thispress conference, that they are concerned about the potential for explosivedevices on the property of the VTA.The bomb squad is right there right now. Apparently, a bond-sniffing dogalerted at least twice to the scent of explosives. That's what gave themthe alert. That is why the bomb squad was sent in. And that is why thesheriff says this will be a long investigation, but, bottom line, eightpeople killed, the gunman apparently shooting himself -- Neil.CAVUTO: All right, Jonathan Hunt, thank you very, very much.Want to go to Chris Swecker right now, the former FBI assistant director.Chris, so much we don't know, but we do now it could have been a lot worse.What do you think?CHRIS SWECKER, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Yes, but it's hard toenvision worse than what we have.I mean, we have a lot of fatalities. That speaks of some fairly efficientshooting going on. I would suggest had be another one of the ubiquitousassault rifles, semiautomatic rifles.We have the complexity of a fire at his house, which signifies to me somepre-planning and some high level of commitment not to come home again. Heknew he was going out today.(CROSSTALK)CAVUTO: Yes, and what does that mean, Chris? Could it also have been meantto divert attention, as he was then presumably going to move on to thisfacility?SWECKER: Yes, I don't -- I think that's unlikely. I think it was done todestroy whatever he had in the house.It was a -- I think it was a point -- this was committed -- it reflects hislevel of commitment: I'm not going back there. I'm burning down my ownhouse. I'm going out.It's going to make it very difficult for the investigators, because, whenyou're looking for motive, you look into their media, their computers,their notes, their possessions, and then that all that is presumably not asaccessible now. They can always get it in the cloud, but it takes a lotlonger.But I see this person as unusual, in the sense that he was committed. Hehad a plan. He obviously was planning this out for a while. He had thewherewithal to make a bomb, plant a bomb, and kill eight people andhimself, without a lot of wounded people.CAVUTO: Right.SWECKER: I mean, from what I understand, there's only a couple of peoplein the hospital.So, this was a -- I hate to describe it this way, Neil, but this was anefficient shooter. He went in and he finished his -- finished off thepeople that he encountered.CAVUTO: So, when the authorities were saying that, as tragic as this was,that it could have been a lot worse, that they were there very, veryquickly, but he did seem brutally efficient on this, it makes you wonderwhether those particular people were targeted.SWECKER: Yes, when you -- this does look like workplace violence, likesome sort of grudge in the workplace. He worked there.These were eight co-workers that he killed. He knew where to go in a veryspecific place at a very specific time. So, I think we're going to find outover the next couple of days what his motivation is.But I think it's going to be related to his work. I think that's adeveloping theory, or that's a theory that law enforcement has now and justwant to talk about. This is going to be the type of investigation wheretalking to people is going to be huge, getting within his social networkand talking to the people that are close to him, because these massshooters always flash red.There's always outward signs. There's things that they say. It's bizarrebehavior. It's things that they post on social media. People close to themknow things. And, often, they just fail to report it.CAVUTO: Chris, thank you very much, sir. We always meet under these kindof circumstances, my friend.Chris Swecker, the former FBI assistant director.We still don't know. They're still asking.

225,https://www.aol.com/news/killer-8-california-had-talked-053257879-154020313.html," SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — An employee who gunned down nine people at a California rail yard and then killed himself as law enforcement rushed in had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago, his ex-wife said. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,"" a tearful Cecilia Nelms told The Associated Press on Wednesday following the 6:30 a.m. attack at a light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority. “When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds. When our deputy saw him, he took his life,” Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters. The gunman had two semiautomatic handguns and 11 loaded magazines, the sheriff told NBC’s “Today” show on Thursday. A locker at the rail yard believed to be the gunman’s contained “materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive,” Smith said. The number of people fatally shot by the gunman rose from eight after the Santa Clara County’s medical examiner-coroner late Wednesday confirmed the death of Alex Ward Fritch, 49. He had been wounded and hospitalized in critical condition after the attack. The sheriff's office is next door to the rail yard, which serves the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of the Silicon Valley. The attacker was identified as 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, according to two law enforcement officials who were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Investigators offered no immediate word on a possible motive but his ex-wife said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,"" she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing and she hadn't been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. It was the 15th mass killing in the nation this year, all of them shootings that have claimed at least four lives each for a total of 87 deaths, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. At the White House, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff and urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence. “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more,” Biden said in a statement. Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the site and then spoke emotionally about the country's latest mass killing. “There’s a numbness some of us are feeling about this. There’s a sameness to this,” he said. “It begs the damn question of what the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Members of a union representing Valley Transportation Authority workers were meeting when the shooting began, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said, but it’s not clear the meeting was related to the attack. The shooting took place in two buildings and killed employees who had been bus and light rail operators, mechanics, linemen and an assistant superintendent over the course of their careers. One had worked for the agency since 1999. Eight victims identified earlier were Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Singh had worked as a light rail train driver for eight or nine years and had a wife, two small children and many family members, said his cousin, Bagga Singh. “We heard that he chose the people to shoot, but I don’t know why they choose him because he has nothing to do with him,” he said. San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez said Rudometkin was a close friend. “There are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family,” he wrote on Facebook. “Eight families are feeling this same sense of loss tonight and our entire community is mourning as well.” There was nothing in public records to indicate Cassidy ever got in trouble with the law. He received a traffic ticket in 2019 and sheriff's officials said they were still investigating his background. But in court documents filed in 2009, an ex-girlfriend described him as volatile and violent, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body weight, the woman alleged in a sworn statement filed after Cassidy sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted. Cassidy had worked for Valley Transportation Authority since at least 2012, according to the public payroll and pension database Transparent California, first as a mechanic from 2012 to 2014, then as someone who maintained substations. Officials also were investigating a house fire that broke out shortly before the shooting, Davis said. Public records show Cassidy owned the two-story home where firefighters responded after being notified by a passerby. Law enforcement officers cordoned off the area near the home and went in and out Wednesday. The gunman probably ""set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time probably to coincide with the shooting,” the sheriff told “Today.” Doug Suh, who lives across the street, told The Mercury News in San Jose that Cassidy seemed “strange” and that he never saw anyone visit. “I’d say hello, and he’d just look at me without saying anything,” Suh said. Once, Cassidy yelled at him to stay away as he was backing up his car. “After that, I never talked to him again.” Wednesday’s attack was the deadliest shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1993, when a gunman attacked law offices in San Francisco’s Financial District, killing eight people before taking his own life. It also was Santa Clara County’s second mass shooting in less than two years. A gunman killed three people and then himself at a popular garlic festival in Gilroy in July 2019. ___ Associated Press video journalist Terry Chea in San Jose and writers Janie Har in San Francisco, John Antczak and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles, and Michael Balsamo and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",2021-05-27 11:40:20,Killer of 9 in California had talked of workplace attacks,,150985,http://news.aol.com/

Offering “one thing that I do think is okay and tonally appropriate,” the conservative co-host noted “an absolute spike of people around the country buying guns” in the past year at levels she said we haven’t seen since the ’70s. “In my own personal life, because of rising crime rates and rising hate crimes in major cities, I have counseled more friends than I can count on where they should go to get training, where they should go to get safety classes, and which weapon I specifically think … they can buy,” McCain said. She added that “so many” of her friends, especially women, “are feeling very unsafe with the crime happening in this country.” Pointing to “hate crimes directed at friends of mine of all persuasions and all different places,” McCain insisted that the Second Amendment “exists for a reason.” She continued, “I think there’s a way to have a responsible and educated discussion without negating the fact that people are feeling unsafe in our country right now in a way that I just anecdotally, personally have never seen before.” In response to McCain’s comments, Whoopi Goldberg admitted she was “torn,” but issued a passionate call for action. “I wish people felt that they cared a lot more about the victims because I always hear people say, ‘I’m speaking for the unborn.’ Well, I’m speaking for the people who have been shot to death,” she said. “Somebody do something. This is ridiculous. There are people who were here today, they’re gone. I’m gonna be their voice.” The View airs weekdays at 11/10c on ABC.

227,https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-aud-nw-san-jose-mass-shooting-20210527-mbu74jrgxva3jgy6q7hyyrtl2q-story.html#ed=rss_www.chicagotribune.com/arcio/rss/category/nation-world/,"SAN JOSE, CALIF. — A gunman who killed nine people at a California rail yard where he worked appeared to target some of the victims, a sheriff told The Associated Press on Thursday, while a Biden administration official said the shooter spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines. Samuel Cassidy, 57, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose around 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag filled with semi-automatic handguns and high-capacity magazines, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. “It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there: ‘I’m not going to shoot you,’” Smith said. “And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot.” While there are no cameras inside the rail yard’s two buildings, Smith said footage captured him moving from one location to the next. It took deputies six minutes from the first 911 calls to find Cassidy on the third floor of one of the buildings, Smith said. He killed himself as deputies closed in on the facility serving the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of Silicon Valley. More than 100 people were there at the time, and authorities found five victims in one building and two in another, Smith said. Authorities do not yet know whether Cassidy worked regularly with any of the victims. Sheriff’s officials described him as “a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years,” which may have contributed to him targeting those workers. “I’m not sure we’ll ever actually find the real motive, but we’ll piece it together as much as we can from witnesses,” Smith said. After being detained in 2016, Cassidy was found to have a memo book with notes on how he hated the Valley Transportation Authority, according to a Biden administration official who described a Department of Homeland Security memo laying out Cassidy’s statements. The official saw the memo and detailed its contents to The Associated Press but was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The Wall Street Journal first reported the memo. The memo doesn’t say why he was stopped by customs officers. It said he had books about “terrorism and fear and manifestos” but when he was asked whether he had issues with people at work, he said no. It notes that Cassidy had a “minor criminal history” and cites a 1983 arrest in San Jose and charges of “misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer.” Cassidy’s ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. Documents show he had worked at the transit authority since at least 2012. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” a tearful Cecilia Nelms told the AP on Wednesday. She said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,” she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing, and she had not been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. The three 9 mm handguns he had appear to be legal, sheriff’s officials said. Authorities do not yet know how he obtained them. He also had 32 high-capacity magazines, some with 12 rounds. In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would have been allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. The sheriff said authorities found explosives at the gunman’s home, where investigators believe he had set a timer or slow-burn device so that a fire would occur at the same time as the shooting. Flames were reported minutes after the first 911 calls came in from the rail facility. The attack was the 15th mass killing in the U.S. this year, all shootings that claimed at least four lives each for a total of 87 deaths, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. President Joe Biden urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence, saying, “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more.” Several long-time employees were killed, many of whom worked together. “Whatever happened yesterday, it shows the character of these guys how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation,” light rail superintendent Naunihal Singh said. The victims were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Family and friends remembered Taptejdeep Singh as a hero. He called another transit employee to warn him about Cassidy, saying he needed to get out or hide. “He told me he was with Paul, another victim, at the time,” co-worker Sukhvir Singh, who is not related to Taptejdeep Singh, said in a statement. “From what I’ve heard, he spent the last moments of his life making sure that others — in the building and elsewhere — would be able to stay safe.” Transit authority officials held a tearful moment of silence Thursday, reading aloud the the names of the victims next to a giant poster board with their photos. “I, unfortunately, get to know personally how these nine families have felt this past night, this morning with just a sense of disbelief, with a hope that your loved one is still going to come home and knowing that that’s just never going to happen again,” said Raul Peralez, a San Jose councilman and lifelong friend of Rudometkin, one of the victims. A vigil for the victims was planned Thursday evening in San Jose. While public records show Cassidy faced nothing more serious than a traffic ticket in 2019, an ex-girlfriend described him in court documents filed in 2009 as volatile and violent, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body weight, the woman said in a sworn statement filed after Cassidy sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. The AP generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted.

Thursday, 27 May 2021 06:30 AM Police and federal investigators sought on Thursday to determine why a Northern California transit employee opened fire on his co-workers, killing nine people in the latest U.S. mass shooting. The gunman shot himself as police closed in on him, minutes after gunfire erupted at about 6:30 a.m. Pacific time at a light rail yard in the heart of Silicon Valley, according to Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith. Police did not publicly name the gunman. The San Jose Mercury News and other news media identified him as Samuel Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker at the yard. Firefighters responded to a fire at a home where the suspect lived at about the same time that the shooting was first reported. A police bomb squad searched the rail yard and adjacent buildings after an explosive device was found. Police declined to speculate on a motive for the shooting rampage, saying that their work at the scene could take several days, assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms. California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference that the massacre was a symptom of a larger American problem. ""It begs the damn question, What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us and when are we going to come to grips with this?"" Newsom said. A White House spokeswoman told reporters that the shooting was further evidence that the United States was in the grip of an ""epidemic of gun violence."" LATEST MASS SHOOTING The gunman and the nine victims shot dead were all employees of the transit agency situated near the city's airport. The victims were found in two buildings on the site. The County of Santa Clara medical examiner-coroner's office identified the victims late on Wednesday. They appeared to all be men and ranged in age between 29 and 63. Their names are: Paul Delacruz Megia, Taptejdeep Singh, Adrian Balleza, Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, Timothy Michael Romo, Michael Joseph Rudometkin, Abdolvahab Alaghmandan and Lars Kepler Lane. The ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, died late Wednesday after he was taken to the hospital in critical condition, the medical examiner's office said, according to NBC Bay Area. Cassidy had worked for the transit authority since at least 2012, when he was listed as an ""electro-mechanic,"" and was promoted to ""substation maintainer"" in 2015, according to records posted by the nonprofit website Transportation California. Last year, he earned a salary of $102,000 plus benefits and $20,000 in overtime, the records showed. The suspect and another individual filed domestic violence restraining orders against one another in 2009, three years after Cassidy and his wife divorced, according court records showed. San Jose is a city of about 1 million people in Silicon Valley, a global technology hub and home to some of America's biggest tech companies. Wednesday's incident was the latest of at least nine deadly U.S. mass shootings in the past three months, including a string of attacks at Atlanta-area day spas in mid-March and a rampage days later that killed 10 at a Colorado supermarket. Last month, a former employee of an Indianapolis FedEx center shot eight workers to death before taking his own life. Earlier this month a man fatally shot his girlfriend and five other people before taking his own life at a birthday party in Colorado. © 2021 Thomson/Reuters.  All rights reserved.

The 24-year-old suspect charged with murder and attempted murder in the Minneapolis mass shooting last weekend is expected in court Thursday, days after a gun battle outside a nightclub left seven wounded and two dead, including a bystander killed hours before his college graduation. Jawan C. Carroll, who prosecutors say is a member of the North Minneapolis street gang known as the ""Tres Tres,"" was charged with two counts of intentional second-degree murder for fatally shooting 21-year-old Charlie Johnson of Golden Valley and 24-year-old Christopher Jones of Brooklyn Park. He also faces seven counts of attempted second-degree murder. Surveillance video obtained by police shows ""scores of individuals"" were standing or walking on the sidewalk in front of Monarch nightclub located at 322 First Ave. N. when the shooting began before 2 a.m. on May 22. The crowd soon ""began to franticly flee the area or duck for cover,"" according to a criminal complaint filed by the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office Wednesday. Johnson, a University of St. Thomas student, and another individual were not involved with the activities at the club, according to the complaint, and had been walking through the area and had stepped out of an alley and onto the sidewalk just as the shooting began. MINNEAPOLIS POLICE SEEKS STATE, FEDERAL REINFORCEMENTS AFTER MASS SHOOTING KILLS COLLEGE KIDE BEFORE GRADUATION Johnson was fatally shot in the back while running away down the sidewalk. An autopsy shows he died from a single gunshot wound to the upper back that traveled into his chest, the complaint says. His family said he had gone out with friends to celebrate before their graduation ceremony the next day. His sister, Camille Johnson, walked the stage in her brother’s place just hours after he was killed to accept his degree in mechanical engineering, Fox 9 Minneapolis reported. ""He was just trying to celebrate his college graduation with his buddies, trying to walk home, and was gunned down on the streets of what now is a broken city that I don’t know that I can go back into,"" Charlie’s father, Greg Johnson, told KARE earlier this week. The mass shooting, coupled with three children struck by stray gunfire in Minneapolis over the past several weeks, and the most recent shooting in George Floyd Square on the one-year anniversary of Floyd's death, has brought continuing criticism on the defund-the-police movement. Steve Cramer, president and CEO of the Minneapolis Downtown Council, argued that the defund-the-police debate fails to recognize the investigative strength and funds necessary for police to piece together such a complex event such as the nightclub shooting – and ultimately make an arrest. ""What's not debatable is what they did in this case to hold people accountable for their behavior,"" Cramer told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, referring to police who investigated the shooting. ""It's a critical function that the 'defund the police' crowd doesn't have an answer for."" Charlie Johnson (left) was killed hours before his University of St. Thomas graduation when Jawan C. Carroll allegedly opened fire on a crowded street outside a Minneapolis nightclub on May 22. 
      (Greg Johnson/Facebook / Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office) Minneapolis officials brought in federal and state resources to aid in investigations amid the recent surge in violence. No arrests have been made in the in the separate shootings of the three children. Trinity Ottoson-Smith, 9, was killed after being hit by stray gunfire while jumping on a trampoline in her backyard earlier this month. Ladavionne Garrett Jr., 10, and Aniya Allen, 6, were also struck by gunfire and hospitalized. During remarks on the Senate floor Thursday, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that the Democrats’ efforts to ""defund police"" has left American families ""facing an explosion of violent crime on their streets and neighborhoods"" from coast to coast. In 2020, Minneapolis saw homicides hit levels not seen since the 1990s, he said. And so far, 2021 is about doubling last year’s pace. SAN JOSE SHOOTER SET ‘DEVICE' TO IGNITE FIRE AT HOME TO ‘COINCIDE' WITH WORKPLACE MASSACRE: SHERIFF In the nightclub mass shooting, a confrontation was captured on surveillance video showing that Carroll and two associates had a verbal exchange with Jones’ group of companions at 1:57 a.m. before a member of Carroll’s group punched Jones in the head, the complaint says. Carroll then pulled out a gun and began shooting at Jones when he was less than 5 feet away. Jones attempted to flee, but was blocked by the crowd in front of the club. Jones then stopped running, turned back to face Carroll, and with a gun in his right hand, began firing at Carroll. The two men continued shooting at one another, with Carroll aiming north down the sidewalk at Jones, and Jones firing back southbound at Carroll. Jones eventually collapsed and died. An autopsy found he died from multiple gunshot wounds, including two to the chest. Forensic examination and analysis of the bullets’ trajectory determined that Carroll’s shooting killed both Jones and Johnson and wounded the seven other victims, the complaint says. Of the surviving victims, the most severely injured was a woman standing near the nightclub entrance when she suffered two long and deep gunshot wounds to her cheek and neck just below her left ear. A single bullet traveled within an inch of her skull, the complaint says. Another man suffered a graze wound under his right eye. Others were shot in an arm, buttocks or leg. A few hours after the shooting, investigators learned Carroll and one of his associates lived in separate rooms at the Comfort Inn in Bloomington. Carroll was later arrested after the associate allegedly admitted to police that they both were in downtown Minneapolis when the shooting happened and identified Carroll in still photos taken from surveillance video showing the gunman. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carroll remains jailed on the nine counts in lieu of $1 million bail ahead of his first scheduled appearance before a judge in Hennepin County at 1:30 p.m. Thursday, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. At the time of the shooting, Carroll had pending felony cases, including second-degree assault and fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle. According to police data, there have been at least 32 homicides in the city so far this year. 2020 saw 84 homicides, while there were 48 in 2019. More than 190 people have been killed or wounded in shootings this year – compared to the 75 killed or wounded by this point of 2020.

232,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/27/heres-what-we-know-about-the-san-jose-railyard-shooting-the-day-after/,"Trending: The day after the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting rocked the region, authorities, community members and families of the victims remain shaken, searching for answers. The shooting, which happened early Wednesday morning at a Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard, left a total of 10 people dead, including the shooter, making it the worst shooting in Bay Area history. In 1993, eight people and a gunman died in a skyscraper at 101 California Street in San Francisco. As of Thursday morning, authorities had released the identities of all of the victims, revealed what kind of weapons the gunman had used and offered more insight on how the events unfolded. But what exactly led the shooter to open fire on his coworkers on a quiet spring morning is still unclear. Here’s what we know so far, with updates coming as soon as we get them. What happened? Just after 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, a man identified as Samuel Cassidy opened fire upon coworkers in two separate buildings within a VTA Light Rail maintenance facility on Younger Avenue in San Jose and then turned the gun on himself. He fired 39 times, apparently selecting his targets and telling at least one person during his rampage, “I’m not going to shoot you,” according to sheriff’s spokesperson Deputy Russell Davis. Around the same time as the shooting broke out, a fire erupted at the gunman’s San Jose home. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said Thursday that it appeared he set an explosive device to detonate at his home around the same time as the shooting. According to Smith, the massacre at the railyard was over within minutes as law enforcement officers from her office — one block from the rail yard — and San Jose police quickly arrived at the scene. Officers did not exchange gunfire with the suspect, she said. Bomb technicians swept the railyard facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible bomb-making materials in Cassidy’s locker, a suspicion that was exacerbated by the presence of wires that they thought could be materials for a detonator. Ultimately, they found no explosives at the facility, and upon closer examination the items in Cassidy’s locker were deemed to not be dangerous, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. What was the gunman’s motive? The Sheriff’s Office wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon that its investigators were still determining Cassidy’s motive for the shooting, but have so far confirmed that he “has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” A VTA spokeswoman had declined to comment Thursday when asked whether Cassidy had a disciplinary history, or if any employees had reported feeling threatened by him. How many people were killed? Throughout the day Wednesday, authorities had reported that a total of nine people had died in the shooting, including eight victims and the shooter. But by late Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed that a ninth victim who had been in critical condition at a San Jose hospital had died of his injuries, bringing the death total to 10 and making this the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. Who are the victims? The Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner on Wednesday evening identified the nine deceased shooting victims as: The ninth victim, Fritch, was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. All of the victims were employees of VTA, transit authorities confirmed Thursday morning. “Today is a day to honor those individuals and their families and we want to support all of our employees who are grieving, as we are all grieving,” VTA Board Chair Glenn Hendricks said during a Thursday morning press briefing. “We know there is more information to come about this incident but today is about our employees and our families. It is about people.” Who is the gunman? The gunman has been identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a longtime resident of San Jose. Cassidy had worked for the Valley Transportation Authority for about 20 years, initially as a mechanic and then more recently as a substation maintainer. Before joining the transit agency, he was employed as a mechanic at a San Jose Mazda dealership. Although the FBI and local authorities continue to dig into his background, his ex-wife, neighbors and court records paint a picture of a man who often exhibited violent and aggressive behavior and had complained about being mistreated at work. In a 2009 court filing, an ex-girlfriend of his accused Cassidy of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol. What kind of weapons were used? The gunman was armed with three semi-automatic handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday afternoon. The department had initially reported Thursday morning that the gunman had 11 pistol magazines each holding 12 rounds, making them illegal high-capacity magazines in California, which mandates 10-round limits under state law that is being challenged in court. California’s Proposition 63 — a ballot initiative passed by voters in November 2016 — banned magazines holding more than 10 cartridges. Individuals who owned magazines with more than 10 cartridges were required to permanently alter them or dispose of them before July 1, 2017 by selling them to a licensed firearms dealer, transferring them to law enforcement, removing them from the state or destroying them. Security footage from a neighbor who lived across the street from the suspect showed the suspect leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. in work attire and loading a large black duffel bag into his white Ford pickup truck. Officers also found additional weapons and a large amount of ammunition inside of his home, sources told the Bay Area News Group, though it remains unclear exactly what kinds of weapons have been recovered there. A search warrant was set to be served at the home Thursday, continuing a lengthy police presence that included San Jose police, the sheriff’s office, the FBI and the ATF. Will there be a vigil? San Jose city officials are holding a vigil for the victims of the shooting at 6 p.m. Thursday in front of San Jose City Hall. Caltrain is offering free rides to the event on trains 260 and 264, which arrive at the San Jose Diridon Station at 5:09 p.m. and 5:39 p.m., respectively. Passengers must tell the conductor that they will deboard at Diridon for the vigil to receive the free ride. On the return trip, they must also tell the conductor that they attended the vigil.

234,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/27/heres-what-we-know-about-the-san-jose-railyard-shooting-the-day-after/,"Trending: The day after the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting rocked the region, authorities, community members and families of the victims remain shaken, searching for answers. The shooting, which happened early Wednesday morning at a Valley Transportation Authority light rail yard, left a total of 10 people dead, including the shooter, making it the worst shooting in Bay Area history. In 1993, eight people and a gunman died in a skyscraper at 101 California Street in San Francisco. As of Thursday morning, authorities had released the identities of all of the victims, revealed what kind of weapons the gunman had used and offered more insight on how the events unfolded. But what exactly led the shooter to open fire on his coworkers on a quiet spring morning is still unclear. Here’s what we know so far, with updates coming as soon as we get them. What happened? Just after 6:30 a.m. Wednesday, a man identified as Samuel Cassidy opened fire upon coworkers in two separate buildings within a VTA Light Rail maintenance facility on Younger Avenue in San Jose and then turned the gun on himself. He fired 39 times, apparently selecting his targets and telling at least one person during his rampage, “I’m not going to shoot you,” according to sheriff’s spokesperson Deputy Russell Davis. Around the same time as the shooting broke out, a fire erupted at the gunman’s San Jose home. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said Thursday that it appeared he set an explosive device to detonate at his home around the same time as the shooting. According to Smith, the massacre at the railyard was over within minutes as law enforcement officers from her office — one block from the rail yard — and San Jose police quickly arrived at the scene. Officers did not exchange gunfire with the suspect, she said. Bomb technicians swept the railyard facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible bomb-making materials in Cassidy’s locker, a suspicion that was exacerbated by the presence of wires that they thought could be materials for a detonator. Ultimately, they found no explosives at the facility, and upon closer examination the items in Cassidy’s locker were deemed to not be dangerous, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. What was the gunman’s motive? The Sheriff’s Office wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon that its investigators were still determining Cassidy’s motive for the shooting, but have so far confirmed that he “has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” A VTA spokeswoman had declined to comment Thursday when asked whether Cassidy had a disciplinary history, or if any employees had reported feeling threatened by him. How many people were killed? Throughout the day Wednesday, authorities had reported that a total of nine people had died in the shooting, including eight victims and the shooter. But by late Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed that a ninth victim who had been in critical condition at a San Jose hospital had died of his injuries, bringing the death total to 10 and making this the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. Who are the victims? The Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner on Wednesday evening identified the nine deceased shooting victims as: The ninth victim, Fritch, was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. All of the victims were employees of VTA, transit authorities confirmed Thursday morning. “Today is a day to honor those individuals and their families and we want to support all of our employees who are grieving, as we are all grieving,” VTA Board Chair Glenn Hendricks said during a Thursday morning press briefing. “We know there is more information to come about this incident but today is about our employees and our families. It is about people.” Who is the gunman? The gunman has been identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a longtime resident of San Jose.

We understand that he was attempting to secure his building when he was killed."" He went on, ""Even in these moments of chaos, Taptejdeep was living by the values of Sikhi: living in service and protection of others. We believe that if the shooter had ever asked our brother for help, Taptejdeep would have gone above and beyond for him like he did for everyone he crossed paths with; he never harmed anyone, and no one who knew him would ever want to harm him.

240,https://nypost.com/2021/05/27/san-jose-gunman-samuel-cassidy-had-2-semi-automatics-sheriff/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit May 27, 2021 | 2:34pm				| Updated May 27, 2021 | 2:35pm  The San Jose gunman who slaughtered nine rail-yard coworkers before killing himself was heavily armed with two semi-automatic handguns and 11 loaded magazines, authorities said Thursday. Samuel James Cassidy, 57, entered his workplace at the Valley Transportation Authority light-rail facility early Wednesday and started shooting, killing people in two separate buildings, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told NBC’s “Today” show. “On him at the time were two semiautomatic handguns, and he also had 11 loaded magazines,” Smith said, adding it was unclear how many shots Cassidy fired during his morning rampage. “We still are processing the scene, but I know to be able to reload a semiautomatic handgun is very quick.” Smith said investigators believe Cassidy went from “building to building” gunning down his coworkers. It’s unclear whether he was targeting specific colleagues, the sheriff said. “I think that will come up in the investigation, but we’re not certain right now,” Smith said during the nearly 5-minute interview. However, a VTA worker who witnessed the violence believes Cassidy did not fire indiscriminately. “I do know that he had a specific agenda and was targeting certain people, he walked by people, let other people live as he gunned down other people,” Kirk Bertolet, a light rail signal maintainer who has worked for the VTA for 12 years, told KGO. In addition to the handguns, investigators working with K-9s discovered found “materials for bombs” and detonator cords inside a locker at the rail yard believed to be Cassidy’s, Smith said. “Our dogs alerted on probably what is his locker and in it was materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive,” Smith said. “And I think they also found at least rounds at the house, too.” A sheriff’s office spokesman had said Wednesday that authorities found a number of “explosive devices” inside the facility. Meanwhile, a fire broke out at Cassidy’s San Jose home at roughly the same time that he took his own life as deputies closed in, Smith said. “So, he must have had some way to set it, or have someone else do it,” the sheriff said, before adding that there’s no evidence the gunman had an accomplice. “What we’re operating under now – but I’m not sure that this isn’t going to change – is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time, probably to coincide with the shooting,” Smith said. Deputies got to the mass shooting scene in mere moments, but Cassidy was calculated and appeared to have a plan, Smith said. “I think he was very deliberate, very fast,” the sheriff continued. “He knew where employees would be. We were there just within a few minutes.” Smith said investigators are still working to determine a possible motive in what marked the 15th mass shooting nationwide thus far in 2021, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. A total of 87 people have been killed in mass shootings this year. “We don’t have that information,” Smith said of Cassidy’s motive. “Now obviously we’re looking into that, but what in the world could possibly prompt someone to take this kind of action? We don’t know at this point.” Detectives were still at the scene Thursday processing evidence, sheriff officials tweeted early Thursday. Cassidy’s ex-wife, meanwhile, told The Associated Press Wednesday that he had previously talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago during their marriage. “I never believed him, and it never happened,” Cecilia Nelms said. “Until now.” Nelms, whose marriage to Cassidy ended in 2005, said her former spouse “could dwell on things,” adding that she hadn’t spoken to him in 13 years. A vigil for the nine victims has been scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday at the San Jose City Hall plaza, The Mercury News reported. Read Next Majority of Americans support trans military members, but ...

According to Smith, the massacre at the railyard was over within minutes as law enforcement officers from her office — one block from the rail yard — and San Jose police quickly arrived at the scene. Officers did not exchange gunfire with the suspect, she said. Bomb technicians swept the railyard facility after a bomb-sniffing dog detected possible bomb-making materials in Cassidy’s locker, a suspicion that was exacerbated by the presence of wires that they thought could be materials for a detonator. Ultimately, they found no explosives at the facility, and upon closer examination the items in Cassidy’s locker were deemed to not be dangerous, Davis said. The VTA provides bus, light rail, and paratransit services and is a funding partner in regional rail service including Caltrain, Capital Corridor, and the Altamont Corridor Express. The shooting happened during the busiest time of day at the maintenance facility, when operators and maintenance workers are getting ready for the start of the day’s service, according to Raj Singh, the recording and financial secretary for Amalgamated Transit Union local 265, which represents VTA operators. What was the gunman’s motive? The Sheriff’s Office wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon that its investigators were still determining Cassidy’s motive for the shooting, but have so far confirmed that he “has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” A VTA spokeswoman had declined to comment Thursday when asked whether Cassidy had a disciplinary history, or if any employees had reported feeling threatened by him. How many people were killed? Throughout the day Wednesday, authorities had reported that a total of nine people had died in the shooting, including eight victims and the shooter. But by late Wednesday evening, the Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed that a ninth victim who had been in critical condition at a San Jose hospital had died of his injuries, bringing the death total to 10 and making this the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. Who are the victims? The Santa Clara County Office of the Medical Examiner-Coroner on Wednesday evening identified the nine deceased shooting victims as: The ninth victim, Fritch, was initially taken to a hospital in critical condition but later died of his injuries. All of the victims were employees of VTA, transit authorities confirmed Thursday morning. “Today is a day to honor those individuals and their families and we want to support all of our employees who are grieving, as we are all grieving,” VTA Board Chair Glenn Hendricks said during a Thursday morning press briefing. “We know there is more information to come about this incident but today is about our employees and our families. It is about people.” Who is the gunman? The gunman has been identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a longtime resident of San Jose. Cassidy had worked for the Valley Transportation Authority for about 20 years, initially as a mechanic and then more recently as a substation maintainer. Before joining the transit agency, he was employed as a mechanic at a San Jose Mazda dealership. Although the FBI and local authorities continue to dig into his background, his ex-wife, neighbors and court records paint a picture of a man who often exhibited violent and aggressive behavior and had complained about being mistreated at work. In a 2009 court filing, an ex-girlfriend of his accused Cassidy of rape, sexual assault and “enraged” mood swings fueled by alcohol. What kind of weapons were used? The gunman was armed with three semi-automatic handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines, the Sheriff’s Office said Thursday afternoon. The department had initially reported Thursday morning that the gunman had 11 pistol magazines each holding 12 rounds, making them illegal high-capacity magazines in California, which mandates 10-round limits under state law that is being challenged in court. California’s Proposition 63 — a ballot initiative passed by voters in November 2016 — banned magazines holding more than 10 cartridges. Individuals who owned magazines with more than 10 cartridges were required to permanently alter them or dispose of them before July 1, 2017 by selling them to a licensed firearms dealer, transferring them to law enforcement, removing them from the state or destroying them. Security footage from a neighbor who lived across the street from the suspect showed the suspect leaving his home at 5:39 a.m. in work attire and loading a large black duffel bag into his white Ford pickup truck. Officers also found additional weapons and a large amount of ammunition inside of his home, sources told the Bay Area News Group, though it remains unclear exactly what kinds of weapons have been recovered there. A search warrant was set to be served at the home Thursday, continuing a lengthy police presence that included San Jose police, the sheriff’s office, the FBI and the ATF. Will there be a vigil? San Jose city officials are holding a vigil for the victims of the shooting at 6 p.m. Thursday in front of San Jose City Hall. Caltrain is offering free rides to the event on trains 260 and 264, which arrive at the San Jose Diridon Station at 5:09 p.m. and 5:39 p.m., respectively. Passengers must tell the conductor that they will deboard at Diridon for the vigil to receive the free ride. On the return trip, they must also tell the conductor that they attended the vigil.

242,https://www.ocregister.com/2021/05/27/o-c-d-a-todd-spitzer-to-55-freeway-shooter-turn-yourself-in/,"Trending: The killers of a 6-year-old boy on the 55 Freeway have “about 24 hours to turn yourselves in,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer announced at a news conference in Orange on Thursday morning, May 27. Spitzer, speaking at a podium flanked by flags set up at Watson’s Soda Fountain and Cafe, said the shooter was a man, while a woman was driving the car. A DA spokeswoman later said the information came from witness statements. “I want the two individuals in that vehicle to understand: this is Orange County, California. This is not Los Angeles or San Francisco,” Spitzer said, taking an obvious swipe at the progressive agenda of Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, who once also was the top prosecutor in San Francisco. “As we understand it, the male pulled the trigger,” Spitzer said. “You killed a little boy. A little boy who today should be in kindergarten.” “You’re going through immense guilt and consternation about what you did and you don’t know what to do about it,” he said. “To the woman driver,” he added, “I would say: ‘You need to turn yourself in. You’re an accomplice.’ “ Aiden Leos was shot and killed Friday, May 21. The boy was in a booster seat as his mother drove along the freeway in Orange, when a vehicle described as a white Volkswagen station wagon cut them off to get into the carpool lane. The boy’s mom told witnesses she made a rude gesture at the vehicle just before gunfire struck the boy in the belly. The California Highway Patrol Thursday afternoon put out a BOLO on the car, with a photo, stating, “The suspect vehicle appears to be a white Volkswagen Golf SportWagen with non-tinted windows. The Golf appears to be a 2018 or 2019 model and the license plate is unknown. After the shooting, the suspect vehicle continued northbound SR-55 to eastbound SR-91 towards the city of Riverside.” In an interview following the news conference, Spitzer expanded on his commitment to finding the shooter and the driver. During the next 24 hours, he said, his message to the suspects is, “I will listen to your story, what your motivation was and your thinking and why you did what you did. If you want to prolong this, try to escape, flee, get a new identity, make it difficult for law enforcement, then door A is going to close and we’ll go after you with door B, the full effect of the law.” He added, “I can’t force anybody to talk and I’m not saying they have to talk. But what I’m saying right now is I have an open mind to hear what their thought process was. But that door for me is closing quickly.” Publicly addressing offenders is an oft-used tactic that can pay off. But if it fails, it fails spectacularly. In October 2011, two days after the shooting spree that claimed eight lives at a Seal Beach beauty salon, then Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas publicly promised to win the death penalty against the worst mass killer in county history. Rackauckas failed, because his prosecutors and deputies violated shooter Scott Dekraai’s civil rights so badly that a judge took the case away from the DA’s office and took the death penalty off the table. The “threat” strategy worked better for former Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona, in the kidnapping and killing of a 5-year-old Stanton girl whose body was discarded in Riverside County. Carona told the perpetrator on national TV, “Don’t eat, don’t sleep, because we are coming after you.” And Carona made good on that promise of arrest. But within a few years he went to prison himself, for witness tampering in a federal corruption case against him. Gascon could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Spitzer has clashed with the L.A. prosecutor, at one point trying unsuccessfully to take a homicide case away from him because Spitzer wanted a defendant to receive a stiffer penalty. The victim in that case was a child, as well. Spitzer also has routinely thrown public barbs at what he sees as Gascon’s leftist agenda. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page for the family topped $300,000 by Thursday afternoon with some 5,100 donations. And reward money to anyone who offers information that leads to an arrest reached $310,000. One Huntington Beach martial arts school, Z-Ultimate Self Defense Studios, created a website, aiden-reward.com, and created 25 large banners that will be draped over highway overpasses in Orange County and the Inland Empire. The banners refer to the website and ask one question: “Who shot Aiden?” Get the latest news delivered daily!

5.27.2021 3:05 PM People who worked with the perpetrator of yesterday's mass shooting in San Jose expressed ""generalized concerns about his mental health,"" according to Mayor Sam Liccardo. The man's ex-wife, who had not interacted with him for 13 years, recalled that he was ""not mentally stable,"" often expressed anger at his bosses and co-workers, and even talked about killing them. His former girlfriend, who accused him of ""forc[ing] himself on me sexually"" when he was intoxicated, said he had mood swings that were exacerbated by alcohol. A neighbor described him as short-tempered, saying, ""I was afraid of him. My wife was scared of him too."" The shooter apparently set his house on fire before killing nine fellow employees and himself at a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority maintenance facility. He seems like just the sort of person who was supposed to be stymied by a ""gun violence restraining order"" (GVRO) under California's expansive ""red flag"" law, which would have forbidden him to possess firearms or ammunition for up to five years. That law, which was inspired by the 2014 massacre in Isla Vista, was presented as a way of preventing crimes like this. The fact that the red flag law did not stop the San Jose attack, or the other mass shootings that California has seen since the law took effect, highlights the limitations of this crime prevention strategy. The same could be said of California's other gun controls, which include bans on ""assault weapons"" and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, universal background checks and waiting periods for gun buyers, and a virtual ban on public carry. (The shooter had 11 magazines, and police said the pistols used in the attack were legally purchased in California.) The expectation that such measures will prevent mass shootings shows how the focus on one rare type of violence distorts the debate about gun control. A few weeks before the San Jose massacre, Assemblymember Phil Ting (D–San Francisco), who wrote a 2020 bill that expanded California's red flag law, released data showing that a record number of GVROs were issued last year. The annual number of orders rose 15-fold between 2016 and 2020, from 85 to 1,285. All told, more than 3,000 GVROs have been approved since the red flag law took effect at the beginning of 2016. ""I'm glad that Californians have a tool to intervene to save lives and prevent tragedies,"" Ting said in a press release. ""The COVID-19 restrictions that kept people home may have influenced the rise,"" he told the Los Angeles Times, ""making them more mindful of the behaviors of others and open to seeking help from law enforcement or the courts directly."" But as the San Jose shooting shows, such mindfulness is not enough, because it is nearly impossible to predict which of the country's many angry, aggrieved, and troubled residents will commit this sort of crime. California allows both police and a long list of other potential petitioners to seek GVROs. That list initially included ""any spouse, whether by marriage or not, domestic partner, parent, child, any person related by consanguinity or affinity within the second degree, or any other person who regularly resides in the household, or who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the household."" Ting's bill, which took effect in September, added employers, co-workers, and school employees to the list. The idea behind letting so many people file petitions directly, rather than bringing their concerns or complaints to the police, is that it will make it easier to identify and promptly disarm potentially dangerous individuals. The risk of such a broad approach is that it makes it more likely that people will lose their Second Amendment rights due to malicious or erroneous allegations by biased petitioners. But so far in California, both the benefit and the danger have remained mostly theoretical. Ting's numbers indicate that law enforcement officials obtained more than 95 percent of the GVROs issued in 2020—all but 59. A review of earlier cases found that nearly 97 percent were initiated by a law enforcement officer. Police can obtain a ""temporary emergency gun violence restraining order,"" which lasts up to three weeks, by showing there is ""reasonable cause"" to believe the respondent ""poses an immediate and present danger"" to himself or others. Other petitioners can obtain an ""ex parte gun violence restraining order"" of the same duration by showing there is a ""substantial likelihood"" that the respondent ""poses a significant danger, in the near future,"" of injuring himself or others with a firearm. At this stage, respondent is a misnomer, because the orders are issued without giving the target a chance to respond. He is supposed to get that opportunity at a hearing within 21 days of the initial order (although he has no right to legal representation if he can't afford it). Among other things, the judge is supposed to consider the respondent's history of threats or violence, his ""abuse of controlled substances or alcohol,"" and ""any other evidence of an increased risk for violence""—factors that presumably would have weighed against the San Jose shooter. After the hearing, the judge is required to issue a GVRO if he determines there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the respondent ""poses a significant danger"" of injuring himself or others. That danger need not be imminent, and it is not clear what ""significant"" means in this context. The post-hearing GVRO lasts for one to five years and can be extended if a petitioner requests it. Once a year, the respondent can ask that the order be lifted, which is supposed to happen if there is no longer clear and convincing evidence that he poses ""a significant danger."" In theory, then, the San Jose shooter's employer, his co-workers, or possibly his ex-girlfriend (if she lived with him during the previous six months) could have sought a GVRO against him, which would have made it illegal for him to possess or purchase firearms or ammunition. Assuming he did not obtain guns from an unmonitored source, such an order could have prevented yesterday's mass shooting. That did not happen, which is not really very surprising. After all, mass shooters represent a minuscule percentage of short-tempered, angry, resentful Californians. Those common traits may be seen as harbingers of murderous violence only in retrospect. Even the San Jose shooter's ex-wife, who was reporting her recollections from more than a decade ago, said she never took him seriously when he talked about killing people at work. A 2019 study of California's red flag law described 21 cases in which fear of a mass shooting prompted police or relatives to seek GVROs. In some cases, the evidence was genuinely alarming, while others featured threats that may have been idle or facetious. Judging from ""print, broadcast, and Internet media searches using Google,"" the researchers said, the respondents in those cases did not subsequently commit any noteworthy violent crimes. ""It is impossible to know whether violence would have occurred had GVROs not been issued, and we make no claim of a causal relationship,"" gun violence researcher Garen Wintemute and his co-authors wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ""Nonetheless, the cases suggest that this urgent, individualized intervention can play a role in efforts to prevent mass shootings."" Given the rarity of mass shootings, it seems clear that few, if any, of these 21 GVRO targets had serious plans to commit one. Prior to 2016, when the red flag law took effect, California was seeing an average of about two mass public shootings (defined as incidents in which the shooter killed four or more people in a public place) per year. Since then, there have been at least eight, or an average of about 1.5 a year. While Assemblymember Ting might see the drop as evidence that the red flag law is working as intended, it would be risky to draw any conclusions at all from trends in such tiny, volatile numbers. Even if GVROs have prevented mass shootings, it probably would not be possible to measure that result with any confidence. Red flag laws, which 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted, are commonly touted as a way to stop mass shootings. But that is far from their main use. While Ting's tally does not include information on the motivation for GVROs, data from other states indicate that a large majority of gun confiscation orders are aimed at preventing suicide, not homicide. And even when petitioners allege that someone is a danger to others, the risk of a mass shooting is bound to be infinitesimal, since such crimes account for a tiny share of gun homicides and an even tinier share of unlawful firearm use. The focus on mass shootings is therefore highly misleading in assessing the costs and benefits of red flag laws. A more relevant question is what percentage of people subject to gun confiscation orders actually would have used a firearm to kill themselves or others. Given the weak due process protections that are typical of red flag laws, that percentage is probably pretty small. Data from Florida and Maryland indicate that judges nearly always grant ex parte orders. In Florida, judges issue final orders about 95 percent of the time. I have not seen comparable data for California, but its ""significant danger"" standard is amorphous enough to allow post-hearing orders in almost every case. Although there is no evidence that red flag laws have an impact on homicide rates, a few studies suggest they may prevent suicides. But even those estimates indicate that the vast majority of people disarmed by these laws—90 to 95 percent—were not actually suicidal, or at least not suicidal enough to complete the act. If you attach no value to the constitutional rights that people lose for the duration of a red flag order, those odds may not bother you. But if you think something important is lost when the government deprives someone of the fundamental right to armed self-defense, your assessment is apt to be different. Update: The Wall Street Journal reports that Customs and Border Protection detained the San Jose shooter in 2016 after he returned from a trip to the Philippines. According to a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Journal, he had ""books about terrorism and fear and manifestos…as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA [Valley Transportation Authority]."" But ""when asked if he had problems with anybody at work, he stated 'no.'""

The guns of the “Red flag fliers” will be confiscated, and the guns of the “Blue flag fliers” will NOT? I have seen NO mention of the “Blue flag fliers” in this context!!!

Its an easy and simple job to do and its earnings are much better than regular office job and even a little child can do this and earns money. Everybody must try this job by just use the info on this page…..VISIT HERE Cue Tony posting about how government is good for us. We need government.  It’s both necessary and the greatest threat to our species. We need laws.  We need contract enforcement.  Property rights, etc.. Human society seems to thrive when we delegate away the use of force to government.  Granted now we’ve got unaccountable thugs who use force with impunity, but it’s better than anarchy.  Especially since anarchy will soon turn into some form of government when the biggest gang gains the monopoly on organized violence. Some people seem to need government more, way more,  than others. Creating is difficult.  Taking is easy.  Government takes.  So it’s no surprise that some people really like lots of government.  Saves them from creating. You just described about half the population. A lot more than that.  What percentage of the population is on SSI or something similar, and how many aspire to it?  When I was a teenager I knew people whose goal in life was to have a kid and then have the government pay their bills for the next 18 years. Yes. Especially people who come from countries with traditions not rooted in Western Civilization. This is why eliminating the quota system was a big mistake. Which group(s) would that be? Cue OBL? That is a legitimate problem with anarchy. Because you’re never going to get rid of the Tony’s or the Biden’s or the Santorum’s. Not without stooping to Tony levels of depravity. So it’s basically a choice between the devils you know and the devils you don’t. I’d say we’re getting both government and anarchy. There’s a term that someone coined for exactly this phenomenon, where the government is heavy handed in enforcing petty laws among regular people but do nothing about roving bands of thugs. I can’t seem to recall it. Anarcho-tyranny is the word I’m looking for. I thought you were being sarcastic… Anarchotyranny is exactly the term you’re looking for. The man who killed nine co-workers at the light rail yard in San Jose, California, had two semi-automatic handguns and 11 magazines on him, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith tells CNN’s Josh Campbell. “I don’t know if he re-loaded, I don’t know the number of rounds that he fired, but of the people who were injured, none survived,” Smith said. “They were handguns of the type that would be legal in California.” They were handguns of the type that would be legal in California.” Sounds like the perfect opportunity to create a new law. Which 11 magazines did he have on him?  I’ll start Popular Pseudoscience, with a Dr. Fauci pictorial. “Postal Today” Seriously don’t know; this is the only mention of weapons I’ve seen; figured with wasn’t anything like an AR of the pics would have been all over the news before now, with the usual “AH-HA” smoking gun commentary. CA does however have a 10 round capacity limit, but they might have been older ones unaccounted for. He likely—I haven’t seen the crime scene—got his victims in a confined space, and made sure they were dead.  It’s hard to kill people (vice wounding them) with a handgun.  But, if you shoot them in the head repeatedly; that often works. Garden and Gun? So they already have an AWB; they have waiting periods; they limit who can legally carry a concealed weapon; and apparently have a very broad and far reaching red flag law, and none of this had any impact whatsoever. And we are already hearing how the rest of the country needs to be more like California in this regard in order to prevent such tragedies. California is a model society.  That’s why everyone’s leaving it. They’re really missionaries, bringing the salvation to other States. Sadly there’s some truth to this. Demographics are a significantly larger predictor of gun violence than gun ownership. “Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to ‘Big Tech’ (the only companies in America that have it—corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity,” the Trump once tweeted. There’s your “logic” from Der TrumpfenFuhrer, and MANY conservaTurd commenters on these pages. By the EXACT SAME logic, ANY laws shielding gun and ammo manufacturers and-or sellers (Remington for example) need to be held accountable for the shootings of crazy users of their products! Remington, exercise better editorial control of your bullets! Hey conservaTurd assholes-commenters who oppose Section 230! Ye moochers off of a “liability shielding gift from the U.S. to ‘Big Guns and Ammo Tech’”… You ready to pay $90,000 per gun and $15 per ammo-round, or pay out the ass for insurance, for your guns? No? Then you are hypocrites ass usual! That’s it squirrel, consider yourself MUTED >>ANY laws shielding gun and ammo manufacturers and-or sellers (Remington for example) need to be held accountable for the shootings of crazy users of their products! the laws need to be held accountable? Yeah. ROFLMAO quoting a Trump tweet to make a less coherent argument. Again, the guy wasn’t a 12-D chess master as much as a borderline-capable 2-D chess player opposed by people who have trouble with number lines and long division. Spaz flag >>often expressed anger at his bosses and co-workers, and even talked about killing them. jfc hear something say something? Samuel Cassidy was a 57-year-old public transit employee who was named as the mass shooting suspect who murdered nine people, including co-workers, during a union meeting at a light rail yard in San Jose, California, on May 26, 2021. I wonder if the Union will fight to protect his job? The fact that the red flag law did not stop the San Jose attack, or the other mass shootings that California has seen since the law took effect, highlights the limitations of this crime prevention strategy. The same could be said of California’s other gun controls, which include bans on “assault weapons” and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, universal background checks and waiting periods for gun buyers, and a virtual ban on public carry. “Well, perhaps such laws did not work in this particular instance.  But clearly they potentially stop *many* similar shootings.  And this tragic failure indicates the need for more targeted, uh, *general* common-sense firearm laws.” “potentially”? That is a really stupid argument to post for all to see. Tinfoil hats can “potentially” protect one from Havana syndrome too. “potentially”? That is a really stupid argument to post for all to see. Not half as stupid as your inability to recognize blindingly obvious sarcasm. Or the tinfoil hat could catch your head on fire if you get hit with the microwave pulse. So, what this tells us is what we already know: most gun laws are just so much virtue signaling by leftist politicians. In part, but their greater utility is in restricting the self defense capabilities of ordinary citizens and creating opportunity for selective prosecution of political opponents. “Even when states authorize gun confiscation orders, identifying would-be mass shooters is a daunting challenge.” Daunting:  causing fear or discouragement; intimidating Sullum opens by challenging them about their challenge while offering some consolation as to explain their repeated failures….It’s sooooo hard.   Don’t worry, Sullum.  Progs never tire of failing to find solutions and making careers out of offering/demanding more failed laws and policies toward a constitutionally unreachable goal. >>identifying would-be mass shooters is a daunting challenge.” basically fucking impossible. false goal. This one is on the democrats. If they were not so set on light rail, there would be no light rail yards, and this would never have happened. Data from Florida and Maryland indicate that judges nearly always grant ex parte orders. Duh. “If I don’t issue an order and anything happens, I’m shafted. If I do issue an order and nothing happens, I only shaft the gun-owner. No-brainer.” Wasn’t the guy treated for depression? I thought I read in one of the news ass-wipes that the guy had sought mental health help. Haven’t read that yet (this is a local story for me). But according to his ex-wife and more recent ex-girlfriend he was prone to mood swings made worse by his drinking. He was abusive, angry and talked about killing his coworkers By the way, what is the State’s interest in preventing suicide? Only suicide by gun is bad, because guns are bad. Dead people (regardless of cause of death) don’t pay taxes!  And they can’t be drafted as war-slaves! https://twitter.com/EricG1247/status/1397621359874691073?s=19 The 2nd Amendment will not protect you from the government. https://mobile.twitter.com/DanRather/status/1397530575045492747 The reality is we have a sharp partisan divide in this country. And that divide is largely over reality. Of course Dan “fake but accurate” Rather thinks it’s his political enemies that don’t live in reality. The shooter had been detained by US Customs in 2016 while returning from the Philippines because of writings he was carrying about terrorism and his hatred of his work place. Nope, no red flags  there! https://www.newsbreakapp.com/n/0aE0LrtE?pd=05vSRvT0&lang=en_US&s=i0 The Las Vegas shooter Paddock also had a connection to Philippines. Maybe people associated with countries hosting Islamic terrorist groups should be scrutinized a little more closely. The 2nd Amendment is strongly tethered to the 1st Amendment and 4th Amendment – which most Democrats and Progressives support. All constitutional amendments can be regulated but be careful when tampering with the Constitution. There will be unintended blowback. The issue is not the weapon, the issue is why does one choose violence as a solution? Banning guns won’t change violent prone people – they will switch to other weapons (knives, cars, etc). Banning guns will very quickly ban some content in movies, music and video games. Democrats and Progressives have historically been opposed to this type of nanny-state censorship. Why can not police simply get GVROs on all suspected gang members? You will notice that there is zero research on how many people are murdered after their guns are confiscated by red flag orders. Sorry but just because the law didn’t stop this shooting doesn’t invalidate it.  As long as a court is involved I’m fine with this. Too bad none of the people killed were carrying.  Or anyone nearby. “Oh look, he’s got a gun and he’s gonna shoot us.  Someone needs to get a phone, call the cops and wait for them to get here.”  “Hold on, Mr. Shooter.  We don’t have any guns to protect ourselves.  Can you please wait a while before you get started?” There will always be guns.  Governments need them for their own purposes and will make sure they always have plenty of them.  And bad people will always be able to get hold of them. By the EXACT SAME logic, ANY laws shielding gun and ammo manufacturers and-or sellers (Remington for example) need to be held accountable for the shootings of crazy users of their products! Remington, exercise better editorial control of your bullets! Hey conservaTurd assholes-commenters who oppose Section 230! Ye moochers off of a “liability shielding gift from the U.S. to ‘Big Guns and Ammo Tech’”… You ready to pay $90,000 per gun and $15 per ammo-round, or pay out the ass for insurance, for your guns? No? Then you are hypocrites ass usual! , https://wapexclusive.com Red flag laws are useless for crazy people and criminals.  Period. ABC7News.com (San Francisco) 	By Dan Noyes Thursday, May 27, 2021 2:59AM “….He says this should not be a story about gun control, but about how VTA treats its employees, and how employees treat each other. Bertolet told Dan Noyes, “We sometimes are brutal to one another, I know certain shops just have a certain culture about them, it’s a union trade deal and it’s just union hardcore blue collar workers and that’s how things go.” He believes that Cassidy snapped because of the treatment on the job. Bertolet is an Air Force veteran, and tells me VTA is a gun-free zone. He wishes he was carrying a weapon, so he could have perhaps stopped Cassidy…” Gun laws are like taking cars away from sober people to stop drunk driving..thank you Michael Malice for that one..

244,https://www.dailynews.com/2021/05/27/o-c-d-a-todd-spitzer-to-55-freeway-shooter-turn-yourself-in/,"Trending: The killers of a 6-year-old boy on the 55 Freeway have “about 24 hours to turn yourselves in,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer announced at a news conference in Orange on Thursday morning, May 27. Spitzer, speaking at a podium flanked by flags set up at Watson’s Soda Fountain and Cafe, said the shooter was a man, while a woman was driving the car. A DA spokeswoman later said the information came from witness statements. “I want the two individuals in that vehicle to understand: this is Orange County, California. This is not Los Angeles or San Francisco,” Spitzer said, taking an obvious swipe at the progressive agenda of Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon, who once also was the top prosecutor in San Francisco. “As we understand it, the male pulled the trigger,” Spitzer said. “You killed a little boy. A little boy who today should be in kindergarten.” “You’re going through immense guilt and consternation about what you did and you don’t know what to do about it,” he said. “To the woman driver,” he added, “I would say: ‘You need to turn yourself in. You’re an accomplice.’ “ Aiden Leos was shot and killed Friday, May 21. The boy was in a booster seat as his mother drove along the freeway in Orange, when a vehicle described as a white Volkswagen station wagon cut them off to get into the carpool lane. The boy’s mom told witnesses she made a rude gesture at the vehicle just before gunfire struck the boy in the belly. The California Highway Patrol Thursday afternoon put out a BOLO on the car, with a photo, stating, “The suspect vehicle appears to be a white Volkswagen Golf SportWagen with non-tinted windows. The Golf appears to be a 2018 or 2019 model and the license plate is unknown. After the shooting, the suspect vehicle continued northbound SR-55 to eastbound SR-91 towards the city of Riverside.” In an interview following the news conference, Spitzer expanded on his commitment to finding the shooter and the driver. During the next 24 hours, he said, his message to the suspects is, “I will listen to your story, what your motivation was and your thinking and why you did what you did. If you want to prolong this, try to escape, flee, get a new identity, make it difficult for law enforcement, then door A is going to close and we’ll go after you with door B, the full effect of the law.” He added, “I can’t force anybody to talk and I’m not saying they have to talk. But what I’m saying right now is I have an open mind to hear what their thought process was. But that door for me is closing quickly.” Publicly addressing offenders is an oft-used tactic that can pay off. But if it fails, it fails spectacularly. In October 2011, two days after the shooting spree that claimed eight lives at a Seal Beach beauty salon, then Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas publicly promised to win the death penalty against the worst mass killer in county history. Rackauckas failed, because his prosecutors and deputies violated shooter Scott Dekraai’s civil rights so badly that a judge took the case away from the DA’s office and took the death penalty off the table. The “threat” strategy worked better for former Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona, in the kidnapping and killing of a 5-year-old Stanton girl whose body was discarded in Riverside County. Carona told the perpetrator on national TV, “Don’t eat, don’t sleep, because we are coming after you.” And Carona made good on that promise of arrest. But within a few years he went to prison himself, for witness tampering in a federal corruption case against him. Gascon could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Spitzer has clashed with the L.A. prosecutor, at one point trying unsuccessfully to take a homicide case away from him because Spitzer wanted a defendant to receive a stiffer penalty. The victim in that case was a child, as well. Spitzer also has routinely thrown public barbs at what he sees as Gascon’s leftist agenda. Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page for the family topped $300,000 by Thursday afternoon with some 5,100 donations. And reward money to anyone who offers information that leads to an arrest reached $310,000. One Huntington Beach martial arts school, Z-Ultimate Self Defense Studios, created a website, aiden-reward.com, and created 25 large banners that will be draped over highway overpasses in Orange County and the Inland Empire. The banners refer to the website and ask one question: “Who shot Aiden?” Get the latest news delivered daily!

245,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653402632/0/phoenix/nation~Surge-in-hate-crimes-requires-Justice-Dept-coordinator-Attorney-General-Garland-says/,"Attorney General Merrick Garland is calling for the appointment of a Justice Department coordinator to oversee hate crime enforcement strategy as part of the government's response to a surge in hate-related offenses across the country, according a Justice directive released Thursday. The coordinator, to be named by Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, will be charged with ensuring that federal and local law enforcement authorities have adequate training to respond to hate incidents in their jurisdictions. ""The coordinator will serve as the central hub for Department attorneys, law enforcement partners, community organizations, and other stakeholders,"" according to the four-page memorandum. As part of the strategy, Garland also is naming the criminal chief for the department's Civil Rights Division to expedite the review of hate crime offenses. ""These actions will enhance our current efforts to combat unlawful acts of hate by improving incident reporting, increasing law enforcement training and coordination at all levels of government,"" Garland's memo states. ""All of these steps share common objectives: deterring hate crimes and bias-related incidents, addressing them when they occur, supporting those victimized by them, and reducing the pernicious effects these incidents have on our society."" Another part of the Justice strategy will include a reinvigoration of the department’s Community Relations Service, known as the “peacemaker"" program which for decades has mediated racial, ethnic and gender clashes. The proposal represents a reversal from the Trump administration which repeatedly sought to eliminate the long-standing Justice unit. For four straight years, the CRS, established nearly 60 years ago by the landmark Civil Rights Act, was variously targeted for severe staffing reductions and outright elimination, according to Trump budget proposals. Congressional intervention kept the unit afloat despite the Trump administration’s efforts. The Justice directive also comes a week after President Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which included provisions mandating the Justice Department to coordinate efforts to track hate offenses and respond to them more expeditiously. Garland ordered a 30-day review of hate crime strategy in March, citing an ""urgent"" need to assess the government's capacity to track and prosecute hate-related offenses surging across the country. ""The recent rise in hate crime and hate incidents, particularly the disturbing trend in reports of violence against members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community since the start of the pandemic, requires renewed energy,"" Garland said when launching the review in March. The Justice review was launched shortly after the March mass shooting in Georgia, where six of eight victims were of Asian descent. Last month, federal prosecutors charged three white men with hate crimes for the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed in broad daylight while jogging just 2 miles from his Georgia home and whose 2020 death triggered a nationwide outcry over violence against Black victims. Three men – Travis McMichael, 35; his father, Gregory McMichael, 65; and William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 51 – were charged with targeting and threatening Arbery because of his race. Arbery was Black. Arbery, 25, was killed in Brunswick, Georgia, on Feb. 23, 2020. Federal prosecutors said Travis and Gregory McMichael, both armed, got into a truck and chased Arbery while yelling at him. Bryan then joined the chase in his truck, and all three tried to detain Arbery against his will, prosecutors said. Garland has characterized the slayings as having ""shaken our communities, torn at our social fabric and undercut our most basic values."" The Justice review examined the federal government's capacity to track and identify hate incidents; weigh the use of civil enforcement authority to respond to incidents of bias that do not rise to actual hate crimes; and assess whether additional money is needed to support law enforcement's response.

X OUR PICKS: SAN JOSE, Calif. — A gunman who killed nine people at a California rail yard where he worked appeared to target some of the victims, a sheriff told The Associated Press on Thursday, while a Biden administration official said the shooter spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines. Samuel Cassidy, 57, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose around 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag filled with semi-automatic handguns and high-capacity magazines, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. “It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there: ‘I’m not going to shoot you,’” Smith said. “And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot.” While there are no cameras inside the rail yard’s two buildings, Smith said footage captured him moving from one location to the next. It took deputies six minutes from the first 911 calls to find Cassidy on the third floor of one of the buildings, Smith said. Cassidy, who fired a total of 39 bullets, killed himself as deputies closed in on the facility serving the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of Silicon Valley. More than 100 people were there at the time, and authorities found five victims in one building and two in another, Smith said. Kirk Bertolet, 64, was just starting his shift when shots rang out. He said Thursday that Cassidy worked regularly with the victims. He called them “a good bunch of blue-collar people” but said Cassidy stuck out as a loner and outsider. “I know some of those guys, they’ll keep joking with you and they’ll keep hammering you about stuff. And if you’re thin-skinned and you can’t take it … I see that is the main cause of what’s going on,” Bertolet said. Sheriff’s officials described Cassidy as “a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years,” saying that may have contributed to him targeting the workers. Documents show he had worked at the transit authority since at least 2012. Bertolet, a signal maintenance worker who worked in a separate unit from Cassidy, said he is convinced Cassidy targeted his victims because he didn’t hurt people he encountered on the way to the second building, where more shots were fired. “Sam made sure he killed all who he wanted. He made sure they were dead,” Bertolet said. “I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breaths, and they were all gone. Seven of them were just gone.” After being detained by customs officers in 2016, Cassidy spoke of hating his workplace and he was found to have a memo book with notes on how he hated the Valley Transportation Authority, according to a Biden administration official who described a Department of Homeland Security memo laying out Cassidy’s statements. The official saw the memo and detailed its contents to the AP but was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. The Wall Street Journal first reported the memo. It doesn’t say why he was stopped by customs officers. It said he had books about “terrorism and fear and manifestos” but when he was asked whether he had issues with people at work, he said no. The memo notes that Cassidy had a “minor criminal history,” citing a 1983 arrest in San Jose and charges of “misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer.” Cassidy’s ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” a tearful Cecilia Nelms told the AP on Wednesday. She said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. “He could dwell on things,” she said. The two were married for about 10 years until a 2005 divorce filing, and she had not been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. An ex-girlfriend described Cassidy as volatile and violent in court documents filed in 2009, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body, the woman said in a sworn statement filed after Cassidy sought a restraining order against her. The documents were obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. Sheriff’s officials said the three 9 mm handguns Cassidy brought to the rail yard appear to be legal. Authorities do not yet know how he obtained them. He also had 32 high-capacity magazines, some with 12 rounds. In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would have been allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. The sheriff said authorities found explosives at the gunman’s home, where investigators believe he had set a timer or slow-burn device so that a fire would occur at the same time as the shooting. Flames were reported minutes after the first 911 calls came in from the rail facility. The attack was the 15th mass killing in the U.S. this year, all shootings that claimed at least four lives each for a total of 87 deaths, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. President Joe Biden urged Congress to act on legislation to curb gun violence, saying, “Every life that is taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation. We can, and we must, do more.” Several long-time employees were killed, many of whom worked together. “Whatever happened yesterday, it shows the character of these guys, how they tried to save others while going through that chaotic situation,” light rail superintendent Naunihal Singh said. The victims were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Family and friends remembered Taptejdeep Singh as a hero. He called another transit employee to warn him about Cassidy, saying he needed to get out or hide. “He told me he was with Paul, another victim, at the time,” co-worker Sukhvir Singh, who is not related to Taptejdeep Singh, said in a statement. “From what I’ve heard, he spent the last moments of his life making sure that others — in the building and elsewhere — would be able to stay safe.” Karman Singh said Thursday that his older brother had “a lion’s heart.” At an evening vigil that drew 1,000 people to City Hall, Singh said his brother “died fighting for others, and trying to save his community, his VTA community.” Annette Romo, wife of Timothy Romo, told the crowd: “I only have a few words to say: Never leave home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye. Because that was the last I got.” ___ Har reported from San Francisco, Dazio from Los Angeles and Long from Washington.

247,https://theweek.com/us/1000898/san-jose-mass-shooting-america-normal,"Illustrated | AP Images, iStock ""Did you hear about the San Jose shooting?"" A few years ago, a question like that might have been absurd. There was a time when it was automatically assumed that yes, of course people had heard that on Wednesday, a gunman deliberately sought out and murdered nine of his colleagues at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard before taking his own life. How could you not have seen the headlines, the television reports, and the push notifcations all day long? Instead, Wednesday's mass shooting passed with little more than a shrug from most of America, occupying a single spot on the CNN homepage Thursday morning, where it ""trended"" alongside a review of the Friends reunion special. There was not even a mention of the attack above the fold on The New York Times' homepage less than 24 hours after the bloodbath. It's no revelation that America has resigned itself to gun violence; as one tweet that has been passed around for years put it, ""Sandy Hook marked the end of the U.S. gun control debate. Once America decided killing children was bearable, it was over."" Still, we've managed to be shaken awake from our numbness before — when a gunman killed 14 in San Bernardino in 2015; when another massacred 49 in an Orlando nightclub in 2016; when another killed 58 at a concert in Las Vegas in 2017; when another killed 17 at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018; when another shot dead 22 in a Walmart in El Paso in 2019. The eight spa workers murdered in a spree in Atlanta earlier this year seemed to resonate for a few days, shaking the country briefly awake again with a reminder that, oh right, this sort of thing happens here. As I wrote at the time, ""The pandemic interrupted America's seemingly endless streak of mass shootings. Will we go back to thinking this is normal?"" Yes, as soon as 72 days later, apparently. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

News By Lee Brown Submit May 27, 2021 | 3:46pm				| Updated May 27, 2021 | 3:47pm A hero victim of the San Jose rail yard mass shooting was killed while rushing around trying to save his workmates, his family said. Taptej Singh, a 36-year-old father of two young kids, had been in the safety of an office in the Valley Transportation Authority Light Rail Facility — but raced out to help when he heard gunfire early Wednesday, his family told the Mercury News. “He was running around the building to save others’ lives,” his uncle, Sakhwant Dhillon, told the paper of what was relayed to them by survivors who remained in the office. “He told people, ‘be careful, hide,’ ” Dhillon said of his nephew, calling him a “good person” who “helped everybody.” Just before Singh was one of nine shot dead, he “put a lady in a control room to hide,” his brother, Bagga Singh, told the paper. “He saved her and rushed down the stairway,” the brother said — referring to the spot where the family was told Singh was finally confronted and killed. “He should have saved his life, too. We lost a good person,” he said of his brother, the married father of a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter. Singh, who was born in India, had worked for the VTA for about 9 years, his family said. He was confirmed late Wednesday as being among nine staffers killed by 57-year-old maintenance worker Samuel Cassidy, who went on the rampage with two semiautomatic handguns just after 6:30 a.m. that day. Survivor Kirk Bertolet told KGO how he heard “several bursts” of gunfire. “It was a series of shots, then another series of shots and another series of shots,” he recalled, saying that when he emerged he “saw a mass of bodies,” including some he saw “take their last breath.” “I do know that he had a specific agenda and was targeting certain people,” Bertolet insisted. “He walked by people, let other people live as he gunned down other people.” However, authorities said it’s unclear whether he was targeting specific colleagues. “I think that will come up in the investigation, but we’re not certain right now,” Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith told NBC’s “Today” show. Bertolet said he believes the killer snapped at how he was treated by some fellow workers, saying, “We sometimes are brutal to one another.” The Air Force veteran also bemoaned the fact that the VTA complex is a gun-free zone, suggesting it hindered chances of stopping the slaughter. Cassidy also killed Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63.

250,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/27/us/san-jose-shooting/union-leader-we-will-never-know-what-motivated-the-gunman-to-target-colleagues,"The gunman targeted his co-workers at a transit agency, killing nine of them, the Santa Clara County sheriff said. Border officials once found writing by the gunman about how he hated his workplace. ‘He is the hero.’ A San Jose survivor says a call from one of the victims saved his life. ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. Union leader: ‘We will never know’ what motivated the gunman to target colleagues. The gunman’s ex-wife said he had complained about his co-workers years ago. At memorial vigil, signs for gun control and ‘Prayers 4 San Jose.’ The municipal transit worker who the police say shot and killed nine of his colleagues at a rail yard in San Jose was stopped by border officials in 2016, during which they searched his bags and found writings about how he hated the agency he worked for, according to an official who described a message that was circulated within the Homeland Security Department after Wednesday’s shooting. The gunman, who the authorities said killed himself and was identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, was stopped by Customs and Border Protection officials in August 2016 as he returned from a trip to the Philippines, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. In addition to the notebook with writings about how he hated the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, where he worked, the officials also found books about terrorism and manifestoes, the official said. The police in California said on Thursday that they were still trying to understand what led to the shooting, but that they had discovered more firepower at the scene than they had initially reported. Three semiautomatic handguns were found at the scene, as were 32 high-capacity magazines which each held a dozen nine-millimeter rounds, said Deputy Cian Jackson, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. He said at least one witness had reported that the gunman told someone at the scene that he was not going to hurt them, suggesting that he may have selected his victims. Detectives were continuing to interview witnesses on Thursday to try to understand what had happened, though a statement from the sheriff’s office said the gunman had been “a highly disgruntled V.T.A. employee for many years.” “The general vibe we get is that he didn’t like anybody and nobody really liked him,” Deputy Jackson said in an interview. He added that the police had feared that there was an explosive device in the gunman’s locker at work, but that none was discovered. He declined to comment on the report of the 2016 stop by border officials, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Homeland Security Department, which includes Customs and Border Protection, also declined to comment on the stop and did not respond to a question about whether the border agency had shared information about it at the time. The gunman had carried out the rampage early on Wednesday morning at the same time that his house was erupting in flames more than eight miles away. Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters that based on photographs of at least two of the guns, they appeared to be legal to buy in California, though she did not say whether Mr. Cassidy had purchased them legally. Californians voted in 2016 to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, as the gunman’s did, but it was blocked from going into effect by a judge after a lawsuit by the National Rifle Association. A legal battle over the law is ongoing. Sheriff Smith said the gunman had been “very deliberate” in killing his colleagues at the transit agency near downtown San Jose, and that he had killed himself as deputies rushed into the rail yard from their headquarters next door. Sheriff Smith said on NBC’s “Today” show that the fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was first reported three minutes after someone had called 911 to report gunfire at the rail yard, suggesting that he may have set off “some kind of device” to start the blaze as he opened fire. She said investigators had found “explosive materials” at the suspect’s home. — Eileen Sullivan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Shawn Hubler and Thomas Fuller The phone call came at 6:36 a.m. and lasted for 44 seconds. Sukhvir Singh, a mechanic at the rail yard where nine of his colleagues were killed, says the call on Wednesday morning was the difference between life and death for him and a half dozen co-workers. On the line was a colleague, Taptejdeep Singh, with an urgent warning. “He was talking quite fast,” Sukhvir Singh said. “He said, ‘Hey! There’s an active shooter. Get out.’” Sukhvir Singh, who specializes in repairing and maintaining the light-rail trains that run through San Jose, fled with his crew members to a windowless building that houses antique rolling stock. There they waited until sheriff’s deputies arrived. The man who made the call was killed by the gunman. Sukhvir Singh said he was told that his body was discovered on a staircase. Few employees at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the agency where the shooting took place, have told their stories of survival. Outside a union hall on Thursday, rank-and-file members said they had been told they would be fired if they spoke to reporters. Sukhvir Singh said he wanted to speak out as a tribute to Taptejdeep Singh, whom he described as an unfailingly gracious and helpful colleague. The two men are not related. “There are still people out there who want to help others more than themselves,” he said. “He is the hero for everyone.” The killing of Taptejdeep Singh, he said, also underlined the senselessness of the shooting. He said the gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, barely knew Taptejdeep Singh. They worked in different departments. Mr. Cassidy worked in Building B, which handles the maintenance of electrical substations. Taptejdeep Singh was a light-rail operator who when he was not driving trains was in Building A, where trains were serviced. “They didn’t have any connection at all,” he said. For a time Sukhvir Singh worked in the same building as Mr. Cassidy. He would pass him in the halls and say hello. At best Mr. Cassidy would acknowledge him with a grunt, he said. “He didn’t really communicate with other people,” he said. “He was in his own world.” — Thomas Fuller Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright A leader in a labor group that represents the workers killed at the rail yard in San Jose this week expressed frustration and bewilderment about the gunman’s motives on Thursday. “No issues that we know of that were red flags — but what is a red flag?” said Arturo Aguilar, chairman of the California Conference Board of the Amalgamated Transit Union, in an interview on the lawn outside the union’s San Jose office. “We are not trained to analyze co-workers.” Mr. Aguilar said the union did not see patterns in which of his colleagues that Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, chose to shoot. The nine victims who were killed on Wednesday came from various departments, he said. “We don’t know the relationships or the correlations between the victims and the shooter,” Mr. Aguilar said. “And we will never know.” The union’s main task right now, Mr. Aguilar said, was consoling members, many of whom gathered at the union’s office on Thursday. — Thomas Fuller The ex-wife of the man who fatally shot nine people at a San Jose rail yard this week said he grew angrier during their 10-year marriage and had complained about his co-workers, saying, “I wish I could kill them.” The gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, and his ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, 64, divorced in the mid-2000s, she said in an interview, and had not spoken in 13 years. Ms. Nelms said that Mr. Cassidy, who proposed three months after they met in a nightclub in Cupertino, was initially the perfect husband. She said he loved pets — including several boa constrictors — and swam at a nearby gym. “He was a good guy, very affectionate, thoughtful, polite,” she recalled. But over the years, Ms. Nelms said, Mr. Cassidy’s personality changed. He grew meaner, angrier and more impatient, hating when her family members dropped by their home unannounced. “It was escalating, little by little,” she said. “Every time we had an argument, he would start yelling and screaming, hitting the walls, banging the table, slamming the door. Very intimidating.” Eventually, the arguing became too much, and the couple divorced. Ms. Nelms said Mr. Cassidy took medication for depression and had complained about his co-workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, grumbling that some were lazy or had easier jobs than he did. Occasionally, she said, Mr. Cassidy would say, “I wish I could kill them.” But she did not think he was serious at the time, and said she was shocked when she heard that Mr. Cassidy had killed several of his colleagues. “That was the last thing I would think he would do,” Ms. Nelms said. “I was just shaking.” One thing in particular made no sense to her. Mr. Cassidy, she said, had never expressed any interest in guns. — Kellen Browning transcript “Today, we’re here together as one community. We’re here because members of our community, our colleagues, our family members, our friends, our loved ones are suffering, and each of us feels our own pain as well.” “Paul was a wonderful husband and father, who was full of love. All of you who know him knows he’s full of jokes. He has energy for life, and always up for new adventures. I will treasure all our memories. He was a great friend, son, mentor to all. He was so proud of being an employee at V.T.A., and all the accomplishments he made here.” “Whatever you need to do to get some support. I know I need it myself, but these aren’t names to us. These are people we know and we love. And we’ve seen every single day of our working lives. And it really, really hurts down to the very core of our souls. So please, A.T.U., let’s do what we do and stand with each other for each other by each other.” “I only have a few words to say. Never leave home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye. Because that one was the last I got.” SAN JOSE, Calif. — Hundreds of people gathered in a plaza outside the San Jose City Hall rotunda on Thursday evening to memorialize the nine transit authority employees who were killed by a co-worker at a rail yard the day before. Some arrived holding signs calling for gun control or offering “prayers 4 San Jose.” Others wore union pins, shirts and masks. A few held flowers. Family members crumpled to the ground in front of a memorial for the victims, an arrangement of bouquets, wreaths, American flags, photos and hats for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Mayor Sam Liccardo and other officials spoke, but most in the crowd were too far away to hear what was said. When the microphones failed, many people pulled out their phones and listened to a stream of the speeches on Facebook. Some cried silently. “Tonight, we’re united in our commitment to our diverse community, where we prioritize togetherness over division, hope over fear, progress over violence,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren, one of the speakers. “We don’t have to be the only country on earth where mass shootings are a near-daily occurrence.” A memorial for the nine VTA employees. pic.twitter.com/lNamd7s2VV In front of flags flying at half-staff, transit workers gathered. Some knew the victims and were at the rail yard at the time of the shooting. Most declined to speak about the attack. Walter Hale, a V.T.A. employee, said that when he heard the news Wednesday, “I was done, I was destroyed.” But on Thursday, he said, “I knew I needed to be here with my brothers and sisters.” — Kellen Browning Investigators do not yet know whether the victims of Wednesday’s shooting at a rail yard in San Jose were specifically targeted, and they have not identified a motive for the gunman, Laurie Smith, the sheriff of Santa Clara County, said in an interview Thursday morning on NBC’s “Today.” “What in the world could possibly prompt someone to take this kind of action?” she said. “We don’t know at this point.” Officers confronted Samuel James Cassidy, whom California law enforcement officials identified as the gunman, “within a few minutes,” Sheriff Smith said, suggesting the carnage could have been worse if they had not arrived quickly. The sheriff’s office headquarters is next door to the rail yard. Mr. Cassidy carried two semiautomatic handguns and had 11 loaded magazines, she said, adding that police dogs at the scene found materials for bombs in what investigators believe to be his locker. Investigators are also looking into how a fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was apparently started while he was carrying out the attack. The police received the first report of shots fired at 6:34 a.m., and the call reporting the fire came in at 6:37 a.m. “What we’re operating under now, but I’m not sure that this isn’t going to change, is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time, probably to coincide with the shooting,” she said. The nine victims of the shooting were spread over two buildings, she said. “He was very deliberate, very fast,” she said. “He knew where employees would be.” — Daniel Victor Everything was set for an ordinary day in a suburban corner of southeastern San Jose on Wednesday. Doug Suh had an early golf game scheduled. Andy and Alice Abad were preparing for a morning doctor’s appointment. And Anthony Nguyen was, as always, set for his daily 9:30 a.m. church service. But by early afternoon, each resident of the neighborhood discovered in their own way that something had gone very wrong. Early on Wednesday, Abad watched from his kitchen as a funnel of smoke and flames poured from a home one block away. Suh got a call from a friend on the golf course about a man who had killed eight workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard. (It would later become nine.) And Nguyen got a similar call from a friend but with a more disturbing detail: “The man who did it was your neighbor,” Nguyen’s friend told him. By noon, their neighborhood was swarming with multiple fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights in the cul-de-sacs of what they all described as a quiet suburban neighborhood that is home largely to Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. Investigators on Thursday morning were still piecing together the havoc unleashed the day before. The suspect in the shooting, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade, lived in a one-story home with white trim and a patchy lawn. (Mr. Cassidy lived near the Evergreen neighborhood, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Officials said Wednesday that they believed Cassidy was responsible for both setting his home on fire and then proceeding to shoot his colleagues at his workplace, the railway yard eight miles from where he lived. Suh, who lives across the street from the suspect, scanned through his security camera footage when he returned home from his golf game. The camera captured Cassidy at 5:40 a.m. loading his white pickup truck with a black bag. He was wearing a uniform with reflective stripes. Nguyen, a retired real estate broker who has lived in San Jose for the past four decades, said he was baffled by what had happened. “Everything has been very perfect,” he said of his neighborhood. “People are nice and quiet here.” When he saw flashing lights on the corner of his street on Wednesday, he assumed there had been a traffic accident. Then his friend called with the news about the shooting. “What about all these families that lost sons and fathers?” Mr. Nguyen asked in his driveway. “I’m so sorry for them. It’s not right. All these broken hearts.” — Thomas Fuller California has some of the most progressive gun laws in the country and is one of two states to receive a full A rating from the Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun reform. The state requires universal background checks for gun owners and restrictions on the size of magazines, along with other laws that restrict the types of firearms that a person can legally purchase. But after a mass shooting on Wednesday that claimed nine lives at a San Jose rail yard, politicians including Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Biden urged lawmakers to take further action in legislating firearms. In a statement, Mr. Biden urged Congress to “heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence.” It is unclear what type of weapons were used by the gunman, whose body was found at the scene, where he had acquired them, or whether they would have met California’s legal standards. The state bans the possession of assault weapons, with some exceptions, and bans so-called ghost guns, which are typically assembled by an individual and do not contain a serial number. According to the Giffords Law Center, which also gives an A rating to New Jersey, California has the seventh-lowest rate of gun deaths in the country, and has the most robust system for taking guns from people who are barred from having them. At least one of California’s gun laws is being challenged in court. In August 2020, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a state law that banned the possession of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. In February, however, the court said it would reconsider that decision. — Will Wright The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped. They just weren’t as public. The Gun Violence Archive counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019. — Derrick Bryson Taylor and Daniel Victor",2021-05-27 15:48:12,Union leader: ‘We will never know’ what motivated the gunman to target colleagues.,,1,http://nytimes.com

But the new Israeli thriller Black Space pulls no punches in that regard, starting right away with a school shooting, and then having its main character try to figure out if it was an inside job. More below… Opening Shot: Scenes of Heritage High School in Israel. The principal, Hanoch Tavor (Shai Avivi) starts talking to an assembly of 12th graders during a Memorial Day assembly. The Gist: During the assembly, four people in jumpsuits and unicorn masks walk into the room, guns drawn, and start shooting. As the kids and faculty scramble for cover, the guard, who’s locked out, calls for police backup. While at the eye doctor for treatment on an infection around his glass eye, Rami Davidi (Guri Alfi), a Special Investigations detective, gets an alert about the shooting. It just happens to be at the high school he attended when he was a teenager. He immediately drives to the scene, despite his blurry good eye. He immediately suggests to patrol cops at the scene to go in through the bomb shelter underneath the school. As the team makes their way up, they find four teens dead, and the rest either hiding, injured or trying to escape. He takes the lead on the investigation, staying there when his pregnant wife Miri (Meirav Shirom) calls to tell him that she feels some pain. He snippily tells her to have her mom take her to the ER, then sees something: Palestinian names in the entrance register, for the purpose of AC maintenance. With the officer in charge, Noga Ruso (Assi Levy), he and a team charge up to the roof and find the three workers hiding there. They’re immediately arrested, with the thought that they did the shootings for political reasons. But there are no guns, and other pieces of evidence don’t add up for Davidi. One of the students, Shir Tadmor (Gily Itskovitch) finds that her brother Tom (Yehonatan Vilozny) made it, but his best friend was killed right in front of him. Another girl, the tattooed Maayan (Hadas Jade Sakori) bolts out to find her boyfriend, who says he was in the building at the time but wasn’t. After he gets home for the night, seeing the surviving students already keeping vigil outside the gates of the school, Davidi comes to a realization. He calls Russo and says that he’s confident that the Palestinian workers didn’t do the shooting, but the students did. That means the number of suspects shoots up from 3 to over 400. What Shows Will It Remind You Of? Black Space is a psychological thriller with some political overtones, much in the Homeland or 24 model, but it’s mostly going to deal with a secret society among teens in this small high school, so it plays more like Euphoria, with violence subbing for partying. Our Take: Creators Anat Gafni and Sahar Shavit have certainly set up an intriguing story in the first episode of Black Space. They don’t spare any brutality in showing the beginnings of the school shooting and its aftermath; Netflix even displayed a trigger warning about the violence before the episode starts. But just when you think the show is going to take what’s a more conventional direction, especially in that region of the world — it was terrorism! — Davidi’s instincts pretty quickly tell him it’s something else. And that’s where the intrigue begins. At the very least, Davidi is going to dig into the student culture at the school, and a social media app named Blackspace that the “olds” know nothing about. There, he’ll find out what everyone is into there, and as we see in the season’s coming attractions, there will be a lot of statements like “teens aren’t like they used to be.” More of the motivations of certain students will be revealed. Perhaps the four students killed were actually targeted instead of randomly shot. Perhaps something else was at play. Because this is taking place at Davidi’s high school, it’s pretty inevitable that we’ll see flashbacks that establish Davidi’s gruff demeanor, maybe even tell us how he initially lost his eye. Will those flashbacks be any kind of help in unlocking the case? Maybe not. But it’ll likely speak to Davidi’s motivation to solving it and why he’s so sure it’s an inside job. Sex and Skin: None besides some teens kissing. There might be more as we go along. Parting Shot: The jumpsuited shooters stop in a field and burn their backpacks and unicorn masks. Sleeper Star: Will Assy Levy’s character, Ruso, be able to support Davidi’s theories while keeping his more impulsive instincts in check? Sounds like she’ll be an important part of the ensemble. Most Pilot-y Line: Davidi tells the vice principal, defending a student who wants to back in to get his Tefillin, “We don’t care about his Tefillin or his dope or whatever it is, and you don’t want us to care.” Oof. Our Call: STREAM IT. The story of Black Space leaves more than enough openings for the show’s creators to go in interesting directions and provide multiple twists. Let’s hope they use that power well.

259,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Cew-GocrqHs/,"Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said Thursday on ABC’s “The View” that Democrats in Congress “want to ban assault rifles and large magazines” for guns in response to mass shootings. Co-host Sunny Hostin said, “We were just talking about the tragic shooting in San Jose that killed nine people and the gunman. 86 people have died in mass killings in the U.S. so far this year compared with 106 for all of 2020. Is there any hope that you can see on the horizon for breaking this cycle and Congress perhaps acting together in a bipartisan fashion?” Gillibrand said, “I think there is hope. One of the bills that I lead is ending gun trafficking because a lot of the senseless gun violence we see in New York State, whether it’s in the Bronx or in Brooklyn, is because of gun violence with guns that have been trafficked into the state and sold directly to gang members. That vote last time got 58 bipartisan votes, so we’re very close to 60.” She continued, “We want to have universal background checks, I think that’s something that can get to 60, and we want to ban assault rifles and large magazines. Every time there is a mass shooting, it breaks your heart. It’s shocking that Congress did nothing after Sandy Hook. So perhaps in this era of bipartisanship that we can come together and actually get something done on it. I’m hopeful, and I think we should keep trying because the nation is looking to us to get something done.” Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN 2nd AmendmentClipsPoliticsDemocratsgun controlKirsten GillibrandSunny Hostin .

        Clarissa-Jan Lim Last updated on May 28, 2021, at 8:34 p.m. ET Posted on May 27, 2021, at 5:46 p.m. ET After nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transit Authority (VTA) were killed in a mass shooting at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday, their coworkers and bosses mourned them in a press conference Thursday. A refrain emerged in their collective grief: “the VTA family.”“Many of those folks worked here for 20 to 30 years,” George Sandoval, a light rail maintenance operations manager who worked closely with some of the victims, said at the Thursday press conference. “When you work in a small group … there’s a bond that occurs. You really do become a family.” Many of the victims had worked different positions throughout the transit organization over several years. They left behind parents, siblings, spouses, and children, but also a tight-knit family of coworkers.“We’re a relatively small agency. … We all know each other,” Sandoval said. “It’s beyond the facility; it’s agencywide. It truly is a VTA family.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of the light rail yard, has been with VTA for 22 years and worked directly — and daily — with three of the victims. “I’m that unfortunate leader who lost my VTA family members,” an emotional Singh said at the press conference. Singh shared the same office with Paul Megia, a beloved and respected 42-year-old superintendent who had worked his way up from a bus operator trainee since he joined the agency in 2002. Paul Megia “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable,” Singh said. “Paul always accepted it with a smile. He was always willing to help his employees and they seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Even as they were under fire on Thursday morning, Megia looked out for his employees and told them to take cover, another VTA employee told Mercury News. Phil Guzman, who worked with Megia, called him “one of the best supervisors [he'd] ever worked for.” “He honestly had all of my respect,” Guzman wrote in a Facebook post. “Never too busy to listen to whatever stupid, silly or crazy thoughts I had. A truly honest and genuine person. People like this don't enter your life enough. I miss you, Paul.” Leticia Montuy, another VTA employee, also paid tribute to Megia. “His sincerity, his love, his genuine nature of actually giving a fck will be replaced by no one!” she wrote on Facebook. “I'll miss him so much.” “This man here was fair and graceful,” another coworker, Taron Davis MacCampbell, wrote in a Facebook tribute to Megia. Megia, who had two sons, a daughter, and a stepson, was scheduled to leave for Disneyland with his children on Thursday, his father, Leonard Megia, told the New York Times. Megia immigrated from the Philippines to the US as a toddler and lived with his father and his three children, whom he loved deeply, his father said. They liked to go wakeboarding in the summer and snowboarding in winter, Leonard told the Times. “He was a wonderful dad,” Leonard said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” In an emotional tribute to Megia, his childhood friend Monica Lennon, wrote, “Thank you for making my life so much brighter because of your infectious smile, that special twinkle in your eyes whenever you talked, for making me laugh fr your dorky jokes every single time we hung out, and for always making me see the brighter side of life with your humor and positivity.” VTA employees also remembered Adrian Balleza, a 29-year-old maintenance worker and light rail operator who joined the agency in 2014. He was the youngest victim of the shooting. Adrian Balleza “What can I say about this gentleman,” Singh, whom Balleza reported to, said Thursday. “A gem of a person, very kindhearted.” Singh said that Balleza used to volunteer to raise funds for his coworkers in need. Guzman, who also worked with Balleza at VTA, wrote that it was like having a younger cousin around. “‘Sup puto’ and a middle finger, is how this guy greeted me everyday,” Guzman wrote on Facebook. “It always made me smile. Sometimes it was the highlight of my day… Adrian Balleza, my friend, I will truly miss talking trash with you.” Augie Cruz, a VTA employee who knew Balleza and Megia, said he lost “two good friends” in the shooting. “Nothing but good memories with them."" Balleza, whose Facebook profile was filled with photos of his 2-year-old son, was remembered by his relatives and friends as a kindhearted man with a bright smile who loved his family dearly. He could not wait until his son was old enough so he could go fishing with him, his wife, Heather Balleza, told the New York Times. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” A friend remembered Balleza as a courageous and strong person. “Thank you for being someone to look up to,” Timothy Joshua Peralez wrote on Facebook. Another friend wrote, “The world won’t be the same without your smile.” Taptejdeep Singh, a 36-year-old light rail operator at VTA, was killed after alerting his coworkers about the shooting and trying to protect them, his family and colleagues said. Taptejdeep Singh Sukhvir Singh (no relation), another VTA employee, said he got a phone call from Taptejdeep to warn him about the shooter on Wednesday morning and to hide or get out immediately. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Sukhvir said that Taptej, as he was known to his coworkers and friends, spent the last moments of his life making sure others in the building and elsewhere would be able to stay safe. “Because of him, so many people were able to go home to their families,” Sukhvir said. Taptej’s brother, Bagga Singh, said witnesses told him that Taptej had taken one woman to the control room and told her to hide over there. He could have stayed there too, Bagga said, but instead he chose to save her and then went down the stairwell, where he was shot by the gunman. Another brother, Karman Singh, said Taptej tried to quickly get his colleagues into secure offices and was frantically calling others who were coming in for a shift change to warn them about the shooter. “We understand that he was attempting to secure his building when he was killed,” Karman said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. “Even in these moments of chaos, Taptejdeep was living by the values of Sikhi: living in service and protection of others. We believe that if the shooter had ever asked our brother for help, Taptejdeep would have gone above and beyond for him like he did for everyone he crossed paths with; he never harmed anyone, and no one who knew him would ever want to harm him. We choose to remember Taptejdeep as the hero he was, both in those final moments and throughout his life of service.” P.J. Bath, a VTA light rail operator, was not only Taptej’s coworker but also his brother-in-law. “He was always helpful to everyone and caring,” Bath told Mercury News. Naunihal, whom Taptej reported to, said he was always asking how he could help out others. He said that even when Taptej disagreed with him, he would “take it with a smile and accept it.” Aaron Morrow, who said he knew Taptej through his transit advocacy work, wrote on Facebook that he “would share with [him] how he just wanted to help his community and be a great ambassador for individuals who depend on public transit.” It was Taptej’s second day back on the job after he had returned from a vacation, his family said. He had immigrated from India to the US about 17 years ago. He and his wife were raising a 3-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter in Union City. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” Bagga Singh said. Jose Dejesus Hernandez III Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, age 35, started at the VTA in 2012 as a transit mechanic, and later became an electro mechanic and substation maintainer. In a post on Facebook, Rochelle Ruizesparza Velazquez described Hernandez as her cousin-in-law’s son. “I am so heartbroken for what our city has suffered today,” she wrote. “The loss of a family member is just too painful to accept let alone the loss of a child.” Timothy Michael Romo, 49, was a power foreman at the VTA, where he worked for more than 22 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. His neighbor Keith Baldwin told the San Francisco Chronicle that Romo and his wife had been planning a vacation to see their son before the shooting. Another neighbor said Romo was friendly and “always ready to help you out.” Like Romo, Abdolvahab Alaghmandan had also worked at the VTA for two decades. At 63, he was one of the two oldest victims of the shooting. Abdolvahab ""Abdi"" Alaghmandan Alaghmandan was known to friends and family as Abdi. Megan Staker, whose boyfriend is Alaghmandan's son Soheil, told BuzzFeed News in a statement that he immigrated to the US from Iran so that his family could have a better life, ""which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse."" The has since started a GoFund Me to cover expenses. Staker said he was generous and hardworking, and ""like a second father of my own."" “He was so funny and kind and loving and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives,” she said. Lars Kepler Lane was another 63-year-old VTA employee killed in the shooting. He built and maintained the VTA’s electrical power system as a journeyman lineman, according to his LinkedIn. Lars Kepler Lane He came from a family of seven brothers and sisters. He had three kids and was a grandfather, Fox 40 reported. He would have turned 64 three days after the shooting. In an interview with the local outlet, his brother Edward Lane described the agonizing wait for officials to identify the victims on Wednesday “Why do we have to suffer 10 hours to find out if he’s alive or he’s dead?” Edward said. “If they need someone to walk on the floor and find out if one of them is my brother, I’d be happy to.” In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Sonja Lea Gilchrist called Lars “a favorite family member” and wrote that her heart “is broken in a million pieces.” “We sat in a room for 6.5 hours getting no information and then finally the worst news ever,” she added. “I know God has a plan, but why????” A GoFundMe set up to help with Lars' funeral costs described him as a loving husband, father, grandfather, uncle, and brother who adored his family fiercely. ""To know Lars Lane is to love him,"" the fundraiser said. ""He was the first to help his neighbor, his family and anyone that knew him."" Lars was also friends with another victim, 40-year-old Michael Rudometkin, who was a passionate member of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 265, his family said in a statement. He was at the rail yard on Wednesday for a union meeting when the shooting happened. While waiting for officials to identify the victims on Wednesday, Rudometkin’s cousin told KCRA that he loved his job and “always stood up for everyone’s rights.” Michael Rudometkin The president of ATU Local 265, John Courtney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he posted on Facebook in the early hours of Thursday morning, “I lay here shaking with tears in my eyes. Please Lord help the families.” “He had just turned 40 and had more to live and accomplished. He has always been a wonderful son, brother, loving husband, uncle, cousin and friend to many,” Rudometkin's family said. “He would give his last shirt and penny off his back. Anyone could call him for help and he’d be there.” On Facebook, Rudometkin showed an affinity for motorcycles, posting photos of his rides and bikes. His family said he loved sports, working at home, and the Russian River. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council and a close friend of Rudometkin's, said they had been planning a golf outing before the shooting. “My dad and I were just planning another golf day reunion with Mikey, and now that will never happen again,” Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Rudometkin worked at the VTA since 2013 and graduated from a two-year apprenticeship program at the agency in 2018 to become an overhead lineworker, overseeing and maintaining the system’s overhead electrical wires. When Rudometkin graduated from the apprenticeship in 2018, Lars congratulated him and the other graduates on Facebook, commenting on a photo, “Great accomplishment, gentlemen!” Alex Fritch, the ninth victim in the shooting, died late on Wednesday at the hospital in the arms of his wife, Terra Fritch, KTVU reported. Alex Fritch Alex was a transit mechanic at the VTA and would have celebrated his ninth year at the organization in June. He had a 30-year-old daughter and two teenage sons, Terra told the local outlet, and the couple had been married for 20 years. On Instagram, Alex often posted about movies he was watching and photos of cocktails from bars in the Bay Area. He was also part of Sacramento Ohana, a local group that organized events at tiki bars. In a GoFundMe for Alex’s memorial, Terra describes him as “an optimistic man, passionate man, a dreamer who loved his family with all his heart.” “Alex Fritch was full of life,” the fundraiser says. “He loved his Tiki crawls, dirt bikes, Star Wars, being with his wife Terra, and loving life with his family.” Naunihal, the superintendent, remembered his three coworkers, Taptej, Megia, and Balleza, as people who had a calming effect on everyone else. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m lost for words,” Naunihal said. “At the same time, I’m trying to find the reasons why. None of our family members from VTA deserve this punishment.” Tasneem Nashrulla is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York. Contact Tasneem Nashrulla at tasneem.nashrulla@buzzfeed.com.

                    Stephanie Sy David Coles


                    David Coles A new investigation by USA Today and The Trace finds that the ATF, the federal body policing the gun industry, is ""frequently toothless and conciliatory,"" goes easy on ""wayward dealers"" and  sometimes allows guns to ""flow into the hands of criminals."" Stephanie Sy speaks to USA Today's Nick Penzenstadler, one of the lead investigative reporters, about the report and the San Jose mass shooting. Judy Woodruff: The shooting in San Jose that took nine lives is the latest in a spike of mass shootings. In fact, the U.S. is averaging more than 10 a week this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The Archive defines a mass shooting as one where four or more people are injured or killed. It's led many to ask once again about guns and what can be done. Stephanie Sy looks at the role of the federal government's chief watchdog — that is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — in a conversation she taped a short time ago. Stephanie Sy: Judy, a new investigation by USA Today and The Trace finds that the ATF, which is in charge of policing the gun industry, is — quote — ""frequently toothless and conciliatory, bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers, and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals."" A team of reporters looked at more than 2,000 gun inspections between 2015 and 2017. It found too many cases of dealers breaking the law without significant punishment, and managers who overrode recommendations to revoke gun licenses. It also found that dealers were inspected only once every seven years, on average. Nick Penzenstadler of USA Today is one of the lead investigative reporters, and joins me now. Nick, thank you so much for your time. I read the report. It's comprehensive. And every time there is another mass shooting in this country, we ask these questions: Where can this cycle be broken? Your investigation focuses on that point of sale of the gun. What did you find that the ATF is falling short on there? And what is an example you found? Nick Penzenstadler: Right. We found a two-part problem here. We found gun sellers not following the rules and not living up to their promise to do the paperwork correctly and to ask for identification and record all that information about gun buyers correctly. And then we also found the ATF, who came to inspect those gunshots, not following up on their inspections and revoking licenses or doing any meaningful punishment to correct this action. Stephanie Sy: You specifically found that field investigators are coming up with recommendations and warnings. In some cases, they are recommending that a license to sell a gun be revoked. And higher-ups are overruling that. I guess the question is, why is that happening? Nick Penzenstadler: Well, there is tremendous pressure to not shut down a gun shop, especially for the paperwork errors. But we're really focused on these willful violations, when a gun shop is given a second chance and a third chance, and they still can't seem to get it right. And many times, a field investigator, like you said, will recommend them for revocation, but then a higher-up will give them some more leniency and another chance to reform. And that is really based on this effort to get compliance vs. shutting down a business. Stephanie Sy: Are there valid reasons for why they would overrule a recommendation to revoke a license? Is it because they want to keep businesses open? Or is there something more nefarious you found? Nick Penzenstadler: We certainly saw many reasons. I mean, we saw reasons ranging from, this shop just opened, we need to give them a chance to get their feet under them, to, this shop has been open for decades, let's give them a break because this is only a few mistakes in hundreds of thousands of sales. So, we also saw that number based on volume. If a shop sold a ton of guns and they had a small number of errors, obviously, the ATF would give them more leniency. But, really, the concern ask is that the ATF is unwilling or unable to shut down shops because of the political pressure and the legal resources it takes to string those out. Stephanie Sy: Because of political pressure. And gun shop owners seem to understand that. Your report suggests that former ATF officials believe that this culture of leniency is understood by gun shop owners. So, are we just talking about owners not filling out paperwork, Nick, or are we talking about real-world consequences? Did you find a connection between criminality and the lack of oversight that you report by the ATF? Nick Penzenstadler: Yes, I mean, we found shops that were repeatedly warned that they were selling to straw buyers, people who are prohibited, and having someone else stand in for them, and then, months down the line, a gun purchased by a straw buyer is used in a violent crime. So, yes, these actions are not just paperwork issues. This is the crux of many criminal investigations, where police are looking at the records generated from these sales to identify where guns came from. So, this is a crucial link that the FBI and local police use to solve crime. Stephanie Sy: And, Nick, what is the ATF's explanation for this leniency? Nick Penzenstadler: The word from the ATF is that they really only go after the willful violators, they are only going to focus on the most serious issues, and they only have the resources to go after so many. There is also a federal law that says a gun shop can only be inspected once a year. And, obviously, they are not even hitting that, averaging about one every seven years. Stephanie Sy: President Biden's current pick for heading up the ATF is known to be a staunch proponent of gun control. Do you see him having the authority to change this culture at the ATF if he is confirmed? Nick Penzenstadler: Yes. David Chipman was on the Hill yesterday talking about this exact issue. One of his main points is that these shop owners should be alerting local authorities when someone comes in and tries to buy a gun illegally. If they are prohibited, they fill out the paperwork as committing a felony, it's likely that they could go on and commit more violent felonies. So, that was an issue that came up yesterday. And a lot of these problems could be solved with administrative action that don't require new laws, don't require this big political fight. It is really about focusing resources and changing how we view this regulatory structure from leniency and second chances and compliance to more of a crackdown. Stephanie Sy: Nick Penzenstadler, journalist with USA Today, thank you. Nick Penzenstadler: You're welcome. Judy Woodruff: And shortly after Stephanie recorded that interview, officials at the ATF wrote back with a response. It plans to hire, it says, 100 more investigators in the next year to increase compliance and enforcement. When there is willful disregard for regulations, the ATF says it will seek criminal prosecutions.

264,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/27/us/san-jose-shooting/the-gunmans-ex-wife-said-he-had-complained-about-his-co-workers-years-ago,"The gunman targeted his co-workers at a transit agency, killing nine of them, the Santa Clara County sheriff said. Border officials once found writing by the gunman about how he hated his workplace. ‘He is the hero.’ A San Jose survivor says a call from one of the victims saved his life. ‘Our hearts are forever broken’: What we know about the shooting victims. Union leader: ‘We will never know’ what motivated the gunman to target colleagues. The gunman’s ex-wife said he had complained about his co-workers years ago. At memorial vigil, signs for gun control and ‘Prayers 4 San Jose.’ The municipal transit worker who the police say shot and killed nine of his colleagues at a rail yard in San Jose was stopped by border officials in 2016, during which they searched his bags and found writings about how he hated the agency he worked for, according to an official who described a message that was circulated within the Homeland Security Department after Wednesday’s shooting. The gunman, who the authorities said killed himself and was identified as Samuel James Cassidy, 57, was stopped by Customs and Border Protection officials in August 2016 as he returned from a trip to the Philippines, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. In addition to the notebook with writings about how he hated the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, where he worked, the officials also found books about terrorism and manifestoes, the official said. The police in California said on Thursday that they were still trying to understand what led to the shooting, but that they had discovered more firepower at the scene than they had initially reported. Three semiautomatic handguns were found at the scene, as were 32 high-capacity magazines which each held a dozen nine-millimeter rounds, said Deputy Cian Jackson, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. He said at least one witness had reported that the gunman told someone at the scene that he was not going to hurt them, suggesting that he may have selected his victims. Detectives were continuing to interview witnesses on Thursday to try to understand what had happened, though a statement from the sheriff’s office said the gunman had been “a highly disgruntled V.T.A. employee for many years.” “The general vibe we get is that he didn’t like anybody and nobody really liked him,” Deputy Jackson said in an interview. He added that the police had feared that there was an explosive device in the gunman’s locker at work, but that none was discovered. He declined to comment on the report of the 2016 stop by border officials, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Homeland Security Department, which includes Customs and Border Protection, also declined to comment on the stop and did not respond to a question about whether the border agency had shared information about it at the time. The gunman had carried out the rampage early on Wednesday morning at the same time that his house was erupting in flames more than eight miles away. Sheriff Laurie Smith told reporters that based on photographs of at least two of the guns, they appeared to be legal to buy in California, though she did not say whether Mr. Cassidy had purchased them legally. Californians voted in 2016 to ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds, as the gunman’s did, but it was blocked from going into effect by a judge after a lawsuit by the National Rifle Association. A legal battle over the law is ongoing. Sheriff Smith said the gunman had been “very deliberate” in killing his colleagues at the transit agency near downtown San Jose, and that he had killed himself as deputies rushed into the rail yard from their headquarters next door. Sheriff Smith said on NBC’s “Today” show that the fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was first reported three minutes after someone had called 911 to report gunfire at the rail yard, suggesting that he may have set off “some kind of device” to start the blaze as he opened fire. She said investigators had found “explosive materials” at the suspect’s home. — Eileen Sullivan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Shawn Hubler and Thomas Fuller The phone call came at 6:36 a.m. and lasted for 44 seconds. Sukhvir Singh, a mechanic at the rail yard where nine of his colleagues were killed, says the call on Wednesday morning was the difference between life and death for him and a half dozen co-workers. On the line was a colleague, Taptejdeep Singh, with an urgent warning. “He was talking quite fast,” Sukhvir Singh said. “He said, ‘Hey! There’s an active shooter. Get out.’” Sukhvir Singh, who specializes in repairing and maintaining the light-rail trains that run through San Jose, fled with his crew members to a windowless building that houses antique rolling stock. There they waited until sheriff’s deputies arrived. The man who made the call was killed by the gunman. Sukhvir Singh said he was told that his body was discovered on a staircase. Few employees at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, the agency where the shooting took place, have told their stories of survival. Outside a union hall on Thursday, rank-and-file members said they had been told they would be fired if they spoke to reporters. Sukhvir Singh said he wanted to speak out as a tribute to Taptejdeep Singh, whom he described as an unfailingly gracious and helpful colleague. The two men are not related. “There are still people out there who want to help others more than themselves,” he said. “He is the hero for everyone.” The killing of Taptejdeep Singh, he said, also underlined the senselessness of the shooting. He said the gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, barely knew Taptejdeep Singh. They worked in different departments. Mr. Cassidy worked in Building B, which handles the maintenance of electrical substations. Taptejdeep Singh was a light-rail operator who when he was not driving trains was in Building A, where trains were serviced. “They didn’t have any connection at all,” he said. For a time Sukhvir Singh worked in the same building as Mr. Cassidy. He would pass him in the halls and say hello. At best Mr. Cassidy would acknowledge him with a grunt, he said. “He didn’t really communicate with other people,” he said. “He was in his own world.” — Thomas Fuller Nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority were killed in a shooting at the system’s rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. The victims of the shooting were identified by the Santa Clara County medical examiner’s office as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. Here is what we know about their lives. Adrian Balleza was described by his wife, Heather Balleza, as a humble and caring individual who was loved by many people. Now, she wrote over a messaging platform on Thursday morning, his family and friends are heartbroken. Mr. Balleza’s 2-year-old son will have to spend his years without a father. “It still doesn’t feel real,” she wrote. Mr. Balleza started working at the V.T.A. in 2014 as a bus operator trainee, later becoming a maintenance worker and light rail operator, the authority said. Mr. Balleza could not wait until his son was old enough for them to go fishing together, Ms. Balleza said. She was grief-stricken that her husband would not be able to watch his son grow up. And her own world is no longer whole, she said. “The world needs more people like my husband, not one less,” she said. “He was my night and day. The best father and husband … my forever angel.” Naunihal Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for V.T.A., was Mr. Balleza’s supervisor. He described Mr. Balleza as a “gem of a person” and a “very kindhearted” man who was always volunteering to help organize fun activities for co-workers. “Words are not enough to justify the pain we’re all going through,” Mr. Singh told reporters on Thursday. “I’m angry. I’m sad. I’m at a loss for words.” Ed Lane expressed anguish on Wednesday night over the death of his brother Lars Lane, who worked as a journeyman lineman for the V.T.A., according to his LinkedIn profile. “My brother was murdered today,” Mr. Lane said in an email. “Not by a gun but by a man that could have been helped.” Mr. Lane spent much of the day waiting to find out if his brother, who local media outlets reported was a husband and a father, was among the victims. He sharply criticized the way the notification process was handled, in addition to the renewed call for tougher gun control laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting. “I’m tired of the gun control propaganda,” he said. “Politicians and law enforcement patting themselves on the back leaving my family in the dark for 12 hours. The family assistance was absolutely a front of incompetence.” Jose Dejesus Hernandez III could build and fix anything, said his ex-wife, Sarah Raelyn. They were married for more than 10 years until 2020, and Mr. Hernandez was the most intelligent and sweetest man she had ever known, she said. Once he even sold all of his musical equipment to buy her a chihuahua named Lylia. Mr. Hernandez had worked at the V.T.A. since 2012, starting as a transit mechanic, and later becoming an electro-mechanic and a substation mechanic. He played guitar, built motorcycles and “loved the Lord,” Ms. Raelyn said over a messaging platform. Mr. Hernandez also acted as an older brother and a mentor to Ms. Raelyn’s brother. “My heart will never fully heal from this tragedy,” she said. “This world lost an amazing man yesterday, but heaven gained one.” Paul Delacruz Megia immigrated to the United States from the Philippines when he was a toddler, according to his father, Leonard Megia. He had two sons, a daughter and a stepson, and he loved them deeply, his father said. They liked to take a boat out and go wakeboarding during the summer, his father said, and in the winter, snowboarding was their favorite activity. Mr. Megia had planned a trip to Disneyland with his children. They were scheduled to leave on Thursday. “He was a wonderful dad,” his father said. “He’s my son and my best friend.” Mr. Megia and his father lived in the same home together near Tracy, Calif., along with his three children. The father and son were very close — they enjoyed fishing and spending time in the snow together during the winter. Mr. Megia was always smiling, his father said, and constantly had a positive demeanor. The V.T.A. said Mr. Megia had been employed there for 20 years, working his way up from bus operator trainee to superintendent-service management. Mr. Megia left home every morning at 4:30 a.m. to get to work on time, but made sure to call his children every single morning to check in on them before they started school. “He’s a very loving dad who cared a lot about his children,” his father said. “They’re going to miss him.” Mr. Singh, the superintendent of light rail transportation for the V.T.A., shared an office with Mr. Megia. He described Mr. Megia as an easygoing manager who was popular with employees. “Sometimes my demands could be unreasonable, but Paul always accepted it with a smile. He always was willing to help his employees,” Mr. Singh said. “They seemed to reach out to him for whatever their needs were.” Taptejdeep Singh, a light rail operator for the V.T.A., was remembered by a cousin as the nicest person in his family and a gregarious man who enjoyed playing volleyball. “We are very sad right now,” said the cousin, Bagga Singh, who was one of more than a dozen family members waiting all Wednesday to learn what had happened to their relative. Shortly after 6 p.m., they got the bad news. Several family members broke down sobbing at a Red Cross facility and were escorted away. The death of Mr. Singh, who was Sikh and moved to the United States from India in 2005, marks the second time in two months that members of the country’s Sikh community mourned after a mass shooting. In April, four Sikhs were among the eight people killed in a shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis. Taptejdeep Singh had a wife and two young children, Bagga Singh said, and enjoyed his job at the V.T.A., where he had been working for eight or nine years. He also had an insurance license and was a real estate agent, Bagga Singh said. “He can work anything he wants, very smart guy,” he said. Family members said county officials told them that Taptejdeep Singh acted heroically when he detected danger during the attack, calling out to his co-workers that shots were being fired and quickly ushering one woman into a secure room. “I think he’s the one who tried to save the people, as many as he could,” said Bagga Singh, who also spoke out against gun violence: “Nobody should have a gun.” Michael Joseph Rudometkin began working for the V.T.A. in 2013 as a transit mechanic, according to the agency. He then became an electro-mechanic and an overhead line worker. Raul Peralez, a member of the San Jose City Council, called Mr. Rudometkin a “lifelong friend.” He said that he and his father had been planning a golf outing with Mr. Rudometkin. “Now that will never happen again,” Mr. Peralez said on Facebook. “My family and I have lost a long time great friend and there are no words to describe the heartache we are feeling right now, especially for his family.” Mr. Rudometkin was married and is survived by his parents and his sister, said Mr. Peralez, who told reporters on Thursday that he had met with Mr. Rudometkin’s wife, parents, sister and brother-in-law. “I truly feel for all the victims’ families,” he said. “Personally, my heart is broken.” Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, an immigrant from Iran, was a substation maintainer who worked at the transit agency for about two decades. A family friend called him “like a second father of my own.” “He moved his family to the United States so that they could have a better life, which makes this horrific tragedy just all the worse,” said Megan Staker, whose boyfriend, Soheil, is Mr. Alaghmandan’s son. “He worked so hard so that his family could have a good life,” she said. “He was so funny, and kind and loving, and could fix anything. Things will never be the same without him. He brought so much joy and laughter to our lives. To say he will be missed is an understatement. Our hearts are forever broken.” Mr. Fritch started at the transit agency in 2012 as a mechanic and had worked most recently as a substation maintainer. He was the only one of the nine victims who died with his family by his side, at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center. “He was our rock, my safe place to fall,” his wife, Tessa Fritch, told KTVU-TV. “He was the love of my life.” The couple had been married for 20 years, Ms. Fritch said, and they planned to renew their vows in Hawaii in September. They had two teenage boys and a 30-year-old daughter. Ms. Fritch told the station that their daughter came from San Diego to see him, as did his parents and friends. “We got to say goodbyes,” she said. Timothy Romo began working for the transit agency over 20 years ago, and was last employed as an overhead line worker. A native of Greenfield, Calif., Mr. Romo was the son of Mike Romo, a former police chief and mayor of Greenfield. He is survived by two sisters, two brothers and his parents, as well as his wife, children and grandchildren, the city’s current mayor, Lance Walker, said on Facebook. Mr. Romo “touched the lives of anyone that knew him through his big smile and endless jokes,” according to a memorial fund set up for his family. “He will forever live in our hearts and be remembered as the funny, caring, selfless man that he was.” A neighbor of Mr. Romo told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had been planning a vacation with his wife, hoping to visit their son, in the days before the shooting. “He was a very friendly man, always ready to help you out,” said one neighbor, Nancy Martin. — Kellen Browning, Neil Vigdor, Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Maria Cramer, Adeel Hassan and Will Wright A leader in a labor group that represents the workers killed at the rail yard in San Jose this week expressed frustration and bewilderment about the gunman’s motives on Thursday. “No issues that we know of that were red flags — but what is a red flag?” said Arturo Aguilar, chairman of the California Conference Board of the Amalgamated Transit Union, in an interview on the lawn outside the union’s San Jose office. “We are not trained to analyze co-workers.” Mr. Aguilar said the union did not see patterns in which of his colleagues that Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, chose to shoot. The nine victims who were killed on Wednesday came from various departments, he said. “We don’t know the relationships or the correlations between the victims and the shooter,” Mr. Aguilar said. “And we will never know.” The union’s main task right now, Mr. Aguilar said, was consoling members, many of whom gathered at the union’s office on Thursday. — Thomas Fuller The ex-wife of the man who fatally shot nine people at a San Jose rail yard this week said he grew angrier during their 10-year marriage and had complained about his co-workers, saying, “I wish I could kill them.” The gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, and his ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, 64, divorced in the mid-2000s, she said in an interview, and had not spoken in 13 years. Ms. Nelms said that Mr. Cassidy, who proposed three months after they met in a nightclub in Cupertino, was initially the perfect husband. She said he loved pets — including several boa constrictors — and swam at a nearby gym. “He was a good guy, very affectionate, thoughtful, polite,” she recalled. But over the years, Ms. Nelms said, Mr. Cassidy’s personality changed. He grew meaner, angrier and more impatient, hating when her family members dropped by their home unannounced. “It was escalating, little by little,” she said. “Every time we had an argument, he would start yelling and screaming, hitting the walls, banging the table, slamming the door. Very intimidating.” Eventually, the arguing became too much, and the couple divorced. Ms. Nelms said Mr. Cassidy took medication for depression and had complained about his co-workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, grumbling that some were lazy or had easier jobs than he did. Occasionally, she said, Mr. Cassidy would say, “I wish I could kill them.” But she did not think he was serious at the time, and said she was shocked when she heard that Mr. Cassidy had killed several of his colleagues. “That was the last thing I would think he would do,” Ms. Nelms said. “I was just shaking.” One thing in particular made no sense to her. Mr. Cassidy, she said, had never expressed any interest in guns. — Kellen Browning transcript “Today, we’re here together as one community. We’re here because members of our community, our colleagues, our family members, our friends, our loved ones are suffering, and each of us feels our own pain as well.” “Paul was a wonderful husband and father, who was full of love. All of you who know him knows he’s full of jokes. He has energy for life, and always up for new adventures. I will treasure all our memories. He was a great friend, son, mentor to all. He was so proud of being an employee at V.T.A., and all the accomplishments he made here.” “Whatever you need to do to get some support. I know I need it myself, but these aren’t names to us. These are people we know and we love. And we’ve seen every single day of our working lives. And it really, really hurts down to the very core of our souls. So please, A.T.U., let’s do what we do and stand with each other for each other by each other.” “I only have a few words to say. Never leave home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye. Because that one was the last I got.” SAN JOSE, Calif. — Hundreds of people gathered in a plaza outside the San Jose City Hall rotunda on Thursday evening to memorialize the nine transit authority employees who were killed by a co-worker at a rail yard the day before. Some arrived holding signs calling for gun control or offering “prayers 4 San Jose.” Others wore union pins, shirts and masks. A few held flowers. Family members crumpled to the ground in front of a memorial for the victims, an arrangement of bouquets, wreaths, American flags, photos and hats for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. Mayor Sam Liccardo and other officials spoke, but most in the crowd were too far away to hear what was said. When the microphones failed, many people pulled out their phones and listened to a stream of the speeches on Facebook. Some cried silently. “Tonight, we’re united in our commitment to our diverse community, where we prioritize togetherness over division, hope over fear, progress over violence,” said Representative Zoe Lofgren, one of the speakers. “We don’t have to be the only country on earth where mass shootings are a near-daily occurrence.” A memorial for the nine VTA employees. pic.twitter.com/lNamd7s2VV In front of flags flying at half-staff, transit workers gathered. Some knew the victims and were at the rail yard at the time of the shooting. Most declined to speak about the attack. Walter Hale, a V.T.A. employee, said that when he heard the news Wednesday, “I was done, I was destroyed.” But on Thursday, he said, “I knew I needed to be here with my brothers and sisters.” — Kellen Browning Investigators do not yet know whether the victims of Wednesday’s shooting at a rail yard in San Jose were specifically targeted, and they have not identified a motive for the gunman, Laurie Smith, the sheriff of Santa Clara County, said in an interview Thursday morning on NBC’s “Today.” “What in the world could possibly prompt someone to take this kind of action?” she said. “We don’t know at this point.” Officers confronted Samuel James Cassidy, whom California law enforcement officials identified as the gunman, “within a few minutes,” Sheriff Smith said, suggesting the carnage could have been worse if they had not arrived quickly. The sheriff’s office headquarters is next door to the rail yard. Mr. Cassidy carried two semiautomatic handguns and had 11 loaded magazines, she said, adding that police dogs at the scene found materials for bombs in what investigators believe to be his locker. Investigators are also looking into how a fire at Mr. Cassidy’s house was apparently started while he was carrying out the attack. The police received the first report of shots fired at 6:34 a.m., and the call reporting the fire came in at 6:37 a.m. “What we’re operating under now, but I’m not sure that this isn’t going to change, is that he set some kind of a device to go off at a certain time, probably to coincide with the shooting,” she said. The nine victims of the shooting were spread over two buildings, she said. “He was very deliberate, very fast,” she said. “He knew where employees would be.” — Daniel Victor Everything was set for an ordinary day in a suburban corner of southeastern San Jose on Wednesday. Doug Suh had an early golf game scheduled. Andy and Alice Abad were preparing for a morning doctor’s appointment. And Anthony Nguyen was, as always, set for his daily 9:30 a.m. church service. But by early afternoon, each resident of the neighborhood discovered in their own way that something had gone very wrong. Early on Wednesday, Abad watched from his kitchen as a funnel of smoke and flames poured from a home one block away. Suh got a call from a friend on the golf course about a man who had killed eight workers at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard. (It would later become nine.) And Nguyen got a similar call from a friend but with a more disturbing detail: “The man who did it was your neighbor,” Nguyen’s friend told him. By noon, their neighborhood was swarming with multiple fire and police vehicles, federal agents and a boxy blue truck from the San Jose bomb squad. Men with gas masks and oxygen tanks stood amid the flashing lights in the cul-de-sacs of what they all described as a quiet suburban neighborhood that is home largely to Vietnamese and Filipino immigrants. Investigators on Thursday morning were still piecing together the havoc unleashed the day before. The suspect in the shooting, Samuel James Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker who had been with the V.T.A. for at least a decade, lived in a one-story home with white trim and a patchy lawn. (Mr. Cassidy lived near the Evergreen neighborhood, not in it, as an earlier post said.) Officials said Wednesday that they believed Cassidy was responsible for both setting his home on fire and then proceeding to shoot his colleagues at his workplace, the railway yard eight miles from where he lived. Suh, who lives across the street from the suspect, scanned through his security camera footage when he returned home from his golf game. The camera captured Cassidy at 5:40 a.m. loading his white pickup truck with a black bag. He was wearing a uniform with reflective stripes. Nguyen, a retired real estate broker who has lived in San Jose for the past four decades, said he was baffled by what had happened. “Everything has been very perfect,” he said of his neighborhood. “People are nice and quiet here.” When he saw flashing lights on the corner of his street on Wednesday, he assumed there had been a traffic accident. Then his friend called with the news about the shooting. “What about all these families that lost sons and fathers?” Mr. Nguyen asked in his driveway. “I’m so sorry for them. It’s not right. All these broken hearts.” — Thomas Fuller California has some of the most progressive gun laws in the country and is one of two states to receive a full A rating from the Giffords Law Center, which advocates for gun reform. The state requires universal background checks for gun owners and restrictions on the size of magazines, along with other laws that restrict the types of firearms that a person can legally purchase. But after a mass shooting on Wednesday that claimed nine lives at a San Jose rail yard, politicians including Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Biden urged lawmakers to take further action in legislating firearms. In a statement, Mr. Biden urged Congress to “heed the call of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners, to help end this epidemic of gun violence.” It is unclear what type of weapons were used by the gunman, whose body was found at the scene, where he had acquired them, or whether they would have met California’s legal standards. The state bans the possession of assault weapons, with some exceptions, and bans so-called ghost guns, which are typically assembled by an individual and do not contain a serial number. According to the Giffords Law Center, which also gives an A rating to New Jersey, California has the seventh-lowest rate of gun deaths in the country, and has the most robust system for taking guns from people who are barred from having them. At least one of California’s gun laws is being challenged in court. In August 2020, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down a state law that banned the possession of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds. In February, however, the court said it would reconsider that decision. — Will Wright The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted at least 232 mass shootings as of May 26. (The archive, a nonprofit organization, has counted 15 mass murders, which it defines as four or more people killed, in 2021.) There is little consensus on the definition of a mass shooting, complicating the efforts of nonprofits and news organizations to document the scope of the problem. The Violence Project follows the narrow definition of the Congressional Research Service, requiring the attacks to be in public and excluding domestic shootings and those “attributable to underlying criminal activity.” CNN has defined a mass shooting as one with four or more injuries or deaths. The Washington Post’s effort to track public mass shootings includes shootings with four or more people killed, but does not include robberies or domestic shootings in private homes. This year they have included shootings in Atlanta. Indianapolis. Boulder, Colo. Boone, N.C. And now San Jose. To some, it might have seemed as if mass shootings all but halted during the coronavirus pandemic, with a year passing between large-scale shootings in public places. But the shootings never stopped.

265,https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/05/27/after-san-jose-mass-shooting-california-governor-renews-call-for-gun-control,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom made an impassioned plea for national action on gun control after a shooter killed nine people in a San Jose light rail yard this week—the deadliest mass shooting in the state this year. The Democrat, who leads a state with some of the strictest gun laws in the country, was exasperated when speaking with reporters after the shooting at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority facility. Newsom called on public officials to move beyond platitudes and take responsibility for the epidemic of gun violence in the nation. “What the hell’s going on in the United States?” Newsom said. “What the hell’s wrong with us? And when are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively?” Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have loosened gun regulations in several states. This was the latest in a string of mass shootings this year, which have prompted gun safety advocates and some lawmakers nationwide to renew calls to further restrict gun ownership. Mass shootings are on the rise across the country from last year, as states begin easing pandemic restrictions and more people return to public life. But many Republican lawmakers argue restrictions are not the answer and are pushing laws that would ease gun permit and age requirements in the name of self-defense. There is a “sameness and a numbness” to these mass shootings, Newsom said. “We should all be angry at how commonplace gun violence has become in this country,” said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, in a statement. “This is an urgent crisis that requires immediate action.” A month after a shooter killed 10 people at a Boulder, Colorado, grocery store in March, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed into law a measure that requires gun owners to safely store their weapons, especially away from minors. Oregon lawmakers are debating a similar measure. States are still debating gun measures in the waning weeks of legislative sessions. Measures are also advancing in some states that would strengthen laws related to gun ownership for convicted domestic abusers and red flag laws related to court orders that seize firearms from people who may be a harm to themselves (or others).

At the same time, Republican-held states are actively loosening restrictions. In Kansas, Republican lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of a measure that lowers the age a resident can carry a concealed gun to 18. Louisiana and Texas lawmakers are advancing bills that would ease restrictions on carrying weapons without a permit. Bills that would allow guns on school property are also advancing in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. The San Jose shooting comes two years after a gunman killed three people and injured 17 more at the Gilroy Garlic Festival, also in Santa Clara County. The motive of this week’s shooter is still unclear, but authorities know he was an employee at the rail yard. The shooter took his own life. “This is why elections matter.” Daily update — original reporting on state policy, plus the day's five top reads from around the web.

News By Samuel Chamberlain Submit May 27, 2021 | 7:03pm				| Updated May 28, 2021 | 9:13am San Jose mass shooter Samuel Cassidy carried “a black memo book filled with lots of notes” about hating his place of work — and was questioned by federal agents years before the slaughter, according to a new report. Cassidy was detained by Custom and Border Protection in August 2016 upon returning from a trip to the Philippines and was found with “books about terrorism and fear and manifestos,” along with his little black book, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. But when questioned, he denied he had any “problems with anybody at work,” according to a Department of Homeland Security memo reviewed by the outlet. The DHS memo did not detail how long Cassidy was detained by agents, nor does it explain why he was stopped. The Journal said the memo does note that Cassidy had a “minor criminal history” and cited a 1983 incident in which he was arrested in San Jose and charged with “misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer.” Cassidy killed nine of his co-workers before turning the gun on himself Wednesday at a light rail facility owned by the Valley Transportation Authority, where he maintained substations. He had been employed there since at least 2012, according to public records. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith indicated in an interview with The Associated Press Thursday that the gunman targeted some of his victims while sparing others. “It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there, ‘I’m not going to shoot you,'” Smith said. “And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot.” Kirk Bertolet, a light rail signal maintainer, echoed that assessment in an interview with KGO, saying, “I do know that he had a specific agenda and was targeting certain people, he walked by people, let other people live as he gunned down other people.” Cassidy’s ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told AP he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. The couple divorced in 2005. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” Nelms said Wednesday. In 2009, a former girlfriend accused Cassidy of sexually assaulting and raping her, according to court documents obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. The woman described Cassidy as volatile and violent, with major mood swings because of bipolar disorder that became worse when he drank heavily. Several times while he was drunk, the woman claimed, Cassidy forced himself on her sexually despite her refusals, pinning her arms with his body weight. The documents were reportedly filed in response to a request for a restraining order by Cassidy, and it is not clear how the matter was disposed of. Cassidy’s most recent encounter with the law appears to have been in 2019, when he received a parking ticket. A DHS spokesperson declined to comment to the Post on the report, citing the ongoing investigation. The spokesperson added that in February, the department began a review “which included efforts to ensure law enforcement personnel have the tools and training to identify behavioral indicators associated with targeted violence and policy to improve information sharing with our partners.” With Post wires Read Next NYC EMT says he was attacked for being Jewish while in Las...

Jesse Leal Rodriguez, 34, remained in custody in Riverside on Thursday afternoon, May 27, after being arrested Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and negligent discharge of a firearm. He is being held in lieu of $750,000 bail. Although the jail log lists a Friday arraignment for Rodriguez, no charges had been filed. The California Highway Patrol’s Investigative Services Unit was reviewing crime reports and interviewing victims in an attempt to determine whether Rodriguez was responsible for any other of some 100 shooting incidents on freeways in Riverside, Orange and Los Angeles counties in the past two months, Officer Jake Sanchez, a CHP spokesman, said Thursday. “We’re talking days, weeks or months before that information starts trickling out,” Sanchez said. After weeks of near-daily reports of BB or pellet gun ammunition shattering windows and nerves on local freeways, Sanchez said he was unaware of any new incidents since Rodriguez was arrested at 9:46 p.m. Tuesday on Magnolia Avenue near Tyler Street in Riverside. Victims that night reported a description of a vehicle from which they believed the shots came — a red SUV lacking license plates — and Riverside police and the CHP stopped Rodriguez’s Chevrolet. Sanchez said he didn’t know what evidence officers recovered but added: “We don’t arrest anybody just based on a description. There has to be probable cause.” Firearm charges are not new to Rodriguez. In November 2010, Rodriguez pleaded guilty in Orange County Superior Court to felony counts of participating in criminal street gang activity and illegally carrying a loaded firearm, court records show. He was sentenced to 16 months in state prison, 270 days in jail and three years probation, though court records indicate that at least some of the sentence was stayed by a judge. A little more than two years later, Rodriguez faced more gun and gang-related charges. In December 2012, Rodriguez pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon and admitted a street gang enhancement. A charge of street terrorism was dismissed, court records show. Rodriguez was sentenced in April 2013 to 32 months in state prison. The Riverside County District Attorney’s Office was waiting for the CHP’s report before considering whether to file charges, John Hall, a DA’s Office spokesman, said Thursday. Efforts to reach Rodriguez’s family members for comment were unsuccessful Thursday. A person who answered the door at an address outside the Anaheim city limits attributed to Rodriguez by public records said he didn’t live there. Authorities have not announced any connection between the BB gun shootings and the May 21 killing of 6-year-old Aiden Leos on the 55 Freeway in Orange, which police have called a road-rage incident.

271,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/27/san-jose-mass-shooting-killer-evaded-californias-tough-gun-laws/,"Trending: The smoke had barely cleared after Wednesday’s deadly rampage by a disgruntled maintenance worker at a San Jose light rail yard when it became the focus of the nation’s fevered debate over gun laws. The Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting prompted President Joe Biden to urge Congress to “help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the scene and recalled another mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in 2019. Advocates for stricter gun laws argued that this latest in a series of mass shootings nationally is proof of the need for more federal laws. But the massacre of nine workers at Valley Transportation Authority’s maintenance yard also unfolded in a state that has enacted the most extensive restrictions on firearm ownership in the country, prompting gun-rights advocates to declare them not only ineffective but counterproductive. “California’s ‘no gun’ policies were completely ignored by the killer,” said Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America. “Did that stop the mass murderer? No. Did it leave law-abiding citizens defenseless? Yes.” While the investigation continues to unfold, new details Thursday made clear several of the state’s gun laws failed to stop the bloodshed. Law enforcement authorities said that the gunman, Samuel Cassidy, used three semi-automatic pistols, all legally obtained, but he was equipped with 32 ammunition magazines holding 12 to 15 rounds, which are illegal in California. The state limits magazines for civilian use to 10 rounds. It was not clear how or where he got them or if he bought them before California banned their sale in 2013 or possession in 2016. There was a short window after a successful court challenge last August when the larger magazines were legal to purchase, but the ban is now back in effect, pending a federal appeals court decision. Cassidy, who killed himself when deputies arrived at the scene, also had several other firearms legally registered to him, including shotguns and rifles, but only used the pistols in the rampage, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Fair. California requires universal background checks on all firearm transfers, including gun shows and private sales, background checks to buy ammunition, a 10-day waiting period after purchase, and bans military-style “assault weapons” often used in mass shootings. The high-capacity magazine ban aims to reduce the lethality of mass shootings by limiting the number of shots that can be fired before reloading, giving potential victims a chance to flee or fight back. But authorities said the gunman Wednesday used all three guns to fire off dozens of rounds, freely reloading as he mowed down his coworkers. Sheriff Laurie Smith noted that reloading a semi-automatic handgun is “very quick.” Photo shared by the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office that displays what was taken from inside the home of the San Jose VTA gunman Samuel Cassidy in San Jose. (Santa Clara County Sheriff) California also has a recently enhanced “red flag” law that allows worried family members, coworkers, employers and law enforcement officers to petition a judge to temporarily disarm a gun owner found to be acting menacingly. There appeared to be plenty of red flags around Cassidy. His ex-wife said he was volatile and talked of killing his coworkers. An ex-girlfriend accused him in a 2009 court filing of “enraged” liquor-fueled mood swings, and a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal indicated U.S. customs officials had found him with “a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA.” And in a news release Thursday afternoon, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said Cassidy “has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” But Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said it did not appear anyone had tried to invoke the red-flag law to disarm Cassidy. Johnston added that the gunman also violated laws against possessing guns in transit facilities. But advocates for expanding strict gun laws like those in California nationwide argue that just because they don’t stop all gun murders doesn’t mean they don’t work. They argue that federal laws would be even more effective, pointing to statistics showing states such as California and others with similar gun restrictions have lower firearm mortality rates than those with looser laws. “No one gun law can stop all shootings, but California’s network of strong gun laws has helped make it one of the safest states in the country,” said Jessica Blitchok, a volunteer with the California chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “Even a state with strong gun laws like California, however, is only as safe as neighboring states with weak gun laws. That’s why we need bipartisan, federal action on gun safety.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2021-05-27 20:24:07,San Jose mass shooting: Killer evaded California’s tough gun laws,,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/
272,https://spectator.org/san-jose-shooting/,"   Ten are confirmed dead after a gunman opened fire at a San Jose rail yard on Wednesday. The gunman, a longtime employee of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), attacked and killed nine of his colleagues, with an unknown number wounded, before taking his own life. The first reports of a shooting came in around 6:30 a.m., according to Sheriff’s Deputy Russell Davis. According to the New York Times, the shooting began during the VTA’s Wednesday morning shift, as “panic erupted as word spread of gunfire in two buildings.” Within minutes, law enforcement were at the VTA, with Santa Clara Sheriff Laurie Smith praising the efforts of officers responding to the rampage: “They took their life [sic] in their hands.” Firefighters responded at the same time yesterday morning to reports of a suspected arson at the shooter’s empty home in San Jose, determined later to have been started before the shooting. Local authorities, including Smith, confirmed that the shooter took his own life after realizing that law enforcement officers were inside the building. The shooter was armed with two semi-automatic handguns and 11 magazines, all legally obtained; police reportedly never engaged the gunman. Witness Kirk Bertolet described the shooter as having “a specific agenda … targeting certain people, he walked by people, let other people live as he gunned down others.” The shooter’s former girlfriend told ABC7 News that he was “not mentally stable” and that “I was lucky he didn’t kill me” in connection with “issues” between the two. Officials say the shooter’s motive is still under investigation. Among the dead are Taptejdeep Singh, a VTA light rail operator credited with heroically helping his coworkers escape to safety before being gunned down in a stairwell. Also confirmed dead was Lars Lane, a husband and grandfather. The Wednesday shooting is one of the deadliest in the Bay Area’s history and the fifth mass shooting in the region in 10 years. In addition to the shooting, explosive detection canines alerted law enforcement to the presence of elements of explosive devices on VTA’s property. The intended purpose of these is unknown. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said, “There’s numbness I imagine some of us are feeling about this because there’s a sameness to this.… It just feels like this happens over and over and over again.” Visibly frustrated and emotional, the governor lamented the tragedy: “What the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Newsom continued, hinting at potential upcoming political initiatives for his state: “[W]hen are we going to put down our arms, literally and figuratively?” He added that it’s time to deal with gun violence “and take a little damn responsibility to do a little better this time. We are resolved to not make this meaningless.” In a tweet Wednesday, President Biden expressed sympathy for victims, saying, “There are at least eight families who will never be whole again. Every life taken by a bullet pierces the soul of our nation.” The victims will be honored in a vigil at the San Jose City Hall at 6 p.m. Pacific Time Thursday.

273,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/27/san-jose-mass-shooting-killer-evaded-californias-tough-gun-laws/,"Trending: The smoke had barely cleared after Wednesday’s deadly rampage by a disgruntled maintenance worker at a San Jose light rail yard when it became the focus of the nation’s fevered debate over gun laws. The Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting prompted President Joe Biden to urge Congress to “help end this epidemic of gun violence in America.” Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the scene and recalled another mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in 2019. Advocates for stricter gun laws argued that this latest in a series of mass shootings nationally is proof of the need for more federal laws. But the massacre of nine workers at Valley Transportation Authority’s maintenance yard also unfolded in a state that has enacted the most extensive restrictions on firearm ownership in the country, prompting gun-rights advocates to declare them not only ineffective but counterproductive. “California’s ‘no gun’ policies were completely ignored by the killer,” said Aidan Johnston, director of federal affairs for Gun Owners of America. “Did that stop the mass murderer? No. Did it leave law-abiding citizens defenseless? Yes.” While the investigation continues to unfold, new details Thursday made clear several of the state’s gun laws failed to stop the bloodshed. Law enforcement authorities said that the gunman, Samuel Cassidy, used three semi-automatic pistols, all legally obtained, but he was equipped with 32 ammunition magazines holding 12 to 15 rounds, which are illegal in California. The state limits magazines for civilian use to 10 rounds. It was not clear how or where he got them or if he bought them before California banned their sale in 2013 or possession in 2016. There was a short window after a successful court challenge last August when the larger magazines were legal to purchase, but the ban is now back in effect, pending a federal appeals court decision. Cassidy, who killed himself when deputies arrived at the scene, also had several other firearms legally registered to him, including shotguns and rifles, but only used the pistols in the rampage, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Fair. California requires universal background checks on all firearm transfers, including gun shows and private sales, background checks to buy ammunition, a 10-day waiting period after purchase, and bans military-style “assault weapons” often used in mass shootings. The high-capacity magazine ban aims to reduce the lethality of mass shootings by limiting the number of shots that can be fired before reloading, giving potential victims a chance to flee or fight back. But authorities said the gunman Wednesday used all three guns to fire off dozens of rounds, freely reloading as he mowed down his coworkers. Sheriff Laurie Smith noted that reloading a semi-automatic handgun is “very quick.” Photo shared by the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office that displays what was taken from inside the home of the San Jose VTA gunman Samuel Cassidy in San Jose.

California also has a recently enhanced “red flag” law that allows worried family members, coworkers, employers and law enforcement officers to petition a judge to temporarily disarm a gun owner found to be acting menacingly. There appeared to be plenty of red flags around Cassidy. His ex-wife said he was volatile and talked of killing his coworkers. An ex-girlfriend accused him in a 2009 court filing of “enraged” liquor-fueled mood swings, and a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal indicated U.S. customs officials had found him with “a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA.” And in a news release Thursday afternoon, the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office said Cassidy “has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees.” But Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said it did not appear anyone had tried to invoke the red-flag law to disarm Cassidy. Johnston added that the gunman also violated laws against possessing guns in transit facilities. But advocates for expanding strict gun laws like those in California nationwide argue that just because they don’t stop all gun murders doesn’t mean they don’t work. They argue that federal laws would be even more effective, pointing to statistics showing states such as California and others with similar gun restrictions have lower firearm mortality rates than those with looser laws. “No one gun law can stop all shootings, but California’s network of strong gun laws has helped make it one of the safest states in the country,” said Jessica Blitchok, a volunteer with the California chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. “Even a state with strong gun laws like California, however, is only as safe as neighboring states with weak gun laws. That’s why we need bipartisan, federal action on gun safety.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2021-05-27 20:24:07,San Jose mass shooting: Killer evaded California’s tough gun laws,,35,http://www.mercurynews.com/
274,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/27/remembering-michael-rudometkin-a-vta-technician-killed-in-san-jose-mass-shooting/,"Trending: The family of Michael Rudometkin, who died at age 40 in Wednesday’s mass shooting at a Valley Transportation Authority rail yard in San Jose, said they were left devastated by the loss and are struggling to comprehend the violence that took his life. “Michael is the first person I gave my heart to and to have it broken this way is utterly cruel,” his wife, Gloria, who spent 19 years with him, said in a statement. “I will never understand why such a wonderful and gentle person had to be taken from us in this way. I am heartbroken that I will never hear another one of his bad jokes, receive one of his great bear hugs, celebrate another joint birthday together or be able to give him a hard time about his terrible driving. It was not supposed to end this way.” Rudometkin, a technician, was one of nine VTA workers shot to death by their colleague Samuel Cassidy on Wednesday at an agency rail yard in San Jose. Cassidy took his own life as police responded. Rudometkin’s parents, Gary and Rose Rudometkin, said their hearts were heavy after the “ruthless, senseless massacre.” Their son was passionate about his work and his Amalgamated Transit Union local, his parents said. “He had so much life to live, and dreams and goals to accomplish,” the couple said in a statement Friday. “He has always been a wonderful loving and caring son, brother to Janelle, loving husband to Gloria, uncle, cousin and friend to so many. Anyone could call him for help and he’d be there at any hour.” Rudometkin, who lived in Santa Cruz with Gloria, was a youth minister and pastoral council member at his church in San Jose, his parents said. “He enjoyed spending time with his wife, working on home projects, and with his fur baby dogs, Sasha and Olive,” his parents said. “Family was very important to him, and he was always a part of all of our celebrations and family functions.” His sister Janelle Aguirre and brother-in-law Alfredo Aguirre described him as “a true gentleman with a shining smile” and said, “We are unable to process how we’re feeling and what is happening.” Others close to Rudometkin recalled that he was happy to share his time and abundant technical skills with family, friends and neighbors. “He was always ready to help. He was always very handy,” said San Jose City Councilmember Raul Peralez, a VTA board member whose council District 3 contains the shooting site. Peralez had known Rudometkin, who usually went by Mike, since they became friends in 7th Grade. Rudometkin’s Santa Cruz neighbor Donna Giubbini collapsed onto her doorstep when she learned Thursday he was among the nine VTA workers shot to death by their co-worker. “This was a good, good man,” Giubbini, 60, said through tears. They had lived in homes with adjoining backyards for 10 years, she said. “He just cared about people. He went out of his way to be kind, and just the best neighbor you could ever have. I loved him. I can’t believe it. What a crappy world.” Rudometkin bought his house from Giubbini’s brother-in-law, and spruced up the place, Giubbini said. “He just fixed his yard up so beautifully. He put up lights. Meticulous. Whatever he touched, he made it nice. I just admired him so much,” she said. “He was a bright spot in my life.” Rudometkin would help her and their neighbors any way he could, trimming trees and in one case helping deal with a flood, Giubbini said. Rudometkin would ride a motorcycle to work, and on Thursday five motorcycles were parked in his driveway, along with a red convertible sports car, and a black pickup truck sitting out front. “He was always in his garage tinkering,” Giubbini said. When his wife wanted to paint their front door pink, Rudometkin had reservations but went along with it, Giubbini said. “It looks nice.” Peralez said he and Rudometkin became tighter over the years. On the Cupertino High School football team, they played the same positions — both were receivers and defensive ends — and had their lockers next to each other. “He’s close with my family, my parents, my sister,” Peralez said Thursday. “Our combined families are really close.” Peralez said he spent Wednesday night with Rudometkin’s wife, Gloria, and other close friends of Rudometkin’s, and on Thursday visited Rudemetkin’s parents. All were experiencing a mix of emotions similar to what he’s been feeling over the sudden loss of his friend, he said. “A big sense of disbelief, obviously a lot of heartbreak. It’s devastating. We all know at some point we’re going to go,” he said, “but to happen in this manner, nobody expects this and it’s so traumatic and violent it’s hard to comprehend.” Peralez recalled how Rudometkin’s nature made him immune to the social divisions in high school. “He was a friend to everybody. We were trying to think of who it was that Mike didn’t get along with, and there was nobody.” The two friends took auto-repair courses together at De Anza College in Cupertino, and Rudometkin went on to study automotive technology at Evergreen Valley College in San Jose, Peralez said. Then Rudometkin entered an automotive-skills and trouble-shooting competition and won the top prize: a job at a Ford dealership, Peralez said. Rudometkin was hired at the VTA about eight years ago after a friend who worked there suggested he apply. Rudometkin worked as a train mechanic for the light rail system, and became certified as an overhead line technician, Peralez said. “He was just very dedicated. He took everything he did very seriously. He loved challenges,” Peralez said. And Rudometkin was always ready to apply his skills to the vehicles of his family and friends — and sometimes even their friends, Peralez said. “I can’t count the number of times he’s worked on my car, my parents’ cars, my sister’s,” Peralez said. His life-long friend was always up to a technical challenge, Peralez said. “He loved to do this stuff himself, whereas most people including myself would call people, even if he didn’t know how to do it, he’d try to learn.” Related Articles

Rudometkin owned several motorcycles, Peralez said. “He loved motorcycle riding, but he also loved the tinkering.

276,https://www.rawstory.com/matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-rallies/,"On Thursday, as Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wrapped up the latest stop of the ""America First"" tour, conservative commentator Matt Lewis scorched the pair of them as a ""traveling freak show"" in The Daily Beast — and predicted that even former President Donald Trump, who popularized their political style, would end up losing control of what he has created. ""Gaetz hit the stage first, throwing out a bunch of populist, demagogic rhetoric ('forever wars,' 'socialism,' 'rebuild America,' 'world's policeman,' 'deep state') and pandering ('gun control just means we have a steady aim!'). He took shots at the Bushes and the McCains and the Romneys and James Comey and Anthony Fauci,"" wrote Lewis. ""Not to be upstaged, Greene entered the room in a humvee, before making her way on stage, grinning from ear to ear ... She feigned the Mexican accent of a supposed cartel leader talking about how much he loved Joe Biden, who she said wants a ""woke"" military. She also called the Squad 'the Jihad Squad' and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 'O'Crazyo-Cortez.' Really classy stuff."" The rally even pivoted into seditionist rhetoric, with Gaetz suggesting the Second Amendment creates the right to the violent overthrow of the government — just days after a horrific mass shooting. Ultimately, wrote Lewis, this is as much a danger to Trump as it is to anyone else. ""Over time, Trump is in danger of having what happened to Sarah Palin happen to him,"" wrote Lewis. ""At one point, Palin was the only game in town. She was the hot commodity. But once she left her position as governor of Alaska, she became irrelevant. It took a couple of years, but a generation of younger, more relevant, imitators supplanted her. Now, Trump is a better marketer than Palin and he was, after all, the president. Still, you can see why he has to at least feign a 2024 run — and why he has already announced he will be doing more of his own rallies."" ""The Matt Gaetz-Marjorie Taylor Greene event was one-third tent revival, one-third rock concert, and one-third circus — and it was all a freak show,"" concluded Lewis. ""This is all to say it was a rollicking success in today's Republican Party. Expect other MAGA-types to start replicating this idea. The devils went down to Georgia."" President Bashar al-Assad was sworn in Saturday for seven more years after a controversial May election dismissed by Europe and the US as ""neither free nor fair"". His new term extends the Assad family's rule to almost six decades; Assad's father Hafez al-Assad led Syria for some 30 years. President Bashar al-Assad took the oath of office for a fourth term in war-ravaged Syria Saturday, after taking 95 percent of the vote in a controversial election dismissed abroad.        Veteran American civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson will on Monday be awarded France's highest order of merit, the Legion of Honour, President Emmanuel Macron's office said. ""Jesse Jackson never stopped campaigning for peace, justice and fraternity. He is also committed to education and climate,"" Macron's office said Friday, adding that the ceremony would take place in the Elysee Palace.     President Joe Biden said Friday that social media misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccinations is ""killing people"" and the White House said Facebook needs to clean up its act. ""They're killing people. The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they're killing people,"" Biden told reporters at the White House, as he left for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David.                    Copyright © 2021 Raw Story Media, Inc.

He had weapons. He read up on terrorism and manifestos. He harbored bomb-making materials. He rigged his home to go up in an inferno as he set out to kill nine fellow employees at a light-rail hub in San Jose. While he plotted intricately for a mass attack, appearing like a terrorist on a mission, his motive was much simpler: He just hated his co-workers. That's the picture painted so far by law enforcement as detectives try to understand the pent-up animosity that Cassidy appears to have kindled for a decade against the people he worked alongside. Cassidy, described by those who knew him as having alcohol issues, for years talked about his hatred of his workplace at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub. The details make clear the suspect employed tactics not routinely seen in mass shootings. ""It really stands out when you have an individual like this who goes to such extreme steps,"" said Ed Davis, a former commissioner for the Boston Police Department who helped lead the investigation into the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. ""You have people with these burdens of something that was done to them and they fixate on them and it ends up turning into a decade-long vendetta."" Read about the victims: He tried to warn his co-workers, then he was shot: Loved ones mourn victims of shooting at San Jose rail yard Long before Wednesday's attack, Cassidy ranted about his job and co-workers — even threatening to kill. Two women — an ex-wife of 10 years and an ex-girlfriend — offered a glimpse at Cassidy's past, detailing his anger and alcohol issues, along with previous threats of workplace violence. Cecilia Nelms, who was married to Cassidy for about 10 years before they filed for divorce in 2005, told The Mercury News Cassidy had ""two sides."" She said he often was angry at co-workers and about his assignments at work. She told the outlet Cassidy thought the VTA was unfair with its work assignments, though she said she hasn't spoken with him in about more than a decade. 'Enough': Biden urges Congress to pass gun control bills after lowering flag for latest mass shooting 'What the hell is wrong with us': California Gov. Gavin Newsom asks after the San Jose shooting ""He had two sides,"" Nelms told The Mercury News. ""When he was in a good mood he was a great guy. When he was mad, he was mad."" She told the Associated Press he'd ""dwell on things"" and had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. ""I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,"" Nelms said through tears. Another woman who dated Cassidy accused him in court documents in 2009 of rape and sexual assault. The filing, obtained by The Mercury News, also includes accusations that Cassidy had severe mood swings and suffered from alcohol abuse. Neighbors of Cassidy described him as quiet, strange and a bit of a loner, saying he didn't talk to others and seemed unfriendly. Doug Suh, who lives across the street from Cassidy, told USA TODAY Cassidy had lived in the area for 20 years but despite his roots there, never wanted anything to do with his neighbors. He said he'd tried to talk with Cassidy multiple times, saying hello and offering other pleasantries, but wouldn’t get much of a response. ""Every time I say hi, he’s ignored me,"" Suh said. “I was surprised though...I didn’t think he was going to ... kill people like that."" Suh added to The Mercury News, Cassidy was ""lonely"" and ""strange."" He never appeared to have visitors. Once, Cassidy yelled at him to stay away as he was backing up his car. “After that, I never talked to him again,"" Suh told the newspaper. In 2016 — five years before the mass attack — Cassidy was stopped on a trip back from the Philippines by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. A Department of Homeland Security memo from the stop, which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, includes that an officer found Cassidy had ""books about terrorism and fear and manifestos ... as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA."" A Biden administration official said he saw the memo and confirmed its contents to The Associated Press. The memo doesn’t say why Cassidy was stopped after his 2016 trip. It notes the gunman had a ""minor criminal history"" and cites a 1983 incident where he was arrested in San Jose and charged with ""misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer."" A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the memo to USA TODAY. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, did not respond to repeated questions about whether they were notified about the 2016 stop or investigated Cassidy afterward. Cassidy left his home around 5:39 a.m., armed with a duffel bag and what experts say was a plan to never return. Before he left, he set a timer or slow-burn device to set his two-story on fire, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. The fire was reported minutes after the first 911 calls came in about the shooting at the rail facility. Footage captured by news helicopters showed law enforcement sifting through debris in the backyard of the beige home throughout Wednesday afternoon. The back of the home appeared to have the most visible damage with the roof charred and debris thrown in the yard. ""Everyone of these killers are different but it's clear he wanted to express his rage on others but also wanted to destroy himself -- and that included his home,"" said Dr. Ziv Cohen, a forensic and clinical psychiatrist who consults on murder cases and serves as an expert witness in criminal trials. Cohen noted it's possible the suspect may have been attempting to destroy evidence, but it was clear he didn't plan to return. ""I don't really think I remember a specific example like this one where a person destroyed their home,"" he said. Cassidy fired 39 shots during his rampage through two buildings at the sprawling VTA hub and appeared to target some of the victims, Smith told the Associated Press in an interview. Smith said the shooter told at least one person: “I’m not going to shoot you” during the attack. The gunman then shot other people before he shot himself as deputies closed in. More on the shooting: Gunman targeted some victims in San Jose rail yard shooting, sheriff says; 9th victim dies Timeline of the attack: Officers rushed into San Jose rail yard as gunshots were still ringing out As authorities cleared the rail yard Wednesday, they found an assortment of what appeared to be bomb-making materials in Cassidy's locker — forcing a lockdown of the area and bomb technicians to sweep the large complex. Smith told NBC's ""Today"" Cassidy's locker had “materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive,” Smith said. The Sheriff's Office told The Mercury News the contents of the locker were later deemed to not be dangerous and no actual explosive devices were discovered. Sheriff’s Deputy Russell Davis said Cassidy had three semi-automatic 9mm handguns along with 32 high-capacity magazines loaded with additional ammunition. In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy had obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would be allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. Despite accusations from two women — an ex-wife and ex-girlfriend — that Cassidy was violent, had alcohol problems and was sexually abusive, there was nothing in public records to indicate Cassidy ever got in trouble with the law, meaning he likely was legally able to obtain a firearm. Authorities have yet to say whether that was the case or when Cassidy obtained the firearms. He received a traffic ticket in 2019 and sheriff’s officials said they were still investigating his background. His social media presence - if he had one - is not apparent. Cohen noted the details, from the accusations of violence to his lengthy vendetta against his workplace, signal Cassidy fits the typical mass shooter profile. He detailed the alcohol abuse, sexual violence, signs of lengthy planning and built-up hatred are often found in mass killers. But, he said, there are plenty of people across the U.S. who show similar warning signs and do not commit mass murder. Cassidy, he said, appeared to want to make a statement in Wednesday's attack and attempted to employ multiple factors, from potential bomb-making materials to a fire, to ensure his rage was expressed. ""Clearly, he appeared to be experimenting with some of these materials,"" Cohen said. ""We should be very thankful it wasn't worse."" Both Cohen and Davis, the former Boston Police Commissioner, said the case reminded them of the 2012 Aurora, Colo. movie theater shooting. The gunman in that attack, which killed 12, attempted to booby trap his home before the shooting. ""When you deconstruct what happened, you realize that there were a lot of warning signs with people like this,"" Davis said. The problem, though, is law enforcement comes into contact with many people who have similar signs. ""The challenge is we live in a free society. We cannot simply take action against someone who is showing indicators that something might happen,"" he added. ""It's hard because a crime has to happen before an arrest. You can't always anticipate behavior.""

Then came the screams. And then — silence. “Hey, what’s going on? Anybody all right?

But all he found were bodies. “There wasn't helping anybody,"" the 64-year-old said, choking up. “He made sure they were all dead. I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breath. And they were all gone.” The massacre was the worst mass shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area in decades. Gunman Samuel James Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA employee, opened fire Wednesday morning at the San Jose rail yard, killing         eight people before shooting himself. A ninth victim died hours later in the hospital. Bertolet, who works in the signals department, said he had a polite relationship with Cassidy when they would pass in the locker room or hallway. He described “Sam” as an outsider at the facility, a loner who sat by himself, never talked to anyone and never fit in. He appeared to target specific coworkers, Bertolet said. “I understand what pushed him. Sam was always on the outside. He was never in the group. He was never accepted by anybody,"" Bertolet said Thursday during an interview with The Associated Press. “You look back and you go, ‘yeah, it fits.’ ” In the hours after the violence, more pieces began to fit together: Cassidy’s ex-wife said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments more than a decade ago. A Biden administration official, speaking on the condition of authority, said Cassidy spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines. He had even talked about killing people at work, his ex-wife Cecilia Nelms told The Associated Press. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” she said tearfully. Friends and relatives remembered the victims as a loving, kind-hearted and heroic group, and VTA officials have called the workforce of more than 2,100 a family. While Bertolet criticized the facility's lax security and said he wished he had had his own gun to stop Cassidy, he also told a different story of men who had worked together every day. “I know some of those guys, they’ll keep joking with you and they’ll keep hammering you about stuff,” he said, adding that anyone “thin-skinned” might not have been able to handle it. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said Cassidy appeared to choose his targets. He told at least one person “I'm not going to shoot you” and opened fire on others. Bertolet told of a similar scenario. “He was pissed off at certain people. He was angry, and he took his vengeance out on very specific people. He shot people. He let others live,"" he said. “It was very personal. Very targeted."" Authorities have not speculated on a motive beyond characterizing Cassidy on Thursday as a “highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees."" Glenn Hendricks, chair of the VTA’s Board of Directors, said Thursday that he had no information about any tensions between Cassidy and the coworkers he shot. “VTA is a close family,"" Hendricks said. ""I would let the investigation work itself out.” The investigation is complicated. It spans two crime scenes — Cassidy apparently had a device that would set his home on fire almost simultaneously to when he began shooting — and has 100 potential witnesses who were working at the railyard at the time. Cassidy arrived at the rail yard around 6 a.m., carrying a duffel bag filled with three semi-automatic handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines. It's not clear exactly when the bloodshed began, but the first 911 call reporting an active shooter came at 6:34 a.m. “We were sitting in the front of our office and we started hearing the pops,"" Bertolet said. ""BANG. BANG. BANG, BANG, BANG.” He and his coworkers threw a table in front of the door as Bertolet called the facility's control center while the shooting continued. The gunshots caused Rochelle Hawkins, a VTA mechanic, to drop her cellphone in the tumult. “I was running so fast, I just ran for my life,” she said. One of the victims, Taptejdeep Singh, tried to save his friend before Cassidy turned the guns on him. “Taptejdeep called me to warn me that there was an active shooter in Building B and to go hide or get out immediately,"" Sukhvir Singh said. Sukhvir Singh survived. His friend did not. ——— Dazio reported from Los Angeles and Gecker from San Francisco.

The 57-year-old man was unhappy with his job at Valley Transportation Authority according to various accounts, including his ex-wife who said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. Sheriff Smith said the gunman also appeared to have set a timer or slow-burn device to set his home on fire. That fire was reported just minutes after the first 911 calls came in from the rail facility where yet another mass shooting in America unfolded. ""It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there, I'm not going to shoot you. And then he shot other people,"" Smith said. ""So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot. That's very difficult ...

280,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/27/victims-of-san-jose-mass-shooting-worked-vtas-most-dangerous-jobs/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — Most of the men gunned down at the VTA rail yard worked the most dangerous jobs in the business — handling high voltage wires from high in their bucket trucks, sometimes in the rain and freezing cold, as speeding trains raced by. It was the kind of work, in the kind of conditions, that built a strong bond among the crew as they gathered to receive their daily assignments just after sunrise in the maintenance building. They wore thick blue cotton uniforms to protect themselves from arc flash, a high voltage shock that could melt the skin. Nothing could protect them from the danger among them on Wednesday morning. One of their own — a coworker some considered odd and authorities called “highly disgruntled” — unleashed the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history, spraying a barrage of bullets from three handguns as he made his way from one building to another. He killed himself, authorities say, when police arrived. At an emotional news conference Thursday morning at Valley Transportation Authority headquarters in San Jose, the transit agency’s board members and executives and City Council members struggled to maintain their composure. Several choked up when they spoke and wiped away tears. “Some of us got training on what to do when there is an active shooter event,” VTA general counsel Evelynn Tran said, “but not about the aftermath.” Click here to read more about the nine victims of the San Jose VTA rail yard shootings To honor each victim, she recited their first names one by one: Abdolvahab, Adrian, Alex, Jose, Lars, Michael, Paul, Taptej and Timothy. Their photos graced a poster board up front. No one uttered the name of the shooter. No one would say why Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA maintenance worker, was so angry or whether he had threatened anyone before. The nine men he gunned down during a still-unexplained rampage ranged in age from 29 to 63. Michael Rudometkin was an avid motorcyclist. Alex Fritch built a tiki bar in his backyard for cocktail parties. Lars Lane had such a strong work ethic that his bosses had to discourage him from overdoing it. Taptej Singh liked to organize camping trips for his coworkers. Abdolvahab Alaghmandan was described by his son as “a gentle soul.” Singh, and perhaps others, helped coworkers hide that tragic morning before being killed themselves. They left wives and children, friends and relatives, and a sense of overwhelming grief among their loved ones. “It hasn’t totally set in. You don’t know how to feel,” said San Jose City Councilman Raul Peralez, whose childhood friend, Michael Rudometkin, died in the massacre. “I’ve gone through crying uncontrollably this morning, waking up and looking at photos, then having good memories, and then I start laughing. I’ve been all over the place.” During the news conference, George Sandoval, the maintenance manager, and Naunihal Singh, a superintendent in operations, shared their turmoil and remembered the men who kept the electric trains running. Sandoval was on vacation in Carmel when he got the shocking call. Singh was still at home. They wanted to rush to the rail yard, but everything was locked down. Their voices shook Thursday when they spoke. “Many of these folks worked here for 20, 30 years,” said Sandoval, who lost his own wife, Maureen, a year ago. “Our staff responds to emergencies on the rail, and there’s a bond that occurs. You really do become a family.” The first six who were killed were in the “power department” of Building B. They were all working the morning shift, from 6 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., which started with a meeting before heading into the field to perform maintenance and inspections. Their jobs required a special combination of skills — both electrical and mechanical — that are needed to run the trains connected to overhead power lines. The loss of their lives is tremendous, Sandoval said. Their skills will be difficult to replace. Alaghmandan, 63, called Abdi by his friends, immigrated from Iran in 1995 and was “a wonderful man,” Sandoval said, “always willing to take on any task, trying to improve the system, training new people.” Jose Hernandez III, a 35-year-old substation maintainer, was “very smart, very mechanical” and part of a family tradition working at the VTA, joining his father and uncle who were senior track workers. Timothy Romo, 49, was an overhead line worker and shift foreman who made assignments and coordinated the crew’s work. His loss, Sandoval said, “is just huge.” Fritch, also 49 and a substation manager, was the tiki bar enthusiast. He leaves behind a wife and three children. “He was the life of the party. Always there with a friendly quip, a kind word, or to make a funny face when you’re taking a selfie,” Kevin Crossman wrote on his blog about tiki bars and Mai Tais. Lane, at 63 one of the oldest to die, was unstoppable. He worked at the VTA for 20 years, doing heavy repairs on the overhead system. “He had a true commitment, even when clearly he was tired, we’d literally have to tell him, it’s time for you to go home,” Sandoval said. “He wanted to be there until things were resolved. That was his nature.” Rudometkin, 40, the childhood friend of the city councilman, was also an overhead line worker and was working on improving the apprenticeship program to better train new recruits. Where exactly the first six men were gunned down remains unclear. Authorities said Thursday that the large crime scene involves five distinct areas, including Building B where Cassidy started the rampage and Building A where he ended it after shooting at least two more men before killing himself when police arrived. Adrian Balleza and Taptejdeep Singh, both light rail operators, and Paul Megia, their supervisor, worked in Building A. Naunihal Singh, the transportation superintendent for light rail operations who spoke at the news conference, called the men “a safety valve for each other. They helped each other out.” Singh shared an office with Megia, 42, who started as a bus operator trainee in 2002 and worked his way up to a supervisor role. “He had a calming effect on the office,” Singh said. “I’ve never seen him get mad.” Same thing with Balleza, he said, who was 29, married with a young son and had worked at the VTA for seven years. Singh was eyeing him for a promotion, calling him  “kind-hearted” and “a gem of a guy.” Related Articles

282,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/27/hundreds-gather-to-honor-the-nine-victims-in-vta-mass-shooting/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — They will not be forgotten. That was the message poignantly delivered Thursday night during a solemn vigil in downtown San Jose honoring the nine men killed in the Bay Area’s largest ever mass shooting early Wednesday morning in a San Jose VTA light rail yard. Hundreds of mourners gathered in San Jose City Hall Plaza to pay their respects to the victims and call for an end to senseless violence. Among the crowd were dozens of VTA employees dressed in work attire and family members of those who had lost a loved one. “These aren’t names to us. These are people we know and we love and we see every single day of our working lives. It really, really hurts down to the very core of our souls,” said John Courtney, president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 265, which represents VTA workers. “So please, ATU, let’s do what we do, stand for each other, by each other. Let’s love each other.” San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo began the vigil, after a rendition of Over the Rainbow played over the speakers, slowly reading off the names of the nine victims — Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptej Singh, 36; Adrian Belleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michel Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. A moment of silence followed, then remarks from elected officials, VTA representatives and religious leaders — and finally, words from those most affected, the family members of the nine men who lost their lives. “We’re here to share our pain, to share our love and to share our support for each other in the difficult road ahead,” Liccardo said. “Here in Santa Clara County we grieve together and, more importantly, we will heal together.” Megia’s wife, Nicole, who addressed the crowd toward the end of the vigil, said she “never thought in a million years” that she would be standing on a podium, looking out at the crowd in front of her. “God took my best friend, my husband, too soon and I’m wishing I could give him one last hug,” she said. Singh’s brother, Karmen, told the families of the other victims that he knew what they were going through and that he was there for them. “Whatever we can do, we need to support each other going forward,” he said. “Show the unity — regardless of race or color or where we come from — that we stand together and that these things won’t occur ever again and nobody has to lose their loved one.” Annette Romo, the wife of Tim Romo, fought back tears to pass along one final message to the crowd: “Never leave your home without giving your loved one a kiss goodbye,” she said, “because that was the last I got.” Some attendees in the crowd added flowers to a small memorial set up at the front of the plaza, which included candles and photographs of the victims. Others wore shirts with the victims photos or brought posters with messages like “Stop the Hate.” Though they aren’t officially part of the VTA family, Jenna and Steve Naylor, of Campbell, felt the loss deeply. Attending the vigil along with their two sons, Benjamin, 4, and Louis, 3, the Naylors carried makeshift signs that read “we love VTA.” During the pandemic, the Naylors would go on almost daily walks from their home to the downtown light rail tracks to see the “choo choos,” as their sons called the trains. When photographs of the victims were released late Wednesday and Thursday, the Naylors said in an interview that they thought they recognized one of the men as a train conductor who regularly honked and waved at the family as he went through downtown Campbell.

Trinity Ottoson-Smith, a 9-year-old girl who was shot in the head by a stray bullet while jumping on a trampoline in Minneapolis nearly two weeks ago, has died, according to reports. Trinity died from her injuries Thursday. She had been in critical condition in a hospital since the shooting, family members told FOX 9 of Minneapolis. ""For the last 12 days, she fought for her life and today that fight ended,"" Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said. ""At 4:04 p.m. she was pronounced deceased at the hospital."" MINNEAPOLIS ACTIVIST WHOSE GRANDDAUGHTER WAS SHOT DEAD SAYS CITY NEEDS POLICE On May 15, Trinity was struck by the stray bullet while jumping on a trampoline at a friend's birthday party in north Minneapolis. The shooter was in a red Ford vehicle that drove off after the gunfire, police said at the time. ""Our officers who showed up at this scene with the 9-year-old girl critically injured with a gunshot to her head knowingly violated policy by picking this girl up, running her to the squad, and taking her to the hospital, doing what they could to save her life. That's who the Minneapolis Police Department is,"" Elder said. She was one of three children who were shot in the head in the city in recent weeks.

Samuel Cassidy, a 57-year-old white man, fired around 40 shots Wednesday at the public transport rail yard where he worked as a maintenance man in San Jose, California. He was not the first US employee to commit mass murder at work, and in a country awash with guns he is unlikely to be the last. From 1970 to 1990, employees or ex-employees of the US Postal System alone killed around 40 people in a series of shooting at mail facilities. Americans invented the term ""going postal"" to describe spasms of violence in the workplace.

The coronavirus pandemic provided a pause in this violence. But as many companies reopened, with this came a return of shootings. In April an employee at a furniture store in Texas shot and killed one person, and a former employee killed eight people at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.When police arrived at the rail yard on Wednesday, Cassidy killed himself. Three semi-automatic pistols and 32 magazines were found on him.""He was very deliberate, very fast; he knew where employees would be,"" Sheriff Laurie Smith told NBC television.
A search this week of Cassidy's home -- which was set ablaze shortly before the attack -- discovered 12 guns, some 22,000 rounds of ammunition, and suspected Molotov cocktails, Smith said in a statement Friday.His motive has yet to be determined.

288,https://www.gazettenet.com/San-Jose-gunman-faced-disciplinary-hearing-before-mass-shooting-sources-say-40702666,"A man looks at a memorial at City Hall in San Jose, Calif., Thursday, May 27, 2021, in honor of the multiple people killed when a gunman opened fire at a rail yard the day before. (AP Photo/Nic Coury)  Nic Coury Wednesday’s mass shooting at a Valley Transit Authority rail yard in San Jose claimed the lives of nine people and left the community in shock. Now authorities are sifting through the wreckage looking to understand why — and how — the gunman committed the horrific attack. Evidence has painted a picture of the assailant, 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy, as a disgruntled VTA worker who hated his job. And emerging reports Friday indicate that he may have been facing a disciplinary hearing at the agency where he worked as a maintenance worker for the last eight years. Law enforcement sources said Cassidy faced a disciplinary proceeding after he made racial comments to co-workers. According to NBC News, he was scheduled to attend a hearing Wednesday, the day of the attack. Representatives for VTA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Some who worked with Cassidy described him as a loner at the agency. “Sam was definitely outside the group,” said Kirk Bertolet, 64, a 12-year VTA employee who was on duty at the time of the shooting. “I never once saw him sitting at a table with co-workers talking or doing anything. He was always beside himself doing something, and never interacted.” Bertolet said the workplace was composed of blue-collar workers who were sometimes tough on each other. “Sometimes, if you’re a little thin-skinned, maybe you don’t fit in,” he said. The nature of the attack was deliberate, methodical and targeted, the investigation has revealed. Witnesses have said Cassidy appeared to pass over some people while selecting others. “Based on recent developments in the investigation, we can say that the suspect has been a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years, which may have contributed to why he targeted VTA employees,” Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Deputy Russell Davis said Thursday. Several agencies, including the San Jose police and fire departments, the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were assisting the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office with the investigation at the crime scene and at Cassidy’s home on Angmar Court, where a fire ignited just minutes after the shooting began. Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith has said he likely used a detonator device to ignite the fire at the same time as the shooting. FBI officials on Friday morning confirmed that investigators also found intact Molotov cocktails inside Cassidy’s home. Explosive materials were also found in Cassidy’s locker at the VTA rail yard in the hours after the shooting. Cassidy, who authorities said took his own life when deputies confronted him, was armed with three semiautomatic 9-millimeter handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines loaded with additional ammunition. Officials said he fired 39 shots. Security video released by authorities showed Cassidy at the VTA rail yard walking calmly between the two buildings where the victims were shot Wednesday morning.  A VTA clerical worker, who wished to remain anonymous because she was advised not to speak to the media, said the first building houses the ways, power and signal team and the second building includes operations and light rail maintenance. Based on the first building’s layout and exit locations, she said, the victims would have had “nowhere to go.” “They didn’t deserve this,” she said through tears. “They were just good guys who loved their families, who just wanted to go to work and go home every day.” At a vigil Thursday evening, hundreds of people mourned for the victims, who ranged in age from 29 to 63. They have been identified as Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. Karman Singh recalled how his brother, Taptejdeep, 36, would joke that he looked younger than Singh, despite being six years older. He often came to Taptejdeep for help, Singh said, describing how his brother “shielded me from responsibilities of this world.” Whatever trouble he was in, “he was my first call,” Singh said. Other families described similarly close relationships with the loved ones they lost. Audrey, the daughter of Timothy Michael Romo, 49, said her dad would often call her his “favorite little girl,” to which she would playfully respond, “I’m your only little girl.” Romo’s son, Scott, said that his father had been “everything I ever wanted to be as a man.” “He was my superman, and I’ll never not miss him,” he said. One victim, 49-year-old Alex Ward Fritch, died in a hospital after the attack. His wife, Terra Fritch, said she was by his side when died. “We had one of those very special relationships that I think most people just dream of,” she told The Times. “We were never really apart. And if he was somewhere without me, it was definitely noticed. Like, where is the other half?” The couple was supposed to renew their vows in Hawaii for their 20th wedding anniversary in September. “Alex loved dirt bikes, tiki bars and “most of all, luckily, he loved me,” she said. During the vigil, San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo read the victims’ names, pausing a few seconds before each one. He spoke about how healing would be a long and hard journey for many. “We’re here to share our pain, we’re here to share our love, to share our support for each other,” he said. “We’re here to express a singular message in our community: We will heal, and we will heal together.” Victims’ support funds have been set up through Working Partnership USA and the Amalgamated Transit Union. ‘Housing takes time’: Northampton homeless settlers defy city deadline to move NORTHAMPTON — In November’s election, voters will be asked to choose two Trustees Under the Will of Charles E.

289,https://www.theroot.com/san-jose-shooter-faced-disciplinary-hearing-for-racist-1846990900,"The gunman who shot and killed nine Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) co-workers before killing himself was under investigation for reportedly making racist remarks to coworkers. According to NBC Bay Area, Samuel Cassidy, 57, had been accused of making inappropriate racist remarks to co-workers while working as a maintenance worker at VTA. He was scheduled to attend a disciplinary hearing on the day of the attack. Authorities claim that Cassidy had been described as “a highly disgruntled VTA employee for many years” and noted that he often boasted to co-workers that he had guns and explosives. It is unclear whether police were notified before the shooting of Cassidy’s history. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Cassidy was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and questioned in 2016 after they found books on terrorism and a notebook filled with writings on his hatred for VTA. Cassidy’s ex-wife Cecilia Yolanda Nelms told NBC Bay Area that “he had talked about killing co-workers during their ten year marriage that ended in 2004, but she said she didn’t take those comments seriously and was stunned to hear about the rampage. “I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,” she said. From NBC Bay Area: More than 50 federal agents, some from as far as FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, have since converged on the Guadalupe maintenance yard at 101 W. Younger Avenue and what was left of the shooter’s burned out home on Angmar Court in South San Jose, searching for signs of explosives and other evidence. So far, authorities have seized three semiautomatic handguns and 32 illegal high-capacity 12-round magazines. Authorities found “materials for bombs, detonator cords, the precursors to an explosive,” at one rail yard locker, [Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie] Smith said, adding there was evidence the shooter had used a timer device to delay setting fire to his home. Smith also noted that the deputies arrival prevented more deaths. “When our deputies went through the door, initially he was still firing rounds,” she said. “When our deputy saw him, he took his life.” White men will boast and brag about killing people for decades with physical and tangible evidence and relatives, employers, and state and Federal law enforcement with dismiss and laugh it off like it’s a joke.",2021-05-28 10:02:00,San Jose Shooter Faced Disciplinary Hearing for Racist Remarks on Day of Attack: Report,,368082,http://theroot.com/

The problem with that complaint, though, is that it’s not actually true at all. For instance, on virtually any given day on Facebook, i.e. the biggest social media platform in the world, the top-performing posts are from conservatives, and very often they have a lock on the top 10. But setting aside the actual reality of the situation, let’s pretend for a moment that these private companies did have a bias against right-wing viewpoints. Some might say the appropriate recourse would be to protest against them and then...get on with one’s life? Or protest them ad nauseam! Of course, when we say protest, we mean with words and perhaps even petitions, and not by going out and shooting a bunch of Silicon Valley executives, as Rep. Matt Gaetz seemingly suggested on Thursday night. Speaking at an “America First” rally in Georgia, the Florida Republican lawmaker told the crowd assembled that they “have an obligation” to take up arms against tech companies, one day after yet another mass shooting occurred in the U.S. “The internet’s hall monitors out in Silicon Valley, they think they can suppress us, discourage us. Maybe if you’re just a little less patriotic, maybe if you just conform to their way of thinking a little more, then you’ll be allowed to participate in the digital world,” Gaetz told the crowd. “Well, you know what? Silicon Valley can’t cancel this movement, or this rally, or this congressman. We have a Second Amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it.” He then went on to define the Second Amendment as giving citizens “the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government of the United States, if that becomes necessary.” View on Twitter Following Gaetz’s comments, which, again, appeared to extremely unsubtly encourage conservatives to shoot tech execs and/or their employees, California rep. Ted Lieu called for the Florida lawmaker to be removed from his post on the House Judiciary Committee. Republican representative Adam Kinzinger suggested Gaetz should be punished for the outrageous remarks, tweeting, “This is not speech protected by the first amendment. This is beyond yelling fire in a theater.” As for Gaetz’s claim that he is personally being canceled, that might have less to do with him being conservative than it does with the Justice Department investigation into his allegedly paying women for sex and, separately, sleeping with a minor and transporting her across state lines. Earlier this month his close friend and wingman, Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty to an array of charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, a turn of events that is unlikely to be good news for Gaetz. While the plea agreement did not identify Gaetz by name, it laid out how Greenberg paid women for sex not just with him but unnamed “others.” According to The Washington Post, the Florida congressman—who reportedly sought a blanket pardon from Donald Trump, though Trump has denied this—repeatedly boasted of the “access to women that Joel provided him.” The two men seemingly left a digital paper trail on Venmo and other online payment platforms for the sex crimes they allegedly committed together. In April, after news broke that Greenberg would likely cooperate with the feds, a reporter asked his lawyer, Fritz Scheller, “Does Matt Gaetz have anything to worry about?” After hysterically laughing, Scheller responded, “I’m sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today.” — How the University of Iowa Became Ground Zero for the Cancel Culture Wars— Inside the New York Post’s Bogus-Story Blowup— The Mothers of 15 Black Men Killed by Police Remember Their Losses— “I Can’t Abandon My Name”: The Sacklers and Me— This Secretive Government Unit Is Saving American Lives Around the World— Trump’s Inner Circle Is Terrified the Feds Are Coming for Them Next— Why Gavin Newsom Is Thrilled About Caitlyn Jenner’s Run for Governor— Can Cable News Pass the Post-Trump Test?— From the Archive: The Life Breonna Taylor Lived, in the Words of Her Mother— Not a subscriber?

The mass shooter's motive remains unclear, but officials have identified the victims. Stephanie Sy takes a moment to remember those lost. Judy Woodruff: And the investigation continues tonight in the rail yard shooting that killed nine people in San Jose, California. The motive remains unclear, but officials have identified the victims. Stephanie Sy has a remembrance. Stephanie Sy: Thirty-six-year-old Taptejdeep Singh spent his final moments trying to keep others safe, his family said. A husband and father to two, Taptejdeep was committed to serving others. Michael Rudometkin started at VTA as a mechanic, before becoming an overhead line worker. The 40-year-old was described on Facebook as a great friend. Jose Hernandez III lived life with zest, his family told the Associated Press. He was described by his father as a man with many friends. Jose was 35.

295,https://www.alternet.org/2021/05/gun-loopholes/,"As our country continues to open up, mass shootings are making the news again. On March 16, a man went on a shooting spree against Asian women, killing eight people in Atlanta. On March 22, a man killed 10 people in a grocery store parking lot in Boulder, Colo. On April 15, a man killed nine in a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. On May 9, a man opened fire at a birthday party, killing seven in Colorado Springs. This week, on May 26, a man killed 10 people at a San Jose, Calif., transit center. And these are the stories that made the news. According to the Gun Violence Archive, which includes gun incidents in which no one dies in their definition of a mass shooting, there have been 232 mass shootings and 15 mass murders since January 1. What may surprise people is that while we heard about mass shootings less during the covid pandemic, it was actually the deadliest year for gun violence in decades. There were 610 mass shootings and 21 mass murders last year. So why didn't we hear them? Because most mass shootings are domestic violence incidents occurring in the home. According to one study that defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot and killed, excluding the shooter, 61 percent between 2009-2018 occurred entirely in the home. Another 10 percent occurred in a home and in public. The majority of children and teens who die as a result of mass shootings don't die in school; 72 percent died in a mass shooting involving domestic violence. At least 54 percent of mass shootings included at least one intimate partner or family member as a victim. The connection between mass shootings and domestic violence gets stronger when you include men who have histories of domestic violence and become mass shooters. An analysis of 749 mass shootings between 2014 and 2019 found almost 60 percent of mass shooters either were committing domestic violence or had a history of domestic violence before the mass shooting. An ex-girlfriend of the San Jose shooter who killed 10 people this week accused him of rape and intimate partner violence. While I could not find a statistic on the percentage of gun deaths each year that are domestic violence related, we do know that a gun in the home makes it five times more likely a domestic violence situation will be deadly and domestic violence assaults involving a gun are 12 times more likely to result in death than assaults with other weapons or bodily force. Women in the United States are 21 times more likely to be killed by a gun than in other high-income countries and nearly half of all women homicide victims are killed as a result of intimate partner violence. While domestic violence is a deadly threat to women in a country with so much access to firearms, it is mostly discussed in relation to mass shootings when the shooter also kills people outside the home. Much of the increase in gun deaths in 2020 is a result of domestic violence and people being stuck in the home. However, without the spectacle of the public mass shooting the media mostly ignored gun deaths last year. The narrative about returning to normalcy has also included concern about returning to mass shootings, ignoring the prevalence of domestic violence shootings last year. In 1997, Congress passed a law, often called ""the Lautenberg Amendment,"" prohibiting anyone convicted of domestic violence from owning a firearm. Unfortunately, loopholes allow a domestic abuser to legally purchase guns. One issue with the law is that it only applies if the abuser has been married, lived with, or had children with his victim. Therefore, those convicted of assaulting a dating partner or a stalking victim can still pass a background check and legally purchase a gun. This has been dubbed ""the boyfriend loophole."" As of 2018, only 27 states have passed laws to address it. Many abusers can legally purchase firearms, because their convictions are never entered into the federal database. This must be done manually. State databases don't automatically populate the federal one. This oversight led to the killing of 26 people in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church in 2017. The shooter, Devin Patrick Kelley, was convicted of domestic abuse in 2012 while in the Air Force. He should have been barred from legally purchasing guns in 2017 but the Air Force said his convictions had not been entered into the National Criminal Information Center database. There are also gun sales when a background check isn't required. Private sellers are allowed to sell guns without running background checks. This is particularly common at gun shows. If the background check system doesn't immediately make a determination, and three days pass without the FBI continuing to investigate, the gun can be sold in what is called a ""default proceed"" sale. This is also referred to as the ""Charleston loophole"" after the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting. Improving our societal response to domestic violence and improving our societal commitment to keeping guns away from domestic abusers has the potential to drastically lower gun deaths in this country and limit the number of mass shooters. Seventy-five percent of mass shooters use a legally purchased gun and, as previously said, 60 percent of mass shooters have a history of domestic violence. Everytown for Gun Safety argues we must strengthen state laws prohibiting domestic abusers from owning guns, improve implementation and enforcement of existing laws, closing the previously mentioned loopholes, improving domestic violence records, requiring gun dealers to notify law enforcement when a convicted abuser attempts to buy a gun, and funding research on domestic violence and gun violence. I argue we must do all that but we also must take domestic violence as a societal problem more seriously at the first warning sign to ensure domestic abusers get a conviction and are guaranteed to fail a background check.

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) After delays, GOP poised to block bipartisan 1/6 riot probe WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans are poised to block the creation of a special commission to study the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, dashing hopes for a bipartisan panel amid a GOP push to put the violent insurrection by Donald Trump's supporters behind them. Broad Republican opposition was expected in what would be the first successful Senate filibuster  of the Biden presidency, even as the family of a Capitol Police officer who collapsed and died after the siege and other officers who battled rioters went office to office asking GOP senators to support the commission. The insurrection was the worst attack on the Capitol in 200 years and interrupted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's win over Trump. A vote on the procedural motion was bumped to Friday after delays on an unrelated bill to boost scientific research and development pushed back the schedule. Though the Jan. 6 commission bill passed the House earlier this month with the support of almost three dozen Republicans, GOP senators said they believe the commission would eventually be used against them politically. And former President Trump, who still has a firm hold on the party, has called it a ""Democrat trap."" The expected vote is emblematic of the profound mistrust between the two parties since the siege, which has sowed deeper divisions on Capitol Hill even though lawmakers in the two parties fled together from the rioters that day. The events of Jan. 6 have become an increasingly fraught topic among Republicans as some in the party have downplayed the violence and defended the rioters who supported Trump and his false insistence that the election was stolen from him. ___ Horror, heroism mark deadly shooting at California rail yard SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Taptejdeep Singh died trying to save others from a gunman. Kirk Bertolet saw some of his coworkers take their last breaths. And friends, family and survivors were left to mourn after nine men died this week when a disgruntled coworker hauling a duffle bag full of guns and ammunition opened fire at a Northern California rail yard complex, apparently choosing his targets and sparing others. Samuel Cassidy, 57, turned the gun on himself Wednesday morning as sheriff's deputies rushed in at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose. Investigators were still trying to determine Friday what might have set off Cassidy, who for years apparently held a grudge against the workplace he detested. The victims were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. ___ South Africa starts jabs for elderly as virus surge looms ORANGE FARM, South Africa (AP) — Spry and gray-haired, many dressed in their Sunday best or colorful African prints — and all sporting masks — dozens of South Africans aged 60 and over gathered at a government health clinic outside Johannesburg to get their COVID-19 shots. Some looked at vaccine notifications on their mobile phones, others clutched pieces of paper, as the line moved along at a good pace. Eight at a time, they were ushered into a tent where they took seats distanced from each other. ""You are about to receive a vaccine to protect against COVID-19. It is the Pfizer vaccine and it requires two doses,"" said a nurse, speaking the Zulu language to the group at the Orange Farm township clinic, about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of Johannesburg. She described what they should do about possible side effects. ""Amen,"" she said in closing, and the vaccine recipients murmured the same response, as if in church. South Africa is in a race against time to vaccinate as many people as possible amid signs the virus may be surging again with the approach of winter in the Southern Hemisphere, when people spend more time indoors, typically allowing for more spread of disease. It is also a critical front in the fight against the virus in Africa, with South Africa recording 40% of the continent's COVID-19 deaths. ___ 'Our season': Eritrean troops kill, rape, loot in Tigray MEKELE, Ethiopia (AP) — Women who make it to the clinic for sex abuse survivors in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray usually struggle to describe their injuries. But when they can't take a seat and quietly touch their bottoms, the nurses know it's an unspeakable kind of suffering. So it was one afternoon with a dazed, barely conscious 40-year-old woman wrapped in bloodied towels, who had been repeatedly gang-raped anally and vaginally over a week by 15 Eritrean soldiers. Bleeding profusely from her rectum, she collapsed in the street in her village of Azerber, and a group of priests put her on a bus to Mekele. The woman recently broke down in tears as she recounted her ordeal in January at the hands of Eritrean troops, who have taken over parts of the war-torn region in neighboring Ethiopia. The Eritreans often sodomize their victims, according to the nursing staff, a practice that is deeply taboo in the Orthodox Christian religion of Tigray. ""They talked to each other. Some of them: 'We kill her.' Some of them: 'No, no. Rape is enough for her,'"" the woman recalled in Mekele, Tigray's capital. She said one of the soldiers told her: ""This season is our season, not your season. This is the time for us."" Despite claims by both Ethiopia and Eritrea that they were leaving, Eritrean soldiers are in fact more firmly entrenched than ever in Tigray, where they are brutally gang-raping women, killing civilians, looting hospitals and blocking food and medical aid, The Associated Press has found. A reporter was stopped at five checkpoints manned by sometimes hostile Eritrean soldiers dressed in their beige camouflage uniforms, most armed, as gun shots rang out nearby. And the AP saw dozens of Eritrean troops lining the roads and milling around in at least two villages. ___ At 26, Belarus journalist has spent a decade in opposition KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Raman Pratasevich has been part of the Belarus political opposition for over a decade and has long feared the authorities would try to abduct him, even though he was living abroad. The 26-year-old dissident journalist couldn't imagine, however, just how far they would go. Pratasevich, who ran a channel on a messaging app used to organize demonstrations against the iron-fisted rule of President Alexander Lukashenko, left his homeland in 2019 to try to escape the reach of the Belarusian KGB  and ended up in Lithuania. He was charged in absentia for inciting riots, which carries a sentence of 15 years in prison. As he was returning Sunday to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, from Greece with his girlfriend aboard a Ryanair jet, Belarusian flight controllers told the crew to divert to Minsk, citing a bomb threat. Lukashenko scrambled a fighter jet to escort the plane. When it became apparent where the plane was going, a clearly shaken Pratasevich told fellow passengers that he feared execution in Belarus, which still carries out capital punishment. Pratasevich was put on a list of people that Belarus considers terrorists, which could bring the death penalty. He had even joked about it before his arrest, using morbid humor on his Twitter account to describe himself as ""the first journalist-terrorist in history."" ___ Social spending, business tax hike drive $6T Biden budget WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden's $6 trillion budget proposal for next year would run a $1.8 trillion federal government deficit despite a raft of new tax increases on corporations and high-income people designed to pay for his ambitious spending plans. Biden had already announced his major budget initiatives, but during a rollout Friday he will release them as a single proposal to incorporate them into the government's existing budget framework, including Social Security and Medicare. That provides a fuller view of the administration's fiscal posture. Democratic aides disclosed key elements of the Biden plan, speaking on condition of anonymity because the document is not yet public. The whopping deficit projections reflect a government whose steadily accumulating pile of debt has topped $28 trillion after well more than $5 trillion in COVID-19 relief. The government's structural deficit remains unchecked, and Biden uses tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy to power huge new social programs like universal prekindergarten and large subsidies for child care. The budget incorporates the administration's eight-year, $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal and its $1.8 trillion American Families Plan and adds details on his $1.5 trillion request for annual operating appropriations for the Pentagon and domestic agencies. ___ 3 officers face arraignment in Black man's restraint death SEATTLE (AP) — Five weeks after ex-Minneapolis policeman Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering George Floyd, three Washington state officers have been charged in the death of Manuel Ellis: another Black man who pleaded for breath under an officer's knee. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson charged officers Christopher Burbank and Matthew Collins, who are both white, with second-degree murder Thursday after witnesses reported that they attacked Ellis without provocation. Timothy Rankine, who is Asian, faces a charge of first-degree manslaughter. He is accused of kneeling on Ellis' back and shoulder as he died from a lack of oxygen, according to a probable cause statement filed in Pierce County Superior Court. All three were in custody by Thursday evening and were scheduled to be arraigned Friday. Their attorneys did not respond to messages seeking comment. Ellis, 33, died on March 3, 2020 — Tasered, handcuffed and hogtied, with his face covered by a spit hood — just weeks before George Floyd's death triggered a nationwide reckoning on race and policing. ___ Survivor: California shooter was 'outsider' in workplace SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — First, there were gunshots. Then came the screams. And then — silence. ""Hey, what's going on? Anybody all right? What's happening?"" Kirk Bertolet called out to his coworkers at a Northern California rail yard on Wednesday morning. ""It was just eerie."" Cautiously, Bertolet left his barricaded office at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose, hoping he could offer first aid to anyone who needed help. But all he found were bodies. ""There wasn't helping anybody,"" the 64-year-old said, choking up. ""He made sure they were all dead. I watched some of my coworkers breathe their last breath. And they were all gone."" The massacre was the worst mass shooting in the San Francisco Bay Area in decades. Gunman Samuel James Cassidy, a 57-year-old VTA employee, opened fire Wednesday morning at the San Jose rail yard, killing eight people before shooting himself. A ninth victim died hours later in the hospital. ___ In Iraq's iconic marshlands, a quest for endangered otters CHIBAISH, Iraq (AP) — ""Don't move a muscle."" His command cut across the reeds rustling in the wind. On a moonlit embankment several kilometers from shore in Iraq's celebrated southern marshes, everyone stood still. Omar al-Sheikhly shined a flashlight across a muddy patch. ""Nothing,"" he said, shaking his head. His team of five exhaled in unison. The environmentalist spearheaded this midnight expedition through the marshes of Chibaish. It is the latest in a quixotic mission that has spanned nearly two decades: to find any sign of Maxwell's smooth-coated otter, a severely endangered species endemic to Iraq whose precarious existence is vital to the iconic wetlands. Most of al-Sheikhly's pursuits have been in vain; the quick-witted otter has always been one step ahead. But as climate change looms, finding evidence they still exist assumes new importance. Al-Sheikhly is among the conservationists issuing a stark warning: Without quick action to protect the otters, the delicate underwater ecology of the UNESCO protected site will be disrupted, and could all but wither away, putting at risk the centuries-old Iraqi marsh communities that depend on it. At stake is everything: ""We stand to lose our Iraqi heritage,"" said al-Sheikhly, who is the technical director at Iraqi Green Climate Organization. ___ Plague of ravenous, destructive mice tormenting Australians BOGAN GATE, Australia (AP) — At night, the floors of sheds vanish beneath carpets of scampering mice. Ceilings come alive with the sounds of scratching. One family blamed mice chewing electrical wires for their house burning down. Vast tracts of land in Australia's New South Wales state are being threatened by a mouse plague that the state government describes as ""absolutely unprecedented."" Just how many millions of rodents have infested the agricultural plains across the state is guesswork. ""We're at a critical point now where if we don't significantly reduce the number of mice that are in plague proportions by spring, we are facing an absolute economic and social crisis in rural and regional New South Wales,"" Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall said this month. Bruce Barnes said he is taking a gamble by planting crops on his family farm near the central New South Wales town of Bogan Gate. ""We just sow and hope,"" he said. All of our content is free.

300,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/29/opinion-to-prevent-mass-shootings-prevent-suicides/,"Trending: Not much is known about the motives of the gunman who killed nine co-workers at a light rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. But we do know that he took his own life at the scene of the crime. Mass killers saving their last bullet for themselves is a recurring theme. Forty percent of public mass shooters commit suicide, according to the Associated Press/USA Today/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database. The fact that so many public mass shooters are suicidal provides hope that some of these horrific crimes can be prevented by focusing specifically on suicide prevention. Although the common perception is that homicides and mass shootings predominate, about two-thirds of the nearly 40,000 gun deaths annually in the United States are suicides. If we as a nation focus on reducing suicides, not only can we save the lives of many of our loved ones, but we may also avert some mass slaughters in the process. Research has shown that the risk a household member will commit suicide is increased threefold when there is a gun in the home. This is not to say that we need to take guns away from law-abiding gun owners who show no signs of being dangerous. However, lives could be saved by a public education campaign (ideally endorsed by gun-rights organizations) recommending that gun owners: 1) temporarily remove a firearm when a household member is in crisis, and 2) safely secure handguns and long guns bought for sport or protection, especially if there is a minor in the home. In cases where a family member is concerned that a gun owner appears suicidal or likely to harm others, Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws (so-called “Red Flag Laws”) give police a tool to remove guns temporarily. Indiana passed the first ERPO law in 2005 following the murder of a police officer. The Indiana law was considered by authorities in the case of an Indianapolis gunman when his mother raised concerns that he was suicidal, but an ERPO order was not sought because he voluntarily relinquished his gun. As a result, the gunman was later able to legally purchase the gun he used in the FedEx shooting. California’s law, which refers to these orders as Gun Violence Restraining Orders (GVRO), has been in effect since 2016. In the San Jose case, the gunman’s ex-wife was reported as saying he was unhappy with his work environment and had threatened to kill his colleagues. Other signs the gunman was dangerous are emerging: He was reportedly detained by the FBI for carrying terrorist documents and NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit reported he was facing a disciplinary hearing for racist comments. Pursuant to California law, a law enforcement officer, a family member, or an employer may file a GVRO petition. Yet apparently no GVRO was sought in this case. Researchers have found that Indiana’s ERPO law reduced suicides by 7.5%. To date, research has focused on suicide prevention, not murder. However, there are a few documented cases where an ERPO was used to remove a gun from someone who was contemplating a mass shooting. Although we will never know for sure, in at least some of these cases, including the case at the San Jose rail yard, removing the gun may have averted a bloodbath. Related Articles

301,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/29/editorial-on-memorial-day-honor-those-who-died-in-service/,"Trending: Since the founding of America, more than 1 million people have died in service of our country. They came from all walks of life, and regardless of their background, it’s a safe assumption that they hoped, in some way, to make the lives of their loved ones a little better, a little safer, a little freer. On Memorial Day, it’s important to not only honor them but also think about how we can do our part to make our communities and our nation a better place for our families, neighbors and future generations. These are not easy times. The mass shooting in San Jose on Wednesday comes on the heels of a year that has seen massive social and racial unrest, a devastating pandemic and deep political divides that carry the potential to destroy our democracy. But the challenges of today are no less daunting than those faced by previous generations. They met their problems head on and persevered. It’s our job to do the same. Memorial Day was originally known as Decorations Day. The history is sketchy, but the holiday originated in the years following the Civil War. One of the earliest celebrations is believed to have been organized by a group of freed African Americans in Charleston, S.C., after the fall of the Confederacy in 1865. According to David Blight, a Yale University history professor, the Confederate Army used the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club as a prison for Union captives. More than 260 soldiers died at the prison. At the conclusion of the Civil War, one of the first things the freed Black men and women did, Blight said, was to give the Union prisoners a proper burial. Then, on May, 1, 1865, nearly 10,000 freed slaves gathered for a parade to honor those who gave their lives for a cause. History doesn’t record what was said that day, but the experiences of those attending during the war and the uncertainties of the future were even more daunting than those of today. The first formal celebration didn’t occur until May 30, 1868, when Congressman James Garfield helped 5,000 participants decorate the graves of more than 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers who were buried at Arlington Cemetery. It wasn’t until after World War I that Decoration Day became a nationwide day for honoring those who died in all of America’s wars. The tradition of wearing red poppies on the day to symbolize resilience derived from a poem written by Lt. Col. John McCrae to honor the 87,000 allied soldiers who were killed during a battle at Flanders Field in Belgium. Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high.
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields. Decoration Day didn’t officially become Memorial Day after after World War II and the Korean War.  In 1968, in the midst of the Vietnam War, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as a federal holiday on the last Monday in May. The change formally went into effect in 1971 and was designed to honor all those who died in wars. Most people today think of Memorial Day as the unofficial beginning of summer filled with barbecues, picnics and family gatherings. Those events will be especially poignant for those are are able to safely resume those activities this year. In the midst of those celebrations, take a moment to remember how many have died so that we can enjoy the day with such pleasure and comfort. And let’s also devote time to think about what we can do to serve our communities and our country.

302,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/29/the-san-francisco-mass-shooting-that-changed-everything-and-nothing/,"Trending: It was 1993. Bill Clinton was president, Kurt Cobain was touring with Nirvana, the first “Jurassic Park” movie had just been released — and people still felt safe going to work. But that summer, a gunman shattered those feelings of security when he opened fire at a law firm in a high-rise office building in San Francisco’s financial district, killing eight people and sending shockwaves through the country. Until this week, when a disgruntled VTA employee killed nine co-workers at a light rail yard in San Jose, it was the deadliest mass shooting in the Bay Area’s history. The 101 California shooting in 1993 marked a turning point in California’s and the nation’s approach to workplace shootings. It had a ripple effect that experts say forever changed how employers and employees think about workplace safety, paved the way for the passage of dozens of laws and helped turn California into the state with the nation’s strictest gun controls. And yet, to those who lived through the 1993 massacre, this week has felt like a horrific déjà vu, making some wonder what all that effort accomplished. Statistics on workplace gun violence suggest we may be better off, but the sense of despair — if anything — has grown. “Here we are, and nothing’s really changed,” said Thomas Kostic, a lawyer who survived the shooting at 101 California St. by barricading himself in a colleague’s office. Despite all the changes of the past three decades, nothing stopped Samuel James Cassidy from showing up to work at the Valley Transportation Authority on Wednesday morning and massacring nine of his colleagues — one victim died later at the hospital — before killing himself. The shooting claimed men who kept the trains running, loving husbands, fathers and friends who were quick with a joke, and plunged the Bay Area deep into mourning. For some, it brought back harrowing memories of an eerily similar day. On July 1, 1993, Gian Luigi Ferri walked into 101 California St., headed up to the law offices of Pettit & Martin on the 34th floor — the firm had advised him in several real estate deals years earlier — and began shooting. Ferri had fallen on hard times and may have blamed the lawyers there, though that day he appeared to shoot indiscriminately. Back then, key card access, on-site security guards, active shooter drills and other measures spawned by decades of violence were rare in most workplaces. Kostic, who was a senior tax lawyer with the firm, was in a co-worker’s office when he heard a racket that his colleague quickly identified as automatic gunfire. Kostic pushed a sofa in front of the office door and the two men hit the floor. They didn’t come out until a police officer knocked, his gun drawn, his hands shaking. In the moment, Kostic, who is 83 now and retired, didn’t fully process what was happening. But when he returned to the scene shortly after, and saw bullet holes in the windows of his firm’s glass conference room, the full force of what he’d survived hit him. For years after, he couldn’t watch movies with gunfire. “I still jump once in a while,” he said. Immediately after, a group of Kostic’s colleagues started an organization to fight for stricter gun control. It later merged with former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords’ group and became the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By 1994, the lawyers had scored a major victory with the passage of a federal assault weapons ban. The law’s chief sponsor, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said the San Francisco shooting inspired her to push the bill through. “1993 was when the country really started to take this issue seriously,” said Stanford law professor John Donohue III, who specializes in gun violence. The federal law came with a sunset provision, and in 2004, Congress let the ban expire without renewing it. But California retains a collection of tough laws, including a wide-reaching assault weapons ban and a “red flag” law that allows courts to block people from having firearms if they present a risk to themselves or others. “We have probably almost 100 laws that have passed in the 28 years since (the San Francisco shooting),” said Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Giffords Law Center. Victims of the California Street shooting and their families sued Navegar Inc., the Miami-based company that made the guns Ferri used. They lost, but the case made it to the California Supreme Court. In 2001, Navegar went out of business.  California’s strict gun control laws continue to clash with more lenient federal laws, leaving room for shooters potentially to cross state borders, buy guns and ammunition that are illegal in California, and bring them home. In this week’s shooting, Cassidy used three semi-automatic pistols that were legally obtained, but he carried 32 ammunition magazines holding 12 to 15 rounds, which are illegal in California. It was unclear where or how he got the magazines, which California limits to 10 rounds for civilian use. While gun control advocates say that’s a clear indication the country needs stronger federal rules, those on the side of gun owners’ rights say it shows just the opposite. They argue that strict gun laws, which are ignored by killers, leave potential victims with no way to defend themselves. “A big thing that has happened since ’93 and now is every time someone comes up with an idea for gun control, California passes it,” said Mike Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America. “It seems to me that what it shows is that gun control doesn’t work. The state and the country have passed every form of gun control imaginable and has had nothing but a succession of mass shootings, none of which were halted as a result of that gun control.” Society’s notions of what is safe also have shifted dramatically over the past three decades. Back in 1993, no one considered that a stranger might walk into your office with a gun and start shooting, Kostic said. “We didn’t have security on any floor,” he said. “Nobody did in the city. You could enter any floor.” The year of the San Francisco shooting, 204 California workers died by homicide — up 25% from the year before — and violent attacks overtook transportation accidents as the number-one cause of death in a workplace, according to the state’s Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The majority of those homicides — 170 — were shootings. In 1994, the agency took steps to protect workers — launching a pilot program to investigate all workplace homicides and hosting two conferences that led to the creation of new workplace security guidelines. By 2019, the number of workplace homicides in California dropped to 50. Three-quarters of those deaths involved shootings. Related Articles

Today, many office buildings require a security badge or key card to get in the door or use the elevators, and some restrict employees’ access to certain floors. Large offices often require visitors to sign in. When Steve Sposato’s wife, Jody, was killed while giving a deposition at the 101 California St. office, Sposato’s life and entire set of values changed in an instant. A life-long Republican, he shifted gears and dedicated his life to fighting for gun control. He appeared before lawmakers to fight for stricter laws with his then 10-month-old daughter strapped to his back. When he heard there had been another workplace shooting so close to home, his first thought was fury that this keeps happening. “It’s horrific,” Sposato said. “All these people and these families and brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles get to join the club. And it’s a club you don’t want to be a member of.” Impact of the 101 California St. shooting Experts view the 1993 shooting, which left eight people dead in a San Francisco highrise, as a key turning point in California’s and the nation’s gun control debate. — It inspired a federal assault weapons ban that lasted 10 years, until 2004. — Victims of the shooting sued Navegar, the company that made the gun used in the shooting. They lost, but the company went out of business. — Lawyers affected by the shooting founded an organization to fight for gun control, which later became the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit May 28, 2021 | 10:50am				| Updated May 28, 2021 | 12:22pm The San Jose, Calif., mass shooter was set to attend a work disciplinary hearing for alleged racist comments he made on the day he gunned down nine co-workers, according to a report. Samuel James Cassidy, who authorities say killed nine co-workers early Wednesday in two buildings at the Valley Transportation Authority light-rail facility, was the subject of recent complaints by colleagues who claimed he made inappropriate racial remarks on the job as a station maintenance worker, NBC Bay Area reported, citing law enforcement sources. The specific nature of the alleged remarks was not disclosed. Cassidy also told fellow VTA employees that he had guns and explosives, sources close to the ongoing investigation told NBC Bay Area. It’s unclear if authorities were aware of those allegations and whether they were to be discussed at the disciplinary hearing scheduled for Cassidy later Wednesday, according to the report. Santa Clara Sheriff Laurie Smith said Thursday investigators were still working to determine a possible motive in the morning rampage, during which Cassidy was armed with semi-automatic handguns and high-capacity magazines. Smith later told the Associated Press that Cassidy appeared to pick his targets, telling at least one person, “I’m not going to shoot you.” Sheriff’s officials described Cassidy in a statement released late Thursday as a “highly disgruntled” VTA employee for many years, which could have factored into his attack. He had been employed there since at least 2012, public records show. “The investigation into motive remains ongoing and no additional information is available at this time,” the statement read. Detectives were continuing to conduct interviews and review video and cellphone evidence to determine Cassidy’s motive, sheriff officials said. One VTA worker told the Associated Press on Thursday that Cassidy kept to himself at the facility and appeared to target specific colleagues. “I understand what pushed him,” said Kirk Bertolet, 64, who initially barricaded in his office as the gunfire erupted. “Sam was always on the outside. He was never in the group. He was never accepted by anybody. You look back and you go, ‘Yeah, it fits.’” Bertolet said Cassidy was “pissed off” at certain co-workers. “He was angry, and he took his vengeance out on very specific people,” Bertolet said. “He shot people. He let others live … It was very personal. Very targeted.” Cassidy also had a black memo book packed with “lots of notes” detailing his hatred of his workplace, according to a Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the Wall Street Journal. Cassidy had the book with him when Customs and Border Protection officials detained him in 2016 upon returning from the Philippines. But he denied having “problems with anybody at work” at the time, according to the report. Read Next Oh heel no! Jill Biden helped by officers after shoe gets ...

308,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/29/opinion-to-prevent-mass-shootings-prevent-suicides/,"Trending: Not much is known about the motives of the gunman who killed nine co-workers at a light rail yard in San Jose on Wednesday. But we do know that he took his own life at the scene of the crime. Mass killers saving their last bullet for themselves is a recurring theme. Forty percent of public mass shooters commit suicide, according to the Associated Press/USA Today/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database. The fact that so many public mass shooters are suicidal provides hope that some of these horrific crimes can be prevented by focusing specifically on suicide prevention. Although the common perception is that homicides and mass shootings predominate, about two-thirds of the nearly 40,000 gun deaths annually in the United States are suicides. If we as a nation focus on reducing suicides, not only can we save the lives of many of our loved ones, but we may also avert some mass slaughters in the process. Research has shown that the risk a household member will commit suicide is increased threefold when there is a gun in the home. This is not to say that we need to take guns away from law-abiding gun owners who show no signs of being dangerous. However, lives could be saved by a public education campaign (ideally endorsed by gun-rights organizations) recommending that gun owners: 1) temporarily remove a firearm when a household member is in crisis, and 2) safely secure handguns and long guns bought for sport or protection, especially if there is a minor in the home. In cases where a family member is concerned that a gun owner appears suicidal or likely to harm others, Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws (so-called “Red Flag Laws”) give police a tool to remove guns temporarily. Indiana passed the first ERPO law in 2005 following the murder of a police officer. The Indiana law was considered by authorities in the case of an Indianapolis gunman when his mother raised concerns that he was suicidal, but an ERPO order was not sought because he voluntarily relinquished his gun. As a result, the gunman was later able to legally purchase the gun he used in the FedEx shooting. California’s law, which refers to these orders as Gun Violence Restraining Orders (GVRO), has been in effect since 2016. In the San Jose case, the gunman’s ex-wife was reported as saying he was unhappy with his work environment and had threatened to kill his colleagues. Other signs the gunman was dangerous are emerging: He was reportedly detained by the FBI for carrying terrorist documents and NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit reported he was facing a disciplinary hearing for racist comments. Pursuant to California law, a law enforcement officer, a family member, or an employer may file a GVRO petition. Yet apparently no GVRO was sought in this case. Researchers have found that Indiana’s ERPO law reduced suicides by 7.5%. To date, research has focused on suicide prevention, not murder. However, there are a few documented cases where an ERPO was used to remove a gun from someone who was contemplating a mass shooting. Although we will never know for sure, in at least some of these cases, including the case at the San Jose rail yard, removing the gun may have averted a bloodbath. Related Articles

Most Americans agree something must be done to stop the scourge of mass shootings.

309,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/05/29/editorial-on-memorial-day-honor-those-who-died-in-service/,"Trending: Since the founding of America, more than 1 million people have died in service of our country. They came from all walks of life, and regardless of their background, it’s a safe assumption that they hoped, in some way, to make the lives of their loved ones a little better, a little safer, a little freer. On Memorial Day, it’s important to not only honor them but also think about how we can do our part to make our communities and our nation a better place for our families, neighbors and future generations. These are not easy times. The mass shooting in San Jose on Wednesday comes on the heels of a year that has seen massive social and racial unrest, a devastating pandemic and deep political divides that carry the potential to destroy our democracy. But the challenges of today are no less daunting than those faced by previous generations. They met their problems head on and persevered. It’s our job to do the same. Memorial Day was originally known as Decorations Day. The history is sketchy, but the holiday originated in the years following the Civil War. One of the earliest celebrations is believed to have been organized by a group of freed African Americans in Charleston, S.C., after the fall of the Confederacy in 1865. According to David Blight, a Yale University history professor, the Confederate Army used the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club as a prison for Union captives. More than 260 soldiers died at the prison. At the conclusion of the Civil War, one of the first things the freed Black men and women did, Blight said, was to give the Union prisoners a proper burial. Then, on May, 1, 1865, nearly 10,000 freed slaves gathered for a parade to honor those who gave their lives for a cause. History doesn’t record what was said that day, but the experiences of those attending during the war and the uncertainties of the future were even more daunting than those of today. The first formal celebration didn’t occur until May 30, 1868, when Congressman James Garfield helped 5,000 participants decorate the graves of more than 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers who were buried at Arlington Cemetery. It wasn’t until after World War I that Decoration Day became a nationwide day for honoring those who died in all of America’s wars. The tradition of wearing red poppies on the day to symbolize resilience derived from a poem written by Lt. Col. John McCrae to honor the 87,000 allied soldiers who were killed during a battle at Flanders Field in Belgium. Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields. Decoration Day didn’t officially become Memorial Day after after World War II and the Korean War.  In 1968, in the midst of the Vietnam War, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which established Memorial Day as a federal holiday on the last Monday in May. The change formally went into effect in 1971 and was designed to honor all those who died in wars. Most people today think of Memorial Day as the unofficial beginning of summer filled with barbecues, picnics and family gatherings. Those events will be especially poignant for those are are able to safely resume those activities this year. In the midst of those celebrations, take a moment to remember how many have died so that we can enjoy the day with such pleasure and comfort. And let’s also devote time to think about what we can do to serve our communities and our country.

Bill Clinton was president, Kurt Cobain was touring with Nirvana, the first “Jurassic Park” movie had just been released — and people still felt safe going to work. But that summer, a gunman shattered those feelings of security when he opened fire at a law firm in a high-rise office building in San Francisco’s financial district, killing eight people and sending shockwaves through the country. Until this week, when a disgruntled VTA employee killed nine co-workers at a light rail yard in San Jose, it was the deadliest mass shooting in the Bay Area’s history. The 101 California shooting in 1993 marked a turning point in California’s and the nation’s approach to workplace shootings. It had a ripple effect that experts say forever changed how employers and employees think about workplace safety, paved the way for the passage of dozens of laws and helped turn California into the state with the nation’s strictest gun controls. And yet, to those who lived through the 1993 massacre, this week has felt like a horrific déjà vu, making some wonder what all that effort accomplished. Statistics on workplace gun violence suggest we may be better off, but the sense of despair — if anything — has grown. “Here we are, and nothing’s really changed,” said Thomas Kostic, a lawyer who survived the shooting at 101 California St. by barricading himself in a colleague’s office.

California’s strict gun control laws continue to clash with more lenient federal laws, leaving room for shooters potentially to cross state borders, buy guns and ammunition that are illegal in California, and bring them home. In this week’s shooting, Cassidy used three semi-automatic pistols that were legally obtained, but he carried 32 ammunition magazines holding 12 to 15 rounds, which are illegal in California. It was unclear where or how he got the magazines, which California limits to 10 rounds for civilian use.

And it’s a club you don’t want to be a member of.” Impact of the 101 California St. shooting Experts view the 1993 shooting, which left eight people dead in a San Francisco highrise, as a key turning point in California’s and the nation’s gun control debate. — It inspired a federal assault weapons ban that lasted 10 years, until 2004. — Victims of the shooting sued Navegar, the company that made the gun used in the shooting. They lost, but the company went out of business. — Lawyers affected by the shooting founded an organization to fight for gun control, which later became the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

314,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/28/he-led-san-jose-through-catastrophic-floods-a-pandemic-and-a-mass-shooting-now-hes-saying-goodbye/,"Trending: The man who has been at the helm of San Jose for the past four years, leading the city through catastrophic flooding, a global pandemic and now the deadliest mass shooting in city history, is stepping down. On the same day that a gunman opened fire on his coworkers at a VTA rail yard near downtown San Jose, City Manager David Sykes, who has spent more than 34 years working for the city of San Jose, quietly announced that he would be retiring in just two months. His last day will be July 30. “This was not an easy decision, but I feel the time is here,” Sykes wrote to San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and the rest of the city council in an email first reported by San Jose Spotlight. “This last year has been extremely challenging for our City, but I am really proud of the work that we have done together.  Although there are certainly big challenges ahead, I truly believe we have turned the corner on the pandemic as we transition into recovery mode.” In an interview Thursday, Sykes, 56, said that announcing his retirement in the midst of one of the city’s worst tragedies was “not ideal” but it was in motion long before Wednesday morning’s revelation of the shooting. Sykes began his career at the city as a part-time engineering trainee in January 1987. Over the years, he worked his way up from a city engineer to director of public works to assistant city manager and ultimately, to head of the entire city organization. The mayor and council in 2017 unanimously appointed Sykes to city manager without conducting a national search. Liccardo, who in 2017 said that appointing Sykes as city lead was a no-brainer, added this week that Sykes “kept a steady hand on the wheel and guided us through some very challenging trials.” “Dave is genuinely beloved by so many members of our city workforce,” the mayor said. “He has always maintained an authentic commitment to listening and responding thoughtfully to concerns expressed both within City Hall and within the community.” As city manager, Sykes served as the chief administrator, overseeing more than 6,600 city staff, directing department heads, managing the delivery of services and implementing the city council’s priorities and adopted policies. San Jose operates under a council-manager form of government where the elected city council provides policy leadership and appoints a city manager to see those through by managing the organization at-large. That has the potential to change, however, if San Jose adopts a “strong mayor” kind of government, which is under consideration and would give the mayor some of the powers currently held by the city manager. Sykes also led the city’s emergency operations center during trying times, including the devastating 2017 Coyote Creek floods, in which he took responsibility for the city’s delayed evacuation warnings, and most recently, the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, which took the lives of more than 2,000 Santa Clara County residents. “I’ll be honest with you, my job is really demanding — sometimes unrealistically demanding — but you get the opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives every single day and that’s a very rewarding feeling,” Sykes said in an interview. “We’re not perfect and we don’t always do everything right, but by and large we do great work for our community.” Over the course of his four-year stint as city manager, Sykes said he learned from mistakes made during the 2017 floods and considerably improved and invested in the city’s emergency operations center to ensure that San Jose was prepared for the next disaster that came its way. “We really, I think, have done an outstanding job in terms of supporting the needs of our most vulnerable communities during these times and I couldn’t be more proud of the organization and the work that we’ve done, especially during this last year and the pandemic,” he said. Lee Wilcox, who was recently appointed to deputy city manager and previously served as Sykes’ chief of staff, called Sykes an “amazing mentor and leader to everyone in the organization.” “He listens incredibly well and always supports people who are doing really hard work in a way that’s very authentic,” Wilcox said. “He’ll be missed quite a bit.” Sykes will become the latest of a handful of top city officials to leave the organization within the past eight months. The city lost its former police chief Eddie Garcia and deputy city manager Jim Ortbal in December 2020 and former economic development director and deputy city manager Kim Walesh in March. Despite the slew of departures, Sykes said that the city has a “super strong bench.” Carolina Camarena, city spokesperson who worked in Sykes office, echoed the sentiment, saying that he was “leaving the city in a good place to recover from the pandemic and to do so with people in mind.” Sykes was born in the United Kingdom and moved to San Jose as a child. He graduated from Gunderson High School and earned a bachelor’s and master’s degree in civil engineering from San Jose State. Although he’s not yet sure what the next phase of his career will look like, Sykes said he plans to stay in San Jose. “I’m not rushing into anything else,” he said. “I’m looking forward to detaching for a while, taking a break and assessing what I want to do next.” As for those who might be considering a career in the public sphere, Sykes has one piece of advice — do it. “It’s been a very rewarding experience serving our community and I would encourage anyone to come work for city of San Jose,” he said. “It’s hard work, it’s demanding work, but it is a great feeling being able to help people.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2021-05-28 09:40:25,"He led San Jose through catastrophic floods, a pandemic and a mass shooting.

315,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/28/blow-our-collective-violent-ptsd/,"Trending: There was another mass shooting Wednesday, this time leaving nine people dead, just one of the latest mass shootings of the 230-plus this year, according to a tally maintained by The New York Times. As The Times reported, “The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, counted more than 600 such shootings in 2020, compared with 417 in 2019.” We need to recognize the trauma and stress that we as a society have endured because of COVID-19, the collapse of our social structure, the crippling of an economy and the way the racial justice protests have unsettled some people. You add that to an already violent society, one saturated with guns and becoming even more saturated every day, and violence — including mass shootings — is a natural, horrific, inevitable outgrowth. I don’t think we fully understood and appreciated the palliative benefits of congregational opportunities for vulnerable communities, the way they provided outlet and relief, a respite from the pain of oppression and despair. Society needs an outlet valve, particularly at the bottom where the pressure is greatest, but COVID deprived us of that. Gunfire even erupted at George Floyd Square on Tuesday, sending activists and mourners scrambling — people who had gathered to commemorate the one-year anniversary of his murder. The surge of violence in Minneapolis has gotten so bad that the mayor has asked state and federal agencies for assistance because of a police shortage. According to The Star Tribune, nearly 200 officers have left the force in that city after the protests, many citing their own PTSD. But Minneapolis is not alone; violence is surging in cities around the country. Last year, Los Angeles saw its highest level of homicides in a decade, and New York City saw a year-over-year spike from 2019 to 2020 that was larger than any increase since the 1970s, according to Rafael A. Mangual, a senior fellow and the deputy director of legal policy at The Manhattan Institute. And the violence isn’t just shootings. The incivility trickles down. Many of the people we considered essential workers, the ones who kept our society functioning, are the same people on the receiving end of much of the violence. There has been a surge in unruly passengers on airplanes. A Southwest Airlines flight attendant had two teeth knocked out over the weekend when she was attacked by a passenger. New York City bus drivers have seen a surge in violence, and the medical field, already suffering from a pre-COVID surge, has seen even more violence. This is all happening at the same time that we see an extraordinary surge in gun background checks and purchases during the pandemic. As The Washington Post reported in February: “More than 2 million firearms were bought last month, according to The Washington Post’s analysis of federal gun background-check data. That is an 80% year-over-year spike and the third-highest one-month total on record.” Many of the gun buyers are first-time gun buyers. Gun violence and gun sales are part of a self-perpetuating and mutually reinforcing phenomenon, and are only amplified by talk of gun control. As CNN put it in March: “The pattern of rising gun sales following mass shootings has held true regardless of which political party is in power: Fears of future restrictions prompt gun owners to stock up.” Indeed, one of the ironies of the Biden administration is that although the president has urged more gun control and taken some executive actions on the issue, both The Washington Examiner and Forbes have reported that stimulus checks issued while he was in office helped fuel the gun buying surge. As we begin to get back to normal, as some states plan to lift restrictions this summer, schools plan to reopen in the fall and in-office desk jobs begin to beckon stay-at-home workers, we must remember that there is a segment of society that will not so easily shake off the effects of this pandemic. Some parts of our society were already broken. Many of them we broke on purpose. Others, we simply ignored as the injury lingered. The pandemic has compounded the problems, compounded the stress, compounded the trauma. The New Yorker captured the dichotomy our society is experiencing in a headline that read, “The Great Coronavirus Divide: Wall Street Profits Surge as Poverty Rises.” The worn-out idiom was made true: The rich got richer and the poor got poorer. And the poor are in pain. The fragile and vulnerable in society are releasing a roar. Do we hear them? Things are not going to magically snap back to normal, to a normal that was already unacceptable for many. We have to find a way to collectively deal with what happened to our country during this pandemic, something beyond stimulus checks and infrastructure bills. To do that, we have to acknowledge this trauma and work through the soft power of congregation, sharing and listening. This is not a Congress initiative necessarily. This is a kitchen table initiative. This requires neighbor-to-neighbor outreach, communities communing. This requires some dish towel diplomacy: standing in kitchens over a cup of coffee and confessing to how hard this all has been and being seen, truly seen, by the person doing the hearing.

316,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/05/28/8092890-mass-shootings-mental-health-alienation/,"Trending: On Wednesday we saw gun violence once again in the United States, this time in our backyard in San Jose. Another mass shooting. Another murder-suicide. Another senseless tragedy that stole innocent lives and shattered the hearts of families and friends. Just a block or two away from multiple law enforcement agency buildings. Calls for gun control were swift. Stricter gun control measures are absolutely reasonable and necessary, but they are not a panacea, and we should not fool ourselves. Until we are willing to invest significantly in long-term mental health infrastructures and start addressing core issues in people’s sense of alienation, loneliness, bitterness, and hatred, we are only putting a band-aid on the problem. Until we are willing to admit that our intense sense of individualism and factionalism are problematic, we will never be able to lay down our arms and see our neighbors with both truth and grace. Until we are willing to work together and compromise (a dirty word in politics these days), our politics and identities will continue to divide us rather than unite us and move our communities forward into a brighter and safer future. Gun violence is personal to me. When I was 8 years old, my father shot himself to death. He was a special agent for the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS, and he used his service pistol to commit suicide in his company car. One of his last phone calls before pulling the trigger was to his supervisor at the IRS. As an Asian-American federal agent in the late 1990s, he had experienced intense racism and discrimination as he endeavored to climb the corporate ladder. And silently battling his demons with bipolar disorder (largely by himself), he felt like he was at the end of his rope. It took me three years in elementary school to process his death and properly cry and grieve. It took me two decades to understand his pain and his actions — to empathize and not see his suicide as simply selfish. My experiences have taught me that the greatest scars are invisible, that the greatest pain is often inaudible. Yet, our greatest healing can come from those around us — those most visible and present in our lives who are willing to listen and care. Besides bringing life to a standstill, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that everybody is hurting in his or her own way. It ravaged a country that was intensely polarized, communities gasping for truth and justice. And it showed us that we absolutely need each other not only to survive but also to thrive. To borrow a line from James Joyce, it showed us as a community how “(t)o live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life.” Related Articles

As a criminal prosecutor who has practiced in both New York City and Silicon Valley and has too often seen the tragedies of gun violence, I do not see my role as political. Prosecuting gun crimes is not a Republican or a Democratic thing. Keeping guns out of the hands of juveniles, felons, domestic abusers, violent individuals and the mentally ill is an American thing. The pursuit of justice and public safety is neither red nor blue, neither conservative nor liberal. How many more violent incidents will it take before we stop demonizing each other and start recognizing each other’s humanity and dignity? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we realize that each life is short but precious and worth protecting? These are my personal opinions, but perhaps it is time for all of us to start taking this issue personally to find long-term solutions to a complicated problem. Daniel M.

The information could have helped local law enforcement and the suspect's employer potentially mitigate the attack Wednesday that took the lives of nine employees of the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) light rail hub in San Jose, District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in an interview. ""The DA's office was not notified,"" Rosen said, adding he wasn't aware of a single agency in the area that was told this information. ""I would like to have known this in 2016."" Rosen, whose office also helped in the aftermath of the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting two years ago, described the gut-wrenching feeling seeing his community once again suffer through another mass shooting. He detailed a number of potential avenues that local law enforcement and the VTA could have done years ago had federal authorities passed along the information after Samuel Cassidy was detained. The latest in the shooting: San Jose gunman had cans of gasoline, 22K rounds of ammo at home, officials say: What we know 'Such extreme steps': San Jose killer intricately planned rail attack with a simple motive in mind In 2016 — five years before the mass attack — Cassidy was stopped on a trip back from the Philippines by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. A Department of Homeland Security memo from the stop, which was obtained by The Wall Street Journal, includes that an officer found Cassidy had ""books about terrorism and fear and manifestos ... as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA."" The memo doesn't include why Cassidy was stopped. Multiple inquiries to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office and the VTA about their knowledge about Cassidy's 2016 detainment by federal authorities were not returned. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said in a statement the agency was working to improve information being shared with other law enforcement. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Mayorkas, in February, DHS commenced a department-wide review which included efforts to ensure law enforcement personnel have the tools and training to identify behavioral indicators associated with targeted violence and policy to improve information sharing with our partners,"" DHS spokeswoman Sarah Peck said in a statement. Read about the victims: He tried to warn his co-workers, then he was shot: Loved ones mourn victims of shooting at San Jose rail yard Information sharing between agencies has been an issue that has long plagued the law enforcement community but has expanded and increased in recent years, with the federal government implementing a number of programs aimed at increasing communication across jurisdictions. But still, problems persist, including with high-profile incidents from the riot at the U.S. Capitol earlier this year and a tip the FBI got before the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Fla. that was never investigated or passed along to authorities in South Florida. ""There may have been interventions that could have put this individual on a different path,"" Rosen said. ""And when I say interventions, I mean that quite broadly. I mean, mental health interventions, counseling interventions, and as well as law enforcement interventions, in terms of whether the individual had firearms, and so forth."" He detailed California's red-flag laws and his office's work to temporarily remove firearms from individuals who were believed to be a danger to themselves or others, but noted it was unclear when Cassidy obtained his firearms and whether he owned a gun in 2016. Rosen said his office has filed more than 200 of these types of restraining orders over recent years and said it's helped stop ""dozens of these kinds of instances from happening in our county and saved countless lives."" ""If we had had that information, or local law enforcement had had that information, we would have looked into it,"" Rosen said of potentially using the red flag laws on Cassidy. ""And that's just the truth."" But, Rosen said, his office and the law enforcement community in general is far from perfect and even with the early signals, there's no way to know whether this could have been avoided. ""We're not perfect,"" he said. ""I feel like the standard we have to reach is perfection to stop these, and we're human beings doing the very best we can. And you know, there's not a news story written about the dozens of mass shootings that we have averted."" More: After San Jose shooting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asks, 'What the hell is wrong with us?' A timeline of the attack: Officers rushed into San Jose rail yard as gunshots were still ringing out, authorities say Rosen's office took the lead on setting up a family assistance center to help those impacted by the shooting, offering help to the victims, families and those who knew those killed with everything from financial help to counseling. His office is also helping run forensics on the guns and bullets at a crime lab that Rosen jokingly compared to the television show CSI, detailing that his office uploads information about the bullets and firearms into a national database to help find links to other unsolved crimes. Rosen said his office is still processing Cassidy's firearms and the shell casings found at the shooting. He added his office does not know when Cassidy purchased his firearms or where they were obtained. Photos released by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office Friday showed the assortment of weapons and the thousands of rounds Cassidy had in his home. Authorities also found multiple cans of gasoline, suspected Molotov Cocktails, 12 firearms and about 22,000 rounds. Rosen said the back-to-back shootings has been like reliving a nightmare for him, his employees and the community at large. ""It's like you're reliving another nightmare but you're like, 'oh, this isn't the previous nightmare, it's a new nightmare.' And it's layered on top of what happened two years ago,"" he said. ""It's sad and wearying but yet everyone knows we can't give up. Quite the contrary, it's now like, 'Alright, what can we do better and differently to prevent this from happening again.'""

318,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/28/san-jose-shooting-vigil-victims,"Shooting occurred on Wednesday when VTA employee walked into facility and killed nine co-workers Last modified on Fri 28 May 2021 22.50 BST In downtown San Jose, in the crowded plaza of city hall, hundreds of mourning families, local residents and Bay Area light rail employees laid flowers in front of nine framed pictures. It was a scene erected to honor those killed at a rail maintenance yard on Wednesday, the worst mass shooting in the Bay Area’s history.  At a vigil in San Jose on Thursday night, uniformed union members hugged and cried on each other’s shoulders. Some handed out T-shirts emblazoned with the faces of those who were gunned down. A single candle was lit as each name was read by San Jose’s mayor, Sam Liccardo. “We’re here because our colleagues, family members and friends are suffering,” said Liccardo, addressing a gathered crowd of several hundred people. “Healing for many will be a long, difficult path. We’re here to express our commitment to walk with our forlorn family on that long journey.” John Costa, the president of the union that the slain rail workers belonged to, offered words to remember the victims: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. “I want to send a message that we have to honor our brothers today and not forget what happened here,” Costa said. The shooting unfolded on Wednesday when a 57-year-old employee of the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) walked into a facility and opened fire, killing nine of his co-workers. Law enforcement officials have described the gunman, identified as Samuel Cassidy, as a “highly disgruntled” employee, while Cassidy’s ex-wife has spoken of a history of mental health and violent behavior. Costa addressed the need to have honest conversations about mental health and wellness among workers. “We can’t sweep this under the rug. We need to do the right thing and talk about this and recognize this mental illness and worker violence. We can do better than this!” The crowd was peppered with people holding framed photos as silent tears and soft sniffles spread through the sea of mourners. The families of Singh, Delacruz Megia and Romo each spoke to the audience in the city hall plaza, expressing their love for their deceased fathers, sons, and brothers. Delacruz Megia’s father, Leonard Megia, has worked for VTA for 20 years and smiled through teary eyes as he recalled the precious moments that he and his son, who began working for the transit agency full-time in 2012, would wave as they passed each other on their respective routes. “Yesterday was the saddest moment of my life up to now. We really enjoyed seeing each other. I would be on the light rail and he would be on the bus. I’m gonna miss him so much,” Megia said. The 10 deaths, including the gunman, makes San Jose the site of the Bay Area’s most deadly mass shooting, topping a 1993 massacre at a San Francisco-based law firm. It comes as the region, like many others in the country, has seen a surge in gun violence in recent months. This increase has been especially troubling in cities like Oakland that have become national models for successful, community-based gun violence reduction programs. Some of the most recent tragedies include two teenage girls who were shot when the party bus they were riding in was ambushed by a hail of bullets. Two days earlier two 17-year-old boys’ lives were cut short at a park. Following the shooting, Joe Biden ordered the White House flag to be lowered to half-staff to mark the losses of life. Dozens of federal, state and local officials tweeted condolences that have become routine following a high-profile mass shooting in this country. Many of these lamentations also included calls for congressional action on new gun restrictions. But for the colleagues and families of the deceased, any form of healing was far off. Access to mental healthcare was a consistent theme in remarks made by union leadership both as a way to prevent future shootings and as an integral piece of a family’s healing journeys. “Be there, hold each other, love each other, we’re all we’ve got and we’re all we need,” said John Courtney, who leads the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union, and was at the San Jose facility when shots began to ring out. “These aren’t just names to us, they’re people we know and have seen every day of our working lives. This gets down to the core of our souls.”",2021-05-28 09:43:42,"San Jose mourns shooting victims: ‘Healing will be a long, difficult path’","labor,crime and criminals",1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Investigators found the cache of weapons at the home of Samuel James Cassidy, the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office said in a news release. They also turned up multiple cans of gasoline and suspected molotov cocktails. Authorities have said that Cassidy set his house on fire using a timer or slow-burn device to coincide with his attack. The guns he used to open fire on his co-workers appear to be legal, officials said. They have not said how he obtained them.  Investigators were still trying to determine what might have set off Cassidy, who for years apparently held a grudge against his workplace. Cassidy was reportedly due to attend a disciplinary hearing on the day of the attack. NBC Bay Area reported on Thursday night that his scheduled disciplinary hearing followed an investigation by his employer over complaints he made racist remarks to co-workers. Wednesday’s attack was marked by horror and heroism, leaving nine men dead ranging in age from 29 to 63. Taptejdeep Singh, the 36-year-old father of a three-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter, was on an early shift as a light rail operator when the shooting began. He called another transit employee to warn him, saying he needed to get out or hide. “From what I’ve heard, he spent the last moments of his life making sure that others – in the building and elsewhere – would be able to stay safe,” co-worker Sukhvir Singh, who is not related to Taptejdeep Singh, said in a statement. Kirk Bertolet, 64, was just starting his shift when shots rang out, then he heard the screams. He and his co-workers threw a table in front of their door, and Bertolet called the control center. Then there was silence. Cautiously, Bertolet left the barricaded office, hoping he could offer first aid. He couldn’t. He saw some of his co-workers take their last breaths. Bertolet, a signal maintenance worker who worked in a separate unit from Cassidy, said he is convinced Cassidy targeted his victims, because he didn’t hurt some people he encountered. “He was pissed off at certain people. He was angry, and he took his vengeance out on very specific people. He shot people. He let others live,” he said. Cassidy fired 39 bullets. Camera footage showed him calmly walking from one building to another with his duffel bag to complete the slaughter, authorities said. “It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there: ‘I’m not going to shoot you,”’ said Laurie Smith, the Santa Clara county sheriff. “And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot.” Cassidy’s ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. Cecilia Nelms told the Associated Press that he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. He also spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines, a Biden administration official told the AP. A Department of Homeland Security memo said Cassidy also had notes on how he hated the Valley Transportation Authority, according to the official. It doesn’t say why he was stopped by customs officers. It said he had books about “terrorism and fear and manifestos” but when he was asked whether he had issues with people at work, he said no. The memo notes that Cassidy had a “minor criminal history,” citing a 1983 arrest in San Jose and charges of “misdemeanor obstruction/resisting a peace officer.” San Jose police said in a statement through Mayor Sam Liccardo’s office that they sought an FBI history on Cassidy and found no record of federal arrests or convictions. “Whatever this detention at the border was, it did not result in an arrest that showed up on his FBI criminal history, and it was not reported to SJPD,” the statement said. Neighbors, acquaintances and an ex-girlfriend described him as a loner, unfriendly and prone at times to fits of anger. Documents show he had worked at the transit authority since at least 2012. Bertolet described Cassidy as anoutsider. “He was never in the group. He was never accepted by anybody there. He was always that guy that was never partaking in anything that the people were doing,” Bertolet said.",2021-05-28 19:38:34,"San Jose gunman stockpiled weapons and 22,000 rounds of ammunition",murders and attempted murders,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

00:45 A gunman who killed nine of his co-workers at a rail yard in San Jose, California, had stockpiled weapons and ammunition at his home, including 12 guns and 22,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said on Friday.Investigators found the cache of weapons at the home of Samuel James Cassidy, the Santa Clara county sheriff’s office said in a news release. They also turned up multiple cans of gasoline and suspected molotov cocktails. Authorities have said that Cassidy set his house on fire using a timer or slow-burn device to coincide with his attack. The guns he used to open fire on his co-workers appear to be legal, officials said. They have not said how he obtained them. The nine victims in the worst mass shooting in the region have been identified as: Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, Lars Kepler Lane, 63; and Alex Ward Fritch, 49. 12.32am BST
00:32 The US Post Office announced today that it is increasing the price of a first-class postage stamp – from 55 cents to 58 cents – in an effort to offset declining revenues, Reuters reports. Mail volume has decreased 28% in the last ten years, USPS said in a statement. The rates for international letters and postcards will also increase later this summer. The postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, is working to erase $160bn in projected liabilities over the next decade.

00:09 Joe Biden’s proposed 2022 budget removes a ban on federal funding for most abortions that has been included in government spending bills for decades, Reuters reports. The budget, released today, omits any mention of the Hyde amendment, which was first passed in 1976, and has been included in spending bills since. That change, however, is not likely to get through the Senate: BREAKING: Biden's budget drops the Hyde amendment, the decades-old ban on federal funding for abortion that he pledged to get rid of on the campaign trail. But the change is unlikely to survive the 50-50 Senate. https://t.co/XcGW6MXLeQ The longstanding amendment restricts abortion coverage for recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, federal employees, service members and Washington DC residents. It could still be added to a later spending bill. Advocates celebrated: Exciting to see the admin’s historic step! For too long, the Hyde amendment has put the gov't in control of personal health care decisions for people with low incomes. Your ZIP code, income, or health insurance should never determine the care you can access, incl. abortion. https://t.co/CCCUAft8Wd The move comes at a time when the anti-abortion movement in the US is emboldened and looking forward to a supreme court case directly challenging the laws underpinning the right to abortion in the US.

23:23 The Biden administration is working to “dramatically reshape” the way asylum seekers are processed, in an effort to prevent a growing backlog of immigration court cases, BuzzFeed News reported, citing government documents. SCOOP: The Biden administration is planning to dramatically reshape how asylum-seekers are processed in order to prevent an increase to the backlog of immigration court cases, according to government docs BuzzFeed News obtained.https://t.co/X9AOKEepWD The changes could cut the waiting period by years for some applicants, according to reporter Hamed Aleaziz. The new policy, which is not finalized yet, would give asylum officers the power to decide cases instead of immigration judges in certain instances. Depending on how it is implemented, the plan could represent President Joe Biden’s most consequential immigration policy to date and fundamentally change the dynamics at the southern border by preventing asylum cases from taking years to complete in court. The Trump administration overhauled the asylum process in significant ways, creating more obstacles for migrants seeking protection in the US. From the draft Biden policy cited in the report: If there is any area of agreement on immigration, it is that the system for dealing with asylum claims at the border is ‘overwhelmed’ and in desperate need of repair. A system that takes years to get to a result is not a working system. It is unfair to those who need protection, and it encourages abuse by those undeserving of protection and the smugglers who exploit dysfunction for profit. The aim of this rule is to begin urgently replacing a broken system with a more efficient one, adjudicating asylum claims expeditiously without [compromising] fairness.” 10.52pm BST

22:33 A federal judge is appointing a “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege during a review of materials seized from Rudy Giuliani and another attorney who has represented Donald Trump, the AP reports: The judge rejected efforts by Giuliani and lawyer Victoria Toensing to force prosecutors to divulge more about why they seized electronic devices on 28 April. Prosecutors made the unusual request for the appointment of a lawyer or “special master” to protect attorney-client privilege the day after the raids, citing the need to make it clear that materials were reviewed appropriately. Prosecutors are examining Giuliani’s interactions with Ukrainian figures and whether he violated a law governing lobbying on behalf of foreign countries or entities. Prosecutors later revealed that the FBI had successfully downloaded 11 devices belonging to Giuliani and returned them to him. 10.25pm BST
22:25 My colleague Abené Clayton spent time in San Jose yesterday where families were mourning the sudden losses of their loved ones in the Bay Area’s worst mass shooting. The shooting unfolded on Wednesday when a 57-year-old employee of the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) walked into a facility and opened fire, killing nine of his co-workers. In Downtown San Jose, hundreds of people, including dozens of @VTA employees have gathered for a vigil in honor of their colleagues who were slain yesterday.

22:14 Hi all - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, continuing our live coverage for the rest of the day. The mother of Brian Sicknick, the Capitol police officer who died after the 6 January insurrection, has spoken out about Senate Republicans blocking the creation of a special commission to study the attack. “I don’t understand it. They are elected for us, the people, and they don’t care about that,” Gladys Sicknick told CNN after meeting with GOP senators on Thursday. “They care about money, I guess, their pocketbooks. So they’ll be in front of the cameras when they feel like it. They just don’t care, and it’s not right.” Her son was sprayed with a chemical during the insurrection, collapsed and later suffered a stroke. “I think you know it’s all talk and no action. Clearly, they’re not backing the blue,” Sandra Garza, the late officer’s girlfriend, told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “It’s just unbelievable to me that they could do nothing about this.” An honor to have on @TheLeadCNN today Sandra Garza, the partner of the late Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, and Gladys Sicknick, his mother. They’re in DC to lobby for the bipartisan Jan 6 Commission that the Senate GOP just blocked. pic.twitter.com/cBEWTyhgj8 Republicans killed the effort to set up a 9/11-style inquiry into the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob despite broad popular support for such an investigation and pleas from the family of a Capitol police officer who collapsed and died after the siege and other officers who battled the rioters. 10.00pm BST

21:42 David Smith The question now is not so much whether the Republican party can be saved any time in the foreseeable future. It is what Joe Biden and the Democrats should do when faced with a party determined to subvert democracy through any means necessary, including violence. On Friday Republicans in the Senate torpedoed an effort to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the deadly insurrection by Donald Trump’s supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January, deploying the procedural move known as the filibuster to stop it even being debated. Fearful perhaps of what such a commission might uncover about their own role as co-conspirators, most brushed aside personal pleas by Gladys Sicknick, the mother of a police officer who was that day sprayed with a chemical, collapsed and later had a stroke and died. “A country that cannot even agree to investigate an assault on its Capitol is in big trouble, indeed,” observed Susan Glasser in the New Yorker magazine. 9.21pm BST
21:21 Joe Biden has released a statement condemning the recent rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country. “These attacks are despicable, unconscionable, un-American, and they must stop,” the president said. “I will not allow our fellow Americans to be intimidated or attacked because of who they are or the faith they practice. “We cannot allow the toxic combination of hatred, dangerous lies, and conspiracy theories to put our fellow Americans at risk.” Biden noted that attorney general Merrick Garland has pledged to deploy all tools available to the justice department to combat hate crimes. “We must all stand together to silence these terrible and terrifying echoes of the worst chapters in world history, and pledge to give hate no safe harbor,” the president said. “Let us all take up that work and create a nation that stands for, and stands up for, the dignity and safety of all of our people.” According to the Anti-Defamation League, reports of anti-Semitic hate incidents increased by 75% during the two weeks of military conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Over those two weeks, 222 hate incidents were reported, compared to 127 for the two-week period before that. “Many of these incidents appear to have been perpetrated by individuals scapegoating American Jews for the actions of the Israeli government,” the ADL said. 9.03pm BST
21:03 Meanwhile, congressional Republicans criticized Joe Biden’s $6 trillion as a wasteful spending spree that would do little to improve Americans’ lives. “President Biden’s proposal would drown American families in debt, deficits, and inflation,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.

(Biden has called for spending $1.7 trillion above the baseline level on infrastructure.) “If Washington Democrats can move beyond the socialist daydreams and the go-it-alone partisanship, we could get a lot of important work done for our country,” McConnell said. 8.46pm BST
20:46 House speaker Nancy Pelosi praised Joe Biden’s newly announced budget as “an unequivocal declaration of the value that Democrats place on America’s workers and middle class families”. A federal budget should be a statement of our national values. @POTUS Biden’s budget is an unequivocal declaration of the value that Democrats place on America’s workers and middle class families, who are the foundation of our nation’s strength and the key to #BuildBackBetter. “The Biden budget makes historic investments in the American workforce and economy. It does so by seizing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create millions of good-paying Americans jobs, supercharge America’s global competitiveness and power growth for generations to come,” the Democratic speaker said in a statement. “Congressional Democrats look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to enact this visionary budget, which will pave the path to opportunity and prosperity for our nation.” The release of Biden’s budget comes as the White House continues to negotiate with Senate Republicans over an infrastructure bill, with the hope that the final proposal can attract bipartisan support in Congress. 8.25pm BST

20:11 The Guardian’s Dominic Rushe has the latest on Biden’s $6tn budget proposal Friday: Biden’s budget would fund a dramatic overhaul of US infrastructure, and dedicate extensive funds to education and climate action—which would put government spending at its “highest sustained levels since the second world war,” Rushe explains. Importantly, Rushe points out, Biden’s first budget is “largely a political document.” While this proposal makes clear Biden’s hopes for revitalizing the US in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans are already chaffing against its scale. Indeed, no Republicans voted in favor of Biden’s $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill. Biden has also been forced to limit his infrastructure bill to $1.7tn, down from his originally proposed $2.2tn initiative. So, the chances of getting GOP support for such a budget are slim. Biden’s two-part initiative to revitalize the US economy is rooted in ramping up its flagging infrastructure and broadening its social safety net. These initiatives would cause the US to have yearly deficits of more than $1.3tn over the next 10 years, with debt increasing to 117% of the value of economic output before 2031. Biden’s plan would be funded, in part, by increasing taxes on corporations and the extremely wealthy. He supports increasing corporate taxes to 28%, up from 21%. All Republicans oppose this tax increase plan, as do some Democrats. Updated

19:49 Victoria Bekiempis Joe Manchin has slammed GOP senators who blocked the creation of a bipartisan commission to study the deadly Capitol insurrection on 6 January. “Choosing to put politics and political elections above the health of our Democracy is unconscionable, and the betrayal of the oath we each take is something they will have to live with,” Manchin, a Democrat senator from West Virginia, has said.

Manchin tells viewers that Democratic leadership in the house and Senate accepted Republicans’ proposed changes “because a commission of this nature must be bipartisan to be successful.” He recognizes the “six brave Republicans” who favored establishing the commission, while pointing out that four more were needed to advance this legislation. Manchin, in his address, has also issued a broad apology about the commission’s failure to progress. “You deserve better, and I am sorry that my Republican colleagues and friends, let political fear prevent them from doing what they know in their hearts to be right.” Updated

323,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/us/migrant-children-legal-rights.html,"Advertisement Supported by California today Friday: Immigration lawyers and groups have been visiting emergency shelters to help educate children who crossed the border without a parent. By Miriam Jordan Good morning. Every Tuesday and Friday, Lindsay Toczylowski visits the Long Beach Convention Center, where she gathers small groups of children, some as young as 6, for a 45-minute lesson. She’s not there to teach the ABCs. She’s there to educate them about their legal rights. Toczylowski is an immigration lawyer. Her students are migrants who crossed the southwestern border without a parent. Since April, the convention center has been housing children, many of them Central Americans who fled violence and poverty. Transferred there from Border Patrol custody, they remain in Long Beach until their potential guardians, typically family members, submit the paperwork required by the federal government to prove that they are related and that the children will be safe. During their stay at emergency shelters in Southern California, which can stretch days or weeks, the children participate in music, art and other activities. The goal of Toczylowski’s nonprofit legal-aid group, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, is to educate rather than entertain them. “We want to make sure they know that they are not alone in their legal process,” said Toczylowski, who is the executive director of Immigrant Defenders and who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with “No immigrants stand alone” in Spanish. Each day, a team of lawyers and paralegals from the nonprofit group visits the convention center and the Pomona Fairplex, another temporary shelter for migrant children, to conduct “know your rights” presentations. Having entered the country without permission, the children are in deportation proceedings. But if they follow the right steps, they could win the right to remain in the United States. The lawyers aim to deliver that message with a lively PowerPoint. One slide depicts a courtroom with cartoon figures of a judge, lawyers and a clerk. Then a child pops up on the screen. “That is you, I tell the kids, and you are the most important person in the immigration courtroom,” Toczylowski said. “This is your chance to tell your story — why you came to the U.S. and what you are hoping for.” The children learn they have the right to a court interpreter, and they are advised to have a lawyer by their side. Immigrant Defenders helps connect them with lawyers. Attending every court date, the children are told, gives them the best shot at winning asylum or a visa that would put them on the path to permanent U.S. residency. But if they miss a hearing, a judge can order their deportation in absentia. “We drive home that point by asking them what happens if one team doesn’t show up for a soccer game: It loses,” she said. “In court, showing up for your hearings doesn’t guarantee you win. But if you don’t show up, you will automatically lose, like the soccer team.” The team has briefed hundreds of children, including those quarantined because they tested positive for the coronavirus upon arrival at the convention center. To ensure that sponsors of the children are also aware of the legal process, Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project, a nonprofit group affiliated with Catholic Charities of Los Angeles, has been training the case managers who handle the minors’ reunification with the adults receiving them. “We are going to have thousands of kids with immigration cases going on for years,” said Kimberley Plotnik, program director at Esperanza. “It’s not over once they leave the shelters.” Most of the children know they are in Long Beach, and some even tell Toczylowski that the city would be called “playa larga” in Spanish. They tell her that they prefer being at the convention center rather than a border facility, where they sleep on the ground, with only a wafer-thin sheet to cover them. The food is much better, too, they report. Toczylowski often shares with the migrants that she has children their age, Maya, 11 and Santiago, 6. As Mother’s Day approached, she couldn’t stop thinking about a little girl she had met. The 7-year-old child from Central America had been carrying a cellphone, where she had her mother’s contact information stored as she traveled north. Agents who processed her after she was intercepted at the border kept the device, and she had not memorized the number. Toczylowski recalled her sharing the only thing she knew: “My mommy lives where it snows.” Later, the little girl’s eyes filled with tears, and she asked, “Will I get adopted? Will I stay here forever?” About 10 days later, she was reunited with her mother in the Midwest. Compiled by Jonathan Wolfe The authorities said they were still seeking the motive of a gunman who shot and killed nine co-workers at a rail yard in San Jose. The gunman had semiautomatic handguns and nearly three dozen high-capacity magazines. In 2016, he was stopped by border officials, who searched his bags and found writings about how he hated his workplace. Here’s what we know about the victims. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as one with four or more people injured or killed, not including the perpetrator, has counted at least 232 mass shootings so far this year.

324,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/29/us/gun-purchases-ownership-pandemic.html,"Advertisement Supported by Preliminary research data show that about a fifth of all Americans who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners. Sales usually spike around elections, but the sheer volume is notable. By Sabrina Tavernise WASHINGTON — It was another week with another horrific mass shooting. In cities across the country, gun homicides were climbing. Democrats and Republicans argued over the causes. President Biden said enough. But beneath the timeworn political cycle on guns in the United States, the country’s appetite for firearms has only been increasing, with more being bought by more Americans than ever before. While gun sales have been climbing for decades — they often spike in election years and after high-profile crimes — Americans have been on an unusual, prolonged buying spree fueled by the coronavirus pandemic, the protests last summer and the fears they both stoked. In March last year, federal background checks, a rough proxy for purchases, topped one million in a week for the first time since the government began tracking them in 1998. And the buying continued, through the protests in the summer and the election in the fall, until a week this spring broke the record with 1.2 million background checks. “There was a surge in purchasing unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, a gun researcher at the University of California, Davis. “Usually it slows down. But this just kept going.” Not only were people who already had guns buying more, but people who had never owned one were buying them too. New preliminary data from Northeastern University and the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show that about a fifth of all Americans who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners. And the data, which has not been previously released, showed that new owners were less likely than usual to be male and white. Half were women, a fifth were Black and a fifth were Hispanic. In all, the data found that 39 percent of American households own guns. That is up from 32 percent in 2016, according to the General Social Survey, a public opinion poll conducted by a research center at the University of Chicago. Researchers said it was too early to tell whether the uptick represents a reversal from the past 20 years, in which ownership was basically flat. “Americans are in an arms race with themselves,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who represents South Los Angeles, where the surge in gun violence has been particularly sharp, on the City Council. “There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic.” Now the gun debate is, once again, taking center stage, this time at a moment of hardening political division and deepening distrust. Sales usually spike around elections, but the sheer volume this time is notable. It also gives a worrying glimpse into the way Americans view one another — as people they want to protect themselves from. As the country’s major political parties move further apart, so does the legislation that flows from them — and like voting rights and abortion, guns are no exception. This month, Texas became the 20th state to pass legislation that says a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun, according to Anne S. Teigen, an expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Illinois and the city of San Jose, Calif., where nine people were killed in a mass shooting this past week, are considering bills that would tax things like ammunition, and certain types of guns. There is no single reason for the surge, but social scientists point to many potential drivers. “There is a breakdown in trust and a breakdown in a shared, common reality,” said Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland who writes about political violence. “There is also all this social change, and social change is scary.” Many gun store workers reported that last year set records for sales and also that they noticed different types of buyers walking in the door. Thomas Harris, a former law enforcement officer who works at the gun counter at Sportsman’s Warehouse in Roanoke, Va., said that around March last year, the customers he would speak with began to include more white-collar workers, such as people from insurance firms and software companies. He said many of the buyers were not conservative and most had never handled a gun. “Outside of seeing something on TV or in a movie, they knew nothing about them,” he said, adding that they did not know how to load a gun or what a caliber was. He said many of these apparent first-time buyers purchased more expensive guns, in the range of $400 or more. The purpose, he said, was not to carry the gun around in public, but to keep it at home. “They were saying: ‘We’re going to be locking down. We’re constrained to our homes. We want to keep safe.’” The Northeastern and Harvard data come from a survey of 19,000 people conducted in April. Researchers found that about 6.5 percent of American adults bought guns in 2020, or about 17 million people. That was up from 5.3 percent in 2019, said Dr. Matthew Miller, a professor of epidemiology at Northeastern, who conducted the study with Deborah Azrael, a researcher at Harvard. While about a fifth of gun buyers last year were first-time buyers, the share was about the same in 2019, he said, suggesting that the trend did not start with the pandemic. As for gun owners overall in 2021, he said, 63 percent were male, 73 percent were white, 10 percent were Black and 12 percent were Hispanic. The pandemic accelerated a trend of rising gun sales. According to The Trace, a news outlet that tracks gun sales, purchases have been rising steadily over the past decade, with a jump around the beginning of 2013, after the Sandy Hook shooting. Sales did not change much under former President Donald J. Trump, but they exploded in 2020, up by 64 percent from the previous year. The single highest month last year was in June, as protests swept across the country after the murder of George Floyd. The pace has continued this year: Americans bought more than 2.3 million guns in January, the highest since last July, according to The Trace. And overall in the first quarter, sales jumped 18 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2020, according to The Trace. Daniel Nass, data and graphics editor at the organization, said that the raw numbers from the federal background check database include things like checks for concealed carry permits, and that The Trace adjusts the numbers to strip that out. The government does not track the number of guns sold in the United States. Even the federal background check data do not give a complete picture, as many sales are private. Estimates of the total number of guns in circulation range as high as 400 million. But while research has shown that higher gun prevalence is associated with a higher rate of gun deaths — including suicide — the question of whether a sudden surge in gun sales prompts a corresponding rise in gun violence does not have a clear answer. Dr. Wintemute, of the University of California, said he recently tried to find out. He analyzed federal background check data from January 2018 through the first months of the pandemic. His research showed that more violence happened in states where gun purchases were up the most — but that many factors were at play, including lockdowns and job loss, and that it was not clear that gun sales in particular were the driver. Nevertheless, he said, the buying surge was worrying, given just how sharp the rise in homicides was last year, up by a quarter, according to data from the F.B.I. An overwhelming majority of homicides in the United States are from guns. The jump has continued this year, up by about 18 percent in a sample of 37 cities in the first three months, compared to the same period last year. Historically, however, the rate is still far below the ones from the 1990s. “We have just turned the corner into some really awful territory,” he said. Homicides in Los Angeles rose 36 percent last year, and the city is seeing no let up in gun violence. Through mid-May, the number of shooting victims was up 68 percent, while the number of reported shots fired was up 56 percent. Chief Michel Moore of the Los Angeles Police Department said it had recovered more than 3,000 guns through the end of April. He said that on average, officers in Los Angeles are recovering 25 guns per day, and that gun arrests are up by 60 percent this year. “The number of guns out there is just astonishing,” Chief Moore said. In the most recent mass shooting, two people were killed and at least 20 people injured in a shooting outside a banquet hall in Hialeah, Fla., early on Sunday, officials said. The police said three people arrived in a white Nissan Pathfinder, exited the vehicle and began firing into a crowd of people outside the hall. Gun control advocates argue that more weapons in circulation means more Americans dying from guns, and that stronger regulations and gun buybacks would save lives. Gun rights advocates say restrictions end up obstructing law-abiding citizens and argue for more policing instead. Many Americans have expressed a hopelessness that the country will ever get a handle on the violence. “There’s this fatalism,” said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, an epidemiologist who helped establish the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We’re so stuck,” he said, describing the thinking. “We have so many guns.” But Dr. Rosenberg and many epidemiologists pushed back on that thinking, saying there are interventions that reduce gun violence while also protecting gun rights. In California, whose gun laws are some of the strongest in the country, the per capita gun death rate has actually gone down over the years. Violent gun death rates in the state dropped by about half from 1989 to 2019, said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, compared to a 13 percent drop for the nation. Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University, said laws were often less effective than gun control advocates say. He said controls that targeted high-risk individuals, like mentally ill people, seemed to work better than those that sought to prevent young people from buying guns. Mass shootings, he said, were the least likely type of violence that laws would be effective against. “Mass shooters in many cases are willing to die, working on a plan for weeks and months,” he said. “That’s the last person a law is going to stop. Gun control works with more casually motivated violence.” Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, said the focus on the sheer number of guns was misplaced. “The critical issue is not simply the increase in the supply of guns but in the nature of the weaponry that’s being used in violent crime, and that has really changed,” he said. Police departments across the country are reporting seizures of more powerful automatic or semiautomatic-style guns with larger magazines, he said, weapons that have a much higher probability of killing because of how quickly the rounds can be fired. He said it is not uncommon for dozens of casings to be found at a crime scene. Tim Arango and Shawn Hubler contributed reporting.

326,https://www.startribune.com/gun-buying-spiked-during-the-pandemic-and-its-still-up/600062694/,"WASHINGTON — It was another week with another horrific mass shooting. In cities across the country, gun homicides were climbing. Democrats and Republicans argued over the causes. President Joe Biden said enough. But beneath the timeworn political cycle on guns in the United States, the country's appetite for firearms has only been increasing, with more being bought by more Americans than ever before. While gun sales have been climbing for decades — they often spike in election years and after high-profile crimes — Americans have been on an unusual, prolonged buying spree fueled by the coronavirus pandemic, the protests last summer and the fears they both stoked. In March 2020, federal background checks, a rough proxy for purchases, topped 1 million in a week for the first time since the government began tracking them in 1998. And the buying continued, through the protests in the summer and the election in the fall, until a week this spring broke the record with 1.2 million background checks. ""There was a surge in purchasing unlike anything we've ever seen,"" said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, a gun researcher at the University of California, Davis. ""Usually it slows down. But this just kept going."" Not only were people who had guns buying more, but people who had never owned one were buying them too. New preliminary data from Northeastern University and the Harvard Injury Control Research Center show that about one-fifth of all Americans who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners. And the data, which has not been previously released, showed that new owners were less likely than usual to be male and white. Half were women, one-fifth were Black and one-fifth were Hispanic. In all, the data found that 39% of U.S. households own guns. That is up from 32% in 2016, according to the General Social Survey, a public opinion poll conducted by a research center at the University of Chicago. Researchers said it was too early to tell whether the uptick represents a reversal from the past 20 years, in which ownership was basically flat. ""Americans are in an arms race with themselves,"" said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who represents South Los Angeles, where the surge in gun violence has been particularly sharp, on the City Council. ""There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic."" Now the gun debate is once again taking center stage, this time at a moment of hardening political division and deepening distrust. Sales usually spike around elections, but the sheer volume this time is notable. It also gives a worrying glimpse into the way that Americans view one another — as people they want to protect themselves from. As the country's major political parties move further apart, so does the legislation that flows from them — and like voting rights and abortion, guns are no exception. This month, Texas became the 20th state to pass legislation that says a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun, according to Anne S. Teigen, an expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Illinois and the city of San Jose, California, where nine people were killed in a mass shooting this past week, are considering bills that would tax things like ammunition and certain types of guns. There is no single reason for the surge, but social scientists point to many potential drivers. ""There is a breakdown in trust and a breakdown in a shared, common reality,"" said Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland who writes about political violence. ""There is also all this social change, and social change is scary."" Many gun store workers reported that last year set records for sales and also that they noticed different types of buyers walking in the door. Thomas Harris, a former law enforcement officer who works at the gun counter at Sportsman's Warehouse in Roanoke, Virginia, said that around March 2020, the customers he would speak with began to include more white-collar workers, such as people from insurance firms and software companies. He said many of the buyers were not conservative, and most had never handled a gun. ""Outside of seeing something on TV or in a movie, they knew nothing about them,"" he said, adding that they did not know how to load a gun or what a caliber was. He said many of these apparent first-time buyers purchased more expensive guns, in the range of $400 or more. The purpose, he said, was not to carry the gun around in public but to keep it at home. ""They were saying, 'We're going to be locking down. We're constrained to our homes. We want to keep safe.'"" The Northeastern and Harvard data come from a survey of 19,000 people conducted in April. Researchers found that about 6.5% of U.S. adults bought guns in 2020, or about 17 million people. That was up from 5.3% in 2019, said Dr. Matthew Miller, a professor of public health research at Northeastern, who conducted the study with Deborah Azrael, a researcher at Harvard. While about one-fifth of gun buyers last year were first-time buyers, the share was about the same in 2019, he said, suggesting that the trend did not start with the pandemic. As for gun owners overall in 2021, he said, 63% were male, 73% were white, 10% were Black and 12% were Hispanic. The pandemic accelerated a trend of rising gun sales. According to The Trace, a news outlet that tracks gun sales, purchases have been rising steadily over the past decade, with a jump around the beginning of 2013, after the Sandy Hook shooting. Sales did not change much under former President Donald Trump, but they exploded in 2020, up by 64% from the previous year. The single highest month last year was in June as protests swept across the country after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The pace has continued this year: Americans bought more than 2.3 million guns in January, the highest since July, according to The Trace. And overall in the first quarter, sales jumped 18%, compared to the first quarter of 2020, according to The Trace. Daniel Nass, data and graphics editor at the organization, said that the raw numbers from the federal background check database include things like checks for concealed carry permits and that The Trace adjusts the numbers to strip that out. The government does not track the number of guns sold in the United States. Even the federal background check data do not give a complete picture, as many sales are private. Estimates of the total number of guns in circulation range as high as 400 million. But while research has shown that higher gun prevalence is associated with a higher rate of gun deaths — including suicide — the question of whether a sudden surge in gun sales prompts a corresponding rise in gun violence does not have a clear answer. Wintemute, of the University of California, said he recently tried to find out. He analyzed federal background check data from January 2018 through the first months of the pandemic.

328,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2021/may/28/victims-targeted-sheriff-suspects/,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A gunman who killed nine people at a California rail yard where he worked appeared to target some of the victims, a sheriff told The Associated Press on Thursday, while a Biden administration official said the shooter spoke of hating his workplace when customs officers detained him after a 2016 trip to the Philippines. Samuel Cassidy, 57, arrived at the light rail facility for the Valley Transportation Authority in San Jose about 6 a.m. Wednesday with a duffel bag filled with semi-automatic handguns and high-capacity magazines, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said. ""It appears to us at this point that he said to one of the people there: 'I'm not going to shoot you,'"" Smith said. ""And then he shot other people. So I imagine there was some kind of thought on who he wanted to shoot."" While there are no cameras inside the rail yard's two buildings, Smith said footage captured him moving from one location to the next. It took deputies six minutes from the first 911 calls to find Cassidy on the third floor of one of the buildings, Smith said. [Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-qi8L1iNCY] He killed himself as deputies closed in on the facility serving the county of more than 1 million people in the heart of Silicon Valley. More than 100 people were there at the time, and authorities found five victims in one building and two in another, Smith said. Authorities do not yet know whether Cassidy had worked regularly with any of the victims. Investigators were serving search warrants for his home and cellphone, seeking to determine what prompted the bloodshed, the sheriff said. After being detained in 2016, Cassidy was found to have a memo book with notes on how he hated the Valley Transportation Authority, according to a Biden administration official who described a Department of Homeland Security memo laying out Cassidy's statements. The official saw the memo and detailed its contents to The Associated Press but was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The Wall Street Journal first reported the memo. The memo doesn't say why he was stopped by customs officers. It said he had books about ""terrorism and fear and manifestos,"" but when he was asked whether he had issues with people at work, he said no. It notes that Cassidy had a ""minor criminal history."" Cassidy's ex-wife said he had talked about killing people at work more than a decade ago. Documents show he had worked at the transit authority since at least 2012. ""I never believed him, and it never happened. Until now,"" a tearful Cecilia Nelms said Wednesday. She said he used to come home from work resentful and angry over what he perceived as unfair assignments. ""He could dwell on things,"" she said. The two were married for about 10 years until 2005, and she had not been in touch with Cassidy for about 13 years, Nelms said. The three 9mm handguns he had appear to be legal, sheriff's officials said. Authorities do not yet know how he obtained them. He also had 11 high-capacity magazines, each with 12 rounds. In California, it is illegal to buy magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. However, if Cassidy obtained them before Jan. 1, 2000, he would have been allowed to have them unless he was otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms. The sheriff said authorities found explosives at the gunman's home, where investigators believe he had set a timer or slow-burn device so that a fire would occur at the same time as the shooting. Flames were reported minutes after the first 911 calls came in from the rail facility. The attack was the 15th mass killing in the U.S. this year. All were shootings that claimed at least four lives each for a total of 87 deaths, according to a database compiled by the AP, USA Today and Northeastern University. The rail yard victims were Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Taptejdeep Singh, 36; Adrian Balleza, 29; Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; and Lars Kepler Lane, 63.

331,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/dIM9SwVwyB0/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) responded to Wednesday’s San Jose firearm-based attack by claiming that California gun control still works. Newsome tweeted: “Some people (…meaning the GOP and NRA) like to point to horrific shootings like yesterday’s and say CA’s strict gun laws don’t work. The reality is that is simply not true.” He then went back to 1933 and focused on the “rate” of gun deaths instead of the number of gun deaths. Newsom wrote, “CA has the 7th lowest gun death rate in the nation.” Pointing to the “death rate” allowed Newsom to bypass mentioning that California gun control has not stopped the state from witnessing mass shooting after mass shooting during the last decade. For example: Moreover, following the San Jose shooting the Los Angeles Times noted that there were 11 workplace shootings in California between 1986 and 2011. California has an “assault weapons” ban, universal background checks, a red flag law, a 10-day waiting period on gun sales, a limit on the number of guns a law-abiding citizen can purchase in a month, a “good cause” requirement for concealed carry permit issuance, and numerous other guns controls, as well as controls on ammunition sales.

332,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-truly-sinister-message-behind-the-rights-defense-of-its-lies?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH Conservatives seem happy to lie about everything from election fraud to Sandy Hook, until it’s time to go to court. Earlier this month, a lawyer for the busted Capitol rioter Anthony Antonio offered a remarkable defense for his client: It was Fox News’ fault. After losing his job during the pandemic, his lawyer argued, Antonio spent the next six months watching Fox News “constantly.” In doing so, he developed ""Foxitus,” which caused him to believe Donald Trump's “stop the steal” lies and then storm the Capitol. While this defense has garnered loads of media attention for its novelty, a much more cynical courtroom defense involving Fox News and right-wing punditry has been largely overlooked. That defense, dubbed the “No Reasonable Person” defense, has been made by a string of prominent conservatives, including Sidney Powell, Alex Jones, and Tucker Carlson. It argues that “no reasonable person” would believe the statements they make, which ostensibly gives them the right to say whatever they want—no matter how reckless or untrue. The “No Reasonable Person” defense is significant because it shows that conservative media stars and their networks, and even prominent conservative lawyers, are finally admitting that they are not reliable sources of facts: They are opportunists and entertainers, first and foremost. Take Sidney Powell, Donald Trump’s former lawyer. In March, Powell sought to dismiss a $1.3 billion defamation suit filed against her by Dominion Voting Systems. Her lawyers argued that “No reasonable person would conclude that the statements [Powell made] were truly statements of fact.” The “statements” the motion referred to were Powell’s claims that Dominion engaged in a widespread conspiracy to rig the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden—by, among other things, electronically switching votes cast for Trump to Biden. Those statements were repeated constantly by Fox News and other right-wing outlets, doing untold damage to our democracy by helping entrench the fallacy that the election was stolen (polls show most Republicans still believe this). As Orwellian as Powell’s defense sounds—she is a lawyer, after all—it was just the latest attempt by a prominent conservative to use this argument to avoid responsibility for making potentially libelous claims. Given the enormous influence Powell (by representing Trump) and these other conservative stars hold on the Republican electorate, the essence of the argument is jaw-dropping. They are arguing, in a court of law, that they should not be held accountable for their statements because most people should know that their statements are not true. Whether their viewers and listeners are “reasonable” is another matter, but one need only look at Antonio and the Capitol riot to know that ludicrous, baseless statements are often widely believed. Alex Jones is another example. In April 2017, Jones, the host of InfoWars, was in a heated custody battle with his ex-wife, Kelly. In making her case against Jones, Kelly argued that Jones was ""not a stable person” and that his manic rants—which included claims that the Sandy Hook mass shooting and the moon landing were staged—were often overheard by their children (since Jones broadcast from home). But Jones' lawyers argued that his on-air rants should not be taken seriously because he was in fact a ""performance artist"" who was merely ""playing a character.""  To judge Jones based on his on-air personality, his lawyers argued, would be akin to judging ""Jack Nicholson based on his performance as The Joker."" But Jones, of course, is not Jack Nicholson nor some random shock jock with a handful of listeners. His fans consider him a valued source of political information. His website, InfoWars, garners 10 million monthly visits, which is more than some highly respected mainstream outlets receive. In 2015, Donald Trump appeared on Jones’ show and told him that his reputation was “amazing.” Jones even helped fund the rally that occurred before the Capitol riot. So however earnest or disingenuous Jones’ public proclamations, they can’t be disregarded as harmless “performance art.” But the question remains: Does Jones believe what he says? The answer can be found not only in his custody defense but also in the apologies he’s made. After Jones helped spread the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory, for example—which claimed that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were running a sex ring out of a D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong—the owner of the pizzeria threatened Jones with a libel suit. Jones not only apologized but retracted his allegations. Then, after families of Sandy Hook victims forced Jones to undergo a sworn deposition, Jones acknowledged that the shooting was real and claimed that he had been suffering from “a form of psychosis” when he denied it. One must conclude that Jones’ custody defense was accurate: He is a showman and an opportunist and should not be taken seriously. On a broader level, it’s time to admit, once and for all, that this is an apt description of the entire conservative political-media conglomerate. Fewer and fewer serious thought-leaders occupy positions of influence on the right. People like the aforementioned and so many of their colleagues are the ones with the stranglehold on the Republican electorate. And they do not exist to enlighten. They exist to sell a product to a demographic that craves a particular worldview. This is not breaking news, of course, but it’s noteworthy that some of the most influential conservative pundits are finally admitting it—even if it’s being forced out of them in a court of law. This disingenuousness extends to entire networks, as well. Take One America News, an increasingly influential conservative news channel. For a story published in April, Marty Golingan, a producer at OAN, told The New York Times that he believed his channel’s misinformation helped spark the Capitol riot. Moreover, he claimed that most OAN employees did not believe Trump’s voter fraud claims even though the network frequently promoted them. Checking his claims, the Times interviewed 18 current and former employees and found that 16 of them backed Golingan, agreeing that the channel ran stories that were “misleading, inaccurate, or untrue.”  (Twelve OAN employees ultimately quit in the wake of the riot.) While we expect a measure of hyperbole in our political speech—indeed, the First Amendment allows for wide latitude with such speech—we should not allow that speech to become so unhinged from reality that it undermines Americans’ basic faith in democracy. Donald Trump’s “Big Lie” did just that. In fact, Republicans are increasingly cloaking themselves in the First Amendment to justify all kinds of mendacious, destructive speech, apparently unaware that free speech is not absolute. Just as you can’t yell ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theater, you should not be allowed to yell, over and over on popular media outlets, without evidence and for cynical political purposes, that a voting machine company rigged an election. Because in the end, what’s a worse consequence: a mad rush for the exits in a darkened theater or an attempted coup that kills five? In spreading his “Big Lie,” Trump was aided by people like Powell, Jones, Carlson, Rudy Giuliani, Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs (these last three are being sued by Smartmatic, another voting systems company) and so many like them. But again, these are entertainers and lackeys, not serious commentators. The evidence—indeed, their own courtroom admissions—is increasingly bearing this out. One more example bears repeating. In September 2020, a federal judge dismissed a defamation suit against Fox News brought by Karen McDougal, the former Playmate who claimed she had had an affair with Trump. What prompted McDougal to file the suit was Tucker Carlson's on-air claim that she had attempted to extort Trump by alleging the affair. But Fox's lawyers succeeded in getting the suit tossed by arguing that Carlson's statements ""are not reasonably understood as being factual."" U.S. District Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil agreed, ruling that ""Given Mr. Carlson's reputation, any reasonable viewer arrives with an appropriate amount of skepticism about the statements he makes."" Tucker Carlson has been widely mentioned as an early frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. An appropriate amount of skepticism, indeed.",2021-05-29 22:31:16,The Truly Sinister Message Behind the Right’s Defense of Its Lies,"finances,medicine and health,news and news media,diseases and conditions",1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

News By Tina Moore, Sam Raskin and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon Submit May 30, 2021 | 6:39am				| Updated May 30, 2021 | 6:53pm Two people were killed and more than 20 wounded early Sunday in a mass shooting at a rap concert in the Miami area, police said. Cops said three gunmen jumped out of an SUV and fired into the crowd with assault rifles and handguns in the suspected targeted shooting just after midnight at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County. “I am at the scene of another targeted and cowardly act of gun violence, where over 20 victims were shot and 2 have sadly died,” according to a tweet from Miami-Dade Police Department Director Alfredo “Freddy” Ramirez III. “These are cold-blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice. My deepest condolences to the family of the victims.” Ramirez told CBS that the attack was a “targeted act of gun violence.”Eight people were taken to the hospital by medics and at least a dozen victims went to various area hospitals by private means, according to reports. The shooting at the El Mula Banquet Hall broke out just after midnight at a concert west of Miami Gardens, Ramirez said, according to the Miami Herald. The hall, inside the Country Club Shopping Center, had been rented out for a rap concert as part of a Memorial Day weekend album release party, according to the Miami Herald. Ramirez told the newspaper that a white Nissan Pathfinder pulled up and the three shooters stepped out with assault rifles and handguns and opened fire on the crowd. Police said video of the shooting suggests it was a targeted attack. The footage shows the suspects sitting in the SUV for up to 40 minutes before moving in and unleashing a hail of bullets around 12:30 a.m. — as the crowd poured out of the concert, CBS-TV in Miami reported. Police are still searching for a motive and said they are reviewing social media accounts of rappers at the concert to determine if they were engaged in a feud or had received any threats. The rapper who was the focus of the album release party, ABMG Spitta, was shot in the ankle during the shooting, authorities said. The gunmen fired “at least 100 rounds,” including from assault weapons, law enforcement sources told the station. Miami-Dade County Mayor Danielle Levina Cava said she was “horrified” by the holiday weekend carnage. “Horrified and heartbroken by this start to the holiday weekend,” she tweeted. “I urge our community to be safe and smart. Please—don’t let any more lives end in senseless violence.” Within hours of the shooting, relatives of the victims gathered outside Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital — some joining hands in prayer. “Words can’t explain how I feel right now,” Chad Harris, whose 19-year-old daughter was among those shot, told WSVN-TV.  “She’s in surgery right now. We’re just praying.” The Miami-area mass shooting comes after a disgruntled San Jose railyard worker Samuel Cassidy allegedly killed nine and injured multiple people on Wednesday. It was also the third shooting in the Miami area since Thursday, when three people were injured in a shooting and car chase near Casino Miami Jai-Alai, the Miami Herald said. On Friday, one person was killed and six wounded in a drive-by shooting in Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood, the newspaper reported.

335,https://spectator.org/george-floyd-wokeism-religion/,"   Roughly one year ago, a religious Reformation occurred. Over the years, I and many other writers have compared left-wing political “wokeness” to a religion — noting the philosophy’s endless rules, supposed martyrs, sacred spaces, debates about heresy, and even vision of the fallen world after original sin (“the System”). But it seems fair to say that a more aggressive and missionary version of the faith took root last year, following the unfortunate and symbolic death of George Floyd. A national movement rapidly coalesced around the idea of largely or completely defunding the police, while elected officials up to and including the president mouthed critical catchphrases about “systemic racism” and “white supremacy.” American schools teaching full-on critical theory as part of the standard curriculum became a real possibility and the basis of a heated national debate. But crime statistics and other empirical data indicate that the promise of today’s new secular faith is a false one and that we should beware of wolves in sheep’s clothing when listening to its prophets. Analogies between wokeness — Wokeism? — and conventional religion have been made many times, by authors ranging from John McWhorter on the political center-left over to Ann Coulter on the right. I myself wrote a well-received piece along these lines in The American Spectator last year. There are obviously more than a few similarities between faith of the old-timey variety and the modern idea that facially neutral “Systems” are all subtly structured to oppress minorities or the poor (“racism is the everyday”), and heroes are needed to fight this latent evil. The new ideology also boasts acclaimed martyrs such as Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, points of pure faith (such as the claim that racism must explain all performance gaps between groups), prophets ranging from Ibram X. Kendi to attorney Benjamin Crump, and a plentitude of holy places and “sacred spaces.” There is even a concept of original sin, which might be summed up as “privilege” — all people are born with a certain degree of advantage conferred on them by our corrupt systems, which the more fortunate must reject in order for moral purity to be possible. While often made in fun, the wokeness-to-religion comparison holds up well and has been made for years. We have, however, witnessed a rapid and dramatic surge in the faith after the tragic police killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Within the boundaries of the famous analogy, it seems fair to say Wokeism had a Judaism-to-Christianity or Catholicism-to-Protestantism-style Reformatory expansion following that day. Without being at all sarcastic, one can say that Floyd died in fairly classic fashion for a martyr, apparently being killed — however much other factors contributed to this outcome — under the knee of a modern-day centurion, a uniformed big-city police officer. Not long after Floyd’s death, the area of Minneapolis where his arrest took place was made — in a fairly literal sense — into a holy place. Now known as “George Floyd Square,” several city blocks in center-city Minneapolis now exist as a police-free “autonomous zone,” home to murals, sculptures, and small shrines symbolic of the Black Lives Matter movement. The Christian Post religious resource notes that “a number of” religious groups now hold services and conduct baptisms at the exact “site where George Floyd died in Minneapolis.” More than a few people claim to have witnessed miracles there. More broadly, during the past year (1 AF, or one year After Floyd?), fundamental changes to modern American society, extending far beyond one section of one city, have been proposed. Probably the most widely commented on of these has been the idea of defunding the police. Although progress toward actually enacting this ambitious agenda appears to have stalled, Minneapolis City Council members promised to dismantle the city’s entire police department and “create a public safety system” within two weeks of the day George Floyd “died under the knee of white police officer Derek Chauvin.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey describes his council as having “made a pledge before the entire nation to abolish and defund the police department.” As at least a good-faith gesture toward this goal, it appears that roughly $8 million was shifted away from policing and toward ambiguous “violence prevention” in the latest Minneapolis budget. As I noted in Quillette earlier this year, other cities said similar things and took more aggressive steps toward making them happen. In New York City, roughly $1 billion was slashed from the most recent annual police budget. While some of these cuts were future-focused, they also caused the cancellation of the 1,200-person class of officers scheduled to enter the New York Police Academy in August 2020. Similarly, in Los Angeles, the budget was slashed by $150 million, causing the dissolution — so far — of the Department’s Animal Cruelty Task Force and Sex Assault/Special Victims Unit. While some advocates of such large-scale defunding preferred to use euphemistic or ambiguous language, at least one major guest op-ed in the New York Times laid all cards on the table: published June 12, 2020, it was headlined “Yes — We Literally Mean Abolish the Police.” Still more broadly, such once-fringe academic ideas such as “systemic racism” — basically the idea that all facially neutral systems (for example, IQ testing) encountered during everyday life are set up to subtly oppress — and slavery reparations suddenly became features of everyday conversation during 2020. Speaking to Congress following the conviction of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, President Joe Biden identified widespread “systemic racism in our criminal justice system” as a national problem and called on Americans to “come together” to “root [it] out.” In another significant speech, he called out systemic racism and “white supremacy,” both of which the country’s top man apparently considers to be ongoing problems, vowing to change laws that “enable discrimination.” The president and the at least equally passionate Vice President Kamala Harris hardly speak alone on this topic. A simple Google search for “systemic racism USA” turns up a variety of sometimes-entertaining results, ranging from Business Insider’s “26 simple charts to show friends and family who aren’t convinced racism is still a problem in America” to “7 Ways We Know Systemic Racism Is Real” from ice cream vendor Ben & Jerry’s. Even America’s schoolchildren have not been spared from this swift cultural swing leftward. Think-tank researcher Chris Rufo, whom in the interest of full disclosure I’ll mention I know and like, has received a great deal of media exposure for documenting the recent expansion of previously niche critical theories into American primary and secondary education. His website, www.christopherrufo.com, contains a number of examples of this, ranging from the disturbing to the hilarious. To take a typical one, the superintendent of schools in the bucolic Portland suburb of Tigard, Oregon, just pledged to “dismantle systemic racism,” deploy formal “Equity Teams” within the schools, and establish racially segregated “Student Affinity Groups.” The district, which serves a city of perhaps 50,000 residents, where only 636 Black people live — both Rufo and I checked — has an official Department of Equity, which apparently aims at revamping the curriculum to align with the pedagogical theories of Marxist Brazilian writer Paulo Freire. Of course, the same sort of thing is hardly unknown in the big city. As I once noted in the pages of this august publication, Manhattan’s Fieldston School recently renamed Newton’s Laws of Physics “the three fundamental laws” in an effort to “decenter whiteness.” Another well-known New York City School, East Side Community High, sent the parents of every enrolled white student a home-addressed letter breaking down various supposed ways to exist in the USA as a white person and encouraging each of them to become a “white traitor” (if not a “white abolitionist”). At least one parent recently went internationally viral after opting to yank his daughter out of yet another New York City school — Brearley, which costs $54,000 per year — in the wake of a wave of similar Wokeism that he compared to “the Chinese Cultural Revolution” in a widely circulated letter. One phenomenon associated with the current Wokist resurgence is quite classically religious — a Miraculous Multiplication of holy persons and objects. Both immediately before and right after the Chauvin verdict, it became extraordinarily apparent that mainstream mass media had no intention of moving on from the claim of epidemic police violence, whatever the decision in the officer’s case happened to be. Within literally two days of the verdict, the following headlines ran in major newspapers and other periodicals: “Six people were killed by police in the 24 hours after Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murder” (Business Insider), “6 police killings occurred in the 24 hours after verdict in Chauvin trial” (Axios), “Police Officers Killed Six People in the 24 Hours After Chauvin Verdict” (Slate), “A verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial, then 6 police killings across America in 24 hours” (Chicago Tribune), and “After Derek Chauvin verdict, 6 killed by police across America in 24 hours” (Oregon Live). Today, the names of Daunte Wright, Adam Toledo, and Ma’Khia Bryant are all nearly as well known as Floyd’s. In all senses of this word, the services continue. This seems as good a time as any to point out that I myself am a rather lapsed Catholic, if not an agnostic, and I favor intense scrutiny of the pretty-sounding claims of all religious divines. While Floyd’s death was a tragedy, and I shed no tears for his incarcerated killer, it is important that thinking people unpack the rapidly developing creation myths of today’s radical and self-labeled “Second Civil Rights Movement” before these become nearly literal canon — set in stone and socially impossible to challenge. First, it is important to remember that most BLM martyrs are not martyrs in truth — innocents murdered in cold blood by rampaging agents of the state. Daunte Wright, out on bail for illegal pistol possession and fleeing the police, was accidentally shot by an officer reaching for what she thought was her Taser — while he attempted to flee the police. Adam Toledo was an alleged Latin Kings gang member nicknamed “Lil’ Homicide,” who was shot after police responded to a report about shots being fired at moving vehicles — and apparently just seconds after dropping a gun. Perhaps most remarkably, Ma’Khia Bryant was holding a butcher’s knife and attempting to stab another young Black woman at the time of her shooting. While the death of a minor is always a sad event, it is simply not the case that all-white squadrons of racist cops are patrolling America’s streets, executing people at will. During the most recent year currently on record, the total number of unarmed Americans shot by police officers was well under 100. The number of unarmed Black Americans killed in this manner was exactly 18. Many Wokist points of faith collapse similarly. The ambiguous idea of systemic racism provides perhaps the best example of this. In most cases, in mass media analyses or qualitative academic ones, systemic racism is illustrated simply by demonstrating a difference between two racial groups regarding some important outcome — for example, arrest rates or test scores. Kendi, a Wokist prophet if I have ever seen one, has argued eloquently that essentially all such group performance gaps must be due either to inherent inferiority on the part of one group or to racism, no matter how impossibly difficult such subtle (or nonexistent) bigotry might be to unearth. But this claim is perilously close to being plain nonsense. As serious economists like Tom Sowell and June O’Neill have pointed out at some length, adjusting for cultural characteristics that obviously vary between large racial groups — such as median age, study time, test scores, and the region where folks choose to live — causes most group gaps in variables such as income to shrink to almost nothing. Unsurprisingly, in this light, seven or eight of the top 10 income-earning groups in the USA (depending on how you count South Africans) are hard-working minority populations composed largely of immigrants. Indian Americans currently hold the top U.S. spot financially, ranking roughly $136,000 per year on average, versus $65,000 or so for white Americans. Absent the actual genocidal reality that might make them sadly necessary, many Wokist solutions are revealed to be overreactions likely to produce only chaos and harm. This is no mere conjecture. In 2020, there was probably the greatest one-year surge in murders in recent U.S. history, with killings rising from 15,020 in 2019 — by no means a remarkably peaceful year — to perhaps 20,000 last year (this is an estimate based on raw data; these figures will be released in September). Murder surged across virtually every major city and even across the seasons: the Quillette piece cited above notes that homicides were up 42 percent during the summer and 34 percent during the fall versus 2019. Such chaos, predictably, hit Black Americans and the poor the hardest. In my hometown of Chicago, 81.8 percent of those murdered during 2020 were Black, while about 4 percent were white. In long-suffering nearby Minneapolis, almost unbelievably, an attempted drive-by mass shooting took place in “George Floyd Square” on the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s death. Piety is a good thing, in measure. But it is a very good idea for tax-paying citizens to apply the same level of scrutiny to which we now subject our traditional religions to this new one — and, probably, to seek out an actual church or a synagogue rather than a “People’s Autonomous Zone” if they happen to want a spiritual moment.

339,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/30/two-dead-more-than-20-hurt--florida-banquet-hall-shooting,"First published on Sun 30 May 2021 13.02 BST At least two people were killed and more than 20 injured in Miami early on Sunday as attackers opened fire on concertgoers outside a banquet hall. It was the city’s second deadly mass shooting in little more than 24 hours. A police spokesman said the shooting happened in the Hialeah area when three people got out of a white SUV and began firing on a line outside the El Mula banquet hall. The attackers, whom witnesses said were wearing ski masks and hoodies, used assault rifles and a handgun, authorities said.  “These are cold-blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice,” the Miami-Dade police director, Alfredo Ramirez, said in a tweet. “This is a despicable act of gun violence, a cowardly act,” he told the Miami Herald. “This type of gun violence has to stop. Every weekend it is the same thing. This is targeted, this is definitely not random.” No suspects were in custody and authorities indicated they expected the death toll to rise. Marcus Lemonis, a Miami businessman and CNBC television host, offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. On Friday night, a drive-by shooting in Wynwood left one dead and six wounded. Authorities were alerted by ShotSpotter, an audible detection system that relays the sound of gunfire. A law enforcement source said officers who arrived to find victims lying in the road outside the rented party venue likened that scene to “a war zone”. With almost all pandemic restrictions lifted, visitors have swelled numbers in Miami, a popular vacation destination, for the Memorial Day weekend and the Urban beach week hip-hop music festival. Police have not said if they believe the shootings are linked, but said that it appeared the victims were targeted in both attacks. After the Friday incident, detectives found shell casings from at least two types of weapon. In the Sunday incident, authorities said, eight wounded were taken to hospital by ambulance, at least three in critical condition. A further 12 people went to local hospitals on their own, the Herald reported. TV crews at the scene counted almost 100 evidence markers, a likely indicator of the number of shots fired. Angela Green, whose 24-year-old son was at the concert, told reporters at Jackson Memorial hospital he was shot in the stomach but was expected to survive. “He called us frantic, saying he had been shot, that it hurts and that he loves us,” Green said. “My husband was like, ‘No, stay with us.’ He said the guys came with ski masks and hoodies and just started shooting up the crowd.” Art Acevedo, chief of the Miami police department, a separate jurisdiction to Miami-Dade detectives investigating the shooting, blamed political inaction for failing to curb gun violence. “We had our own shooting the night before where seven people were shot and one dead,” he told CBS’s Face the Nation. “It’s just an indication of the problem we have with the scourge of gun violence in this country that we need to do much more at a federal level to stop. “We need universal background checks. We need to make burglarising licensed gun stores a federal crime with mandatory sentencing. And we need the federal government and both sides to address this issue because without legislation, without certainty as it relates to holding these criminals accountable, we’re never going to get through the summer without much more death and destruction.” Gun control is stalled in the divided US Senate, following the passage of two bills by the House. Joe Biden announced in April his own series of executive orders designed to address the “international embarrassment” of gun violence in America. A Guardian database published last week details every mass shooting in the US since 2014. Ramirez told the Herald he was concerned by levels of gun crime in Miami. “It is very difficult to stop a small amount of individuals who want to go out there and commit murder, and it takes all of us to stop this,” he said. “We really have to put the work in this summer to keep our children and community safe.”",2021-05-30 08:02:08,Two dead and more than 20 injured in Florida banquet hall shooting,"firearms,murders and attempted murders,violence",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

That’s where he had heard the rapid-fire sound of gunshots early Wednesday morning. Now, all was eerily quiet. “Hey, you guys all right?” he shouted, his voice echoing in the cavernous building. Where were Jose, Lars, Alex? “Tim?” he yelled. “Do you need help?” Tim Romo was the 49-year-old power crew foreman, the one who operated the crane whenever Bertolet, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, and his guys were installing 1,000-pound switches. Only Romo and his crew had the special training to get close to the 800-volt overhead lines that powered the VTA light rail trains. Minutes earlier, as he barricaded himself in the signal room, Bertolet had heard Romo yelling, “Call the police! Call the police!” Now, in the petrifying silence, Bertolet was trying to find him. Alone, he turned down the empty hallway toward the power department, a 20-by-30-foot room where Romo’s crew kept computers and battery chargers and a coffee pot and where they crowded around a conference table each morning to plan out the fieldwork for the day. Bertolet made it to the end of the hallway, running through the list in his mind of what he would do if he encountered the unthinkable: stop the bleeding, apply pressure, perform CPR. Instead, he reached the power room and gaped at the horror. “I walked into something nobody should ever see.” Six of his co-workers, all men, lay motionless on the floor in their blue work suits. He looked for signs of life, squeezing past the conference table to the far side of the room. But quickly he knew: “There was nothing you could do.” Four days later, authorities are still piecing together — and the close-knit community of transit workers is only beginning to process — the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting. The facts sound disturbingly familiar: A 57-year-old “highly disgruntled,” heavily-armed mechanic murders nine co-workers, then kills himself as officers confront America’s latest “active shooter.” In interviews this past week with VTA workers and union representatives, relatives of the shooter and family members of his victims, a picture emerges of unbridled terror and true heroism on a day that started like any other, in a workplace that prides itself on toughness and grit. As Samuel Cassidy carried out his slaughter, working his way from Building B next door to Building A, which houses operations, he deliberately chose his victims, authorities said. At one point, he reportedly told a survivor, “I’m not going to kill you today.” Two men — supervisor Paul Megia and rail operator Taptej Singh  — alerted their co-workers to hide and ushered them to safety, then were killed themselves. One woman — a substation maintenance worker who was in the same meeting where Bertolet’s six co-workers were slain — curled into a ball on the floor and was somehow spared. The gunman also showed mercy to union president John Courtney, who was in that meeting but hasn’t opened up publicly about what he called “this unfathomable tragedy.” In a letter to the 1,600 VTA workers who his Amalgamated Transit Union Local 265 represents, Courtney wrote: “There simply are no words to describe what happened and what I saw. It will stay with me forever.”  VIDEO: How the Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting unfolded in San Jose’s light rail yard Wednesday’s tragedy began unfolding at 5:39 a.m. when Cassidy emerged from his home on Angmar Court in South San Jose. A neighbor’s security camera across the street captured grainy images of Cassidy carrying a black duffel bag to his white Ford F-150 parked in the driveway. The camera zooms in as he fumbles with his keys and loads the bag into the passenger seat. The video is fuzzy in the soft morning light just before sunrise, but the wide bands of reflective tape crisscrossing his back are clear. The boxy blue jacket he wore wasn’t part of his uniform — the heavy cotton shirt and pants he wore underneath — but instead, a distinctive Carhartt safety coat that co-workers said had been his signature. The neighbor with the security camera told reporters that Cassidy lived alone, never had visitors and never said hello. When Doug Suh turned into his driveway once, he said, Cassidy yelled at him. Suh’s wife was scared of Cassidy. Before Cassidy left the house that morning and drove the eight miles north to the job he held for 20 years, he put a pot full of bullets on the stove, authorities said, and placed an accelerant nearby. In less than an hour, the house would be ablaze. The fire erupted just as Cassidy unleashed a barrage of bullets in the VTA conference room. It’s not entirely clear what Cassidy did or said before he pulled out one of three semi-automatic handguns he was carrying and opened fire. A VTA spokesperson refuted reports that Cassidy was facing a disciplinary hearing that morning. Bertolet would later hear a first-hand account of what happened in that room from the woman who survived. She said Cassidy got up and said something like, “This is how the union treats people,” then pulled a handgun from his satchel. “She went down on the ground and curled up in a fetal position thinking she was going to die,” Bertolet said the woman told him. “And Sam looked at her. She looked up and saw him looking at her, and he moved beside her and started shooting everyone that was on the ground.” Then, she told Bertolet, even after her fellow crew members were shot, Cassidy aimed at each one of them again and fired off “another couple of rounds for everyone.” Bertolet had heard the shots and the screams from the signal room on the other side of the building. The walls don’t reach the ceiling in the warehouse-like building and sound travels easily. He called the control center that connects directly with the county communications office. “We have an active shooter!” Bertolet exclaimed, as he and two co-workers piled carts and chairs against the door. He hid in the back of the room and texted “I love you” to his wife of 40 years, Diane, and their three children. “I wanted to at least let them know how I felt if I didn’t make it,” Bertolet said, choking up. He wished he had his own gun, he said, so he didn’t feel so helpless. When the shooting stopped in his building, he heard over the radio that the shooter was heading across the yard to Building A, where the rail operators and supervisors work. He had cooked up a plan in his mind: He would run outside, get in his red Dodge Ram and run over the shooter. “I was willing to take a 3,000-pound truck against a 9 mm (handgun) any day,” he said. But when he stepped out the back door to find frantic people pouring out of Building A, he quickly realized, “I couldn’t do anything.” Cassidy, meanwhile, was heading up the stairs of Building A, where he used to work as an electro-mechanic. Taptej Singh, a 36-year-old light rail operator with a wife and two young children at home, had heard the commotion on the VTA radios. He immediately started calling his co-workers to hide and shepherding others to safety, his relatives said they were told by survivors. “He put a lady in a control room to make sure she was safe,” his brother, Bagga Singh, said. Singh’s 42-year-old supervisor, Paul Megia, was doing the same. He hurried Cecilia Crowder into his office, locked the door from the outside, and told her “Don’t let anyone in.” Then he continued to try to help get others to safety. It wasn’t long before Crowder said she heard gunfire outside the door. In their efforts to save their co-workers, both Singh and Megia found themselves face to face with the killer. “I’m really sorry,” Crowder told Megia’s family and loved ones at a vigil Friday. “Paul saved my life.” Over the radio, Bertolet heard the pop, pop, pop of the shots that felled Singh and Megia in the next building. Another light rail operator, Adrian Balleza, was killed, too. Then he heard a friend in the control room on the third floor shouting, “He’s up here!” Somewhere in that building, as sheriff’s deputies closed in, Cassidy turned one of his three semiautomatic handguns on himself. In under 10 minutes, he had fired 39 rounds. He had about 10 times that amount of ammunition when he arrived. In the aftermath of the carnage, the familiar question that is asked again and again is: Why? Investigators and the VTA have not yet provided an answer. But in interviews with the Bay Area News Group, Cassidy’s ex-wife, Cecilia Nelms, told reporters that he was always seething during their 10-year marriage that ended in 2005, took antidepressants and spoke more than once of killing his colleagues. His sister, Ann, told this news organization he was often tense and “quick to suspect bad intentions toward him, almost verging on paranoia.” He “seemed fine” to his parents two days earlier when he visited them at their Cupertino home to take his mother’s car for a smog check, and Ann wonders if something triggered him on Tuesday. A month earlier, Cassidy blew up in a confrontation over the radio at work with an operations center employee who asked him about finishing a job. “If you say something nasty to (Operations Control Center),” one worker told the Bay Area News Group, “they’re going to report it, and things are going to happen.” If Cassidy was reprimanded, the VTA won’t say. The agency said it is reviewing all its records that involve him and whether there are any reports of Cassidy making employees “fearful or uneasy.” Nothing has been easy in the last year for the VTA. Two employees died of COVID and 150 others were sickened. Conflicts flared between management and the transit union over safety protocols and hazard pay. In March, California’s workplace safety regulator fined the authority for pandemic safety violations. In April, VTA’s computer systems were breached in a cyberattack, and in a random and bizarre incident, someone shot a long black arrow into the back of a VTA worker on a work break as he walked through a San Jose neighborhood. Wednesday’s tragedy has indefinitely stopped the trains. Bertolet has been one of the few VTA workers who experienced the horrors of that day to tell his story. He has cast a light on a rough-and-tumble work culture that he says is not for the thin-skinned. Working with high voltage electricity is some of the most dangerous work in the business. Fixing overhead lines in truck buckets, crews wear heavy cotton uniforms to protect themselves from burning arc flashes. Anything polyester would melt onto their skin. “We’re basically brutal to each other. We’re a bunch of blue-collar guys and we beat up on each other all the time,” Bertolet said. Still, he said, “if you can’t deal with people who are going to talk straight up to you, you shouldn’t be there.” For the most part, though, he said, crews get along, spending their breaks together, sharing meals and joking around. They often gather around outdoor barbecues at lunchtime, grilling thick steaks. Cassidy never joined them. Cassidy had worked at the VTA for two decades, most recently as a substation maintenance worker, “but he never fit in,” Bertolet said. Some of Cassidy’s co-workers knew him to harbor gripes, about being assigned undesirable jobs or working without a safety partner and, recently, about changes to vacation rules. Bertolet didn’t often cross paths with Cassidy, but when he did, he remarked on Cassidy’s royal blue heavy-duty jacket. “Most of us wore the issued uniform,” Bertolet said. “But he always wore that (jacket) over it.” Bertolet said he is haunted by discovering his mortally wounded friends: Romo, “always the life of the party” and “superman” to his wife and three kids; Abdolvahab “Abdi” Alaghmandan, the “gentle soul” who could fix anything; Jose Hernandez III, a mechanic following in his father’s and uncle’s footsteps at the VTA; Lars Kepler Lane, who loved to whip up gourmet meals; Michael Rudometkin, whose wife will miss his bad jokes and bear hugs; and Alex Fritch, who will miss his son’s high school graduation this week and a planned trip to Hawaii in September to renew vows with his wife, Terra. She crawled into his hospital bed to hold him just before he died Wednesday night. Bertolet could see how they never stood a chance. With only one door and a tight squeeze around the conference table, “if you were in that room and somebody started shooting, you’re trapped.” He sought counseling for the first time Friday. He wasn’t able to stop the shooter, but at least he could console the woman who had survived. He had tucked her into his truck as she cried.Related Articles

			What happened during Mayor Sam Liccardo’s meeting with President Biden on gun violence? When the shooting was over, law enforcement officers gathered the terrified workers together and escorted them across the parking lot. They followed a trail of blood, Bertolet said, past the shooter’s body. Officers had ferried it on the hood of a patrol car, then, at San Pedro Street, placed it on the curb. Bertolet didn’t recognize the shooter at first — until somebody said, “That’s Sam.” Then he noticed the royal blue jacket. “Aw Christ,” he said, “that’s him.” Staff writers David DeBolt, Leonardo Castañeda, Robert Salonga and Ethan Baron contributed to this report.

X OUR PICKS: I wonder now where many of my fellow citizens, who (20 years ago) were whining about the large influx of Hmong and other Southeast Asians, were themselves a half century ago. If any of them, or any of their relations were in the armed forces or in the pool of young men anticipating the draft, they should have been aware that Hmong and other peoples of Southeast Asia were risking, and often losing, their lives and the lives of their families for the benefit of us and our government’s policies. The Hill peoples protected our western flank, the Annimite Cordillio, and Laotian highlands, at a terrible and continuing cost. Because of this, countless American lives were spared, and indirectly the requirement for more Americans to be drafted was reduced. Whatever one’s views on the war were, the Hmong people threw in their lot with us, and they lost everything in the bargain. Unlike many of our foreign-born forefathers who have, no doubt, paid their debt to America in the wars of the last two and a half centuries, the Hmong people paid their debt of blood in advance, and with no guarantee it would be honored. They arrived with the same burdens and problems that the Germans, Irish, Italians, Scandinavians, Hispanics, Jews and Muslems all carried within their steamer trunks, carpet bags and dirty bedrolls. They came ill and injured, heartbroken and terrified, not yet with skills for their new country, some driven to crime, an inability to easily adapt, and for a time, dependent on our social welfare system. (If there had been a comparable social welfare system during the migrations of the previous centuries, how many more of our forbears might have survived the pestilent slums and horrors of poverty and lived full lives?) The Hmong did arrive with much that we had lost: strong family structure, where the old are not warehoused, the young are not left unattended and the unable are not abandoned. They have in their two score years among us become doctors, nurses, teachers, soldiers, police and firefighters. They have bought homes, built businesses and attained elective office. There may well be among them a Jonas Salk, Marie Curie, Marconi or Edison. From them, their children or children’s children there will come symphonies, plays and books, stories and pictures, and we all of us are made better. There are few of us in this country of the dispossessed who do not have an ancient warrant outstanding, an empty noose or broken shackles in our families’ journey to this place, but few have willingly paid such a high price in advance. We are, and have been, lucky to have these fine people among us. Tom Dunne, St. Paul
The writer is president of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 320  Admittedly, there are bad apples in every profession, and they cause harm and injury to their victims. But, why only police reform?  How about media reform, judicial reform, political reform, etc.? I am the father of two law enforcement officers, the grandfather of two more and the uncle of another two. I feel it should be mandatory that every elected lawmaker, from the top down, do a two-week ride-along in a patrol car before they take office and make judgments concerning police officers. As no civilian has the least amount of knowledge of the stress and instant decisions police have to make on a daily basis, this would be an eye-opening experience in their effort to make fair and sensible decisions Jerry Jensen, Woodbury  Here is why so many of us portray Israel, not the Palestinians, as the criminal culprit in the latest round of Mideast violence: It is Israel which has expropriated Palestinian lands and removed the Palestinian landowners with no right of recourse. The Israeli courts do not recognize Palestinians as the rightful owners of lands which have been in their families for generations. Of course the Palestinians will oppose this expropriation by any means at their disposal. Huron Smith, Mendota Heights  Two existing St. Paul buildings at the Selby-Western intersection, the Blair House built in 1888, and the Dakota Building built in 1879, provide insights into why many neighbors oppose the proposed 695 Grand Avenue-Dixies development. The five-story, lot-filling, residential/commercial building proposed for 695 Grand shares many similar features with the existing five-story, lot-filling, residential/commercial Blair House. This similarity becomes important because over the past 132 years the Blair House has cost and lost millions of dollars for almost all of its private investors and public agencies. St. Paul and the neighboring blocks have suffered long years of the Blair House as an empty, dark, massive community intrusion. The Dakotah Building, by contrast, a three-story building with setbacks and open space on its two community facing sides, has been almost continuously occupied, profitable for investors and supported by the neighborhood.  The Dakotah’s W.A. Frost restaurant remains admired throughout Minnesota. Community members who have lived on or near Grand for a decade or more, believe that the proposed five-story, 695 Grand Avenue structure’s long-term impact on the community will repeat the experience previously imposed by the all too similar Blair House. Ted Lentz, St. Paul  This past week, the media reported another mass shooting in the United States, this time at a business in San Jose, California. Nine people died. That makes over 200 mass shootings in this country so far this year. (A mass shooting is defined by the Congressional Research Service as an incident involving at least four victims.) Overall, 15,000 people have died as the result of gun violence in this country so far this year, including mass shooting incidents. Though the percentage of households that own guns has remained stable for years (between 47% and 39% since 2007), the number of guns owned in this country has climbed from 47 million in 1945 to 347 million by 2012, a more than six-fold increase. At the same time, “(t)he U.S. population increased from 133 million in 1945 to 313 million in 2012, a 135% increase in population, or over a 200% increase in the number of guns per capita. Guns per capita rose from .35 in 1945, to 1.1 guns per capita in 2012″ (GunWatch blog site). “Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related homicide rate is 25 times higher” (Wikipedia). Now, I ask you, has the increase in the number of guns made this country safer? The answer is clearly no. So, why do we still believe that increasing the number of guns in this country will make us safer? Who benefits from this myth? It is the gun and ammunition manufacturers and their sellers to the public. It is time to debunk this myth. We are not getting safer. We are becoming an even more dangerous country for our citizens. Now, the Texas legislature has passed a law that permits the purchase of guns without a license. Are we crazy? Why think that something that hasn’t worked for years will somehow magically start to change this record of failure? New Zealand’s parliament took only one month to outlaw assault style weapons after the horrific attack on mosques in Christchurch that killed 51 people in 2019. I grew up believing the United States was an exceptional country, but not this kind of exceptional. We need sensible gun regulations in this country, now.

His sister, Ann, told this news organization he was often tense and “quick to suspect bad intentions toward him, almost verging on paranoia.” He “seemed fine” to his parents two days earlier when he visited them at their Cupertino home to take his mother’s car for a smog check, and Ann wonders if something triggered him on Tuesday. A month earlier, Cassidy blew up in a confrontation over the radio at work with an operations center employee who asked him about finishing a job. “If you say something nasty to (Operations Control Center),” one worker told the Bay Area News Group, “they’re going to report it, and things are going to happen.” If Cassidy was reprimanded, the VTA won’t say. The agency said it is reviewing all its records that involve him and whether there are any reports of Cassidy making employees “fearful or uneasy.” Nothing has been easy in the last year for the VTA. Two employees died of COVID and 150 others were sickened. Conflicts flared between management and the transit union over safety protocols and hazard pay. In March, California’s workplace safety regulator fined the authority for pandemic safety violations. In April, VTA’s computer systems were breached in a cyberattack, and in a random and bizarre incident, someone shot a long black arrow into the back of a VTA worker on a work break as he walked through a San Jose neighborhood. Wednesday’s tragedy has indefinitely stopped the trains. Bertolet has been one of the few VTA workers who experienced the horrors of that day to tell his story. He has cast a light on a rough-and-tumble work culture that he says is not for the thin-skinned. Working with high voltage electricity is some of the most dangerous work in the business. Fixing overhead lines in truck buckets, crews wear heavy cotton uniforms to protect themselves from burning arc flashes. Anything polyester would melt onto their skin. “We’re basically brutal to each other. We’re a bunch of blue-collar guys and we beat up on each other all the time,” Bertolet said. Still, he said, “if you can’t deal with people who are going to talk straight up to you, you shouldn’t be there.” For the most part, though, he said, crews get along, spending their breaks together, sharing meals and joking around. They often gather around outdoor barbecues at lunchtime, grilling thick steaks. Cassidy never joined them. Cassidy had worked at the VTA for two decades, most recently as a substation maintenance worker, “but he never fit in,” Bertolet said. Some of Cassidy’s co-workers knew him to harbor gripes, about being assigned undesirable jobs or working without a safety partner and, recently, about changes to vacation rules. Bertolet didn’t often cross paths with Cassidy, but when he did, he remarked on Cassidy’s royal blue heavy-duty jacket. “Most of us wore the issued uniform,” Bertolet said. “But he always wore that (jacket) over it.” Bertolet said he is haunted by discovering his mortally wounded friends: Romo, “always the life of the party” and “superman” to his wife and three kids; Abdolvahab “Abdi” Alaghmandan, the “gentle soul” who could fix anything; Jose Hernandez III, a mechanic following in his father’s and uncle’s footsteps at the VTA; Lars Kepler Lane, who loved to whip up gourmet meals; Michael Rudometkin, whose wife will miss his bad jokes and bear hugs; and Alex Fritch, who will miss his son’s high school graduation this week and a planned trip to Hawaii in September to renew vows with his wife, Terra. She crawled into his hospital bed to hold him just before he died Wednesday night. Bertolet could see how they never stood a chance. With only one door and a tight squeeze around the conference table, “if you were in that room and somebody started shooting, you’re trapped.” He sought counseling for the first time Friday. He wasn’t able to stop the shooter, but at least he could console the woman who had survived. He had tucked her into his truck as she cried.Related Articles

          / CBS/AP Two people died and over 20 people were injured in a shooting outside a concert in South Florida, police said. The gunfire erupted early Sunday at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah, police told news outlets. The banquet hall had been rented out for a concert. Three people, armed with assault rifles and handguns, got out of an SUV and opened fire on the crowd outside, police director Alfredo ""Freddy"" Ramirez III said. Authorities believe the shooting was targeted. ""These are cold blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice,"" Ramirez tweeted. I am at the scene of another targeted and cowardly act of gun violence, where over 20 victims were shot and 2 have sadly died. These are cold blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice. My deepest condolences to the family of the victims. Two people died at the scene, police said. Over 20 people went to various hospitals for treatment. No arrests were immediately announced. ""This is a despicable act of gun violence, a cowardly act,"" Ramirez told reporters, according to CBS Miami. ""… This type of gun violence has to stop."" Chad Harris was among the stunned parents who learned of the incident. His 19-year-old daughter was one of those wounded. ""My daughter ended up getting shot in the middle of this,"" Harris said. ""Words cannot express how I feel right now. It's a sad moment."" For police, this shooting is a worrying reminder that the nation is returning to normal from the COVID-19 pandemic, which means that violence like this will return, too. On CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Miami Police Chief Art Acevedo warned of a violent summer and urged lawmakers to act. ""We need the federal government, and both sides to address this issue because without legislation, without certainty as it relates to holding these criminals accountable, or we're never going to get through the summer,"" he said. Even before Sunday's shooting, local leaders have been proposing a $10 million plan to stem gun violence, which would include jobs for underserved young people and more surveillance cameras in high crime neighborhoods. One philanthropist is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspects in this latest shooting. Manuel Borjorquez contributed to this report.

Three people stepped out with assault rifles and handguns and began shooting “indiscriminately into the crowd,” according to a police statement. By the time they left, two people were shot dead and anywhere from 20 to 25 others suffered gunshot wounds. One of the injured is in critical condition. Officers who arrived at the scene found bodies lying on the floor and likened the scene to “a war zone,” a law enforcement source tells the Guardian. Miami Dade Police Director Alfredo “Freddy” Ramirez III called the incident “another targeted and cowardly act of gun violence” on Twitter. The shooting took place outside El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County in the Hialeah area. The banquet hall was hosting an album release party that included performances by several local rappers. “We believe this is a targeted act of gun violence,” Ramirez told the Miami Herald. No arrests have been announced and police are asking for help to try to locate any suspects. It was the second major shooting in the area over Memorial Day weekend. One person was killed and six others wounded in a drive-by shooting late Friday in the Wynwood area of Miami. Officials haven’t said whether they think the two shootings are connected. “It is very difficult to stop a small amount of individuals who want to go out there and commit murder,” Ramirez said.

          / CBS News The following is a transcript of an interview with Miami Police Chief Art Acevedo that aired Sunday, May 30, 2021, on ""Face the Nation."" JOHN DICKERSON: There has been an uptick in violent crime in major cities recently. Breaking overnight in Miami Dade, two people were killed and more than 20 wounded in a mass shooting at a concert at a banquet hall. Art Acevedo is the chief of Miami police. Good morning, Chief. CITY OF MIAMI POLICE CHIEF ART ACEVEDO: Hey, good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: So I know this shooting was not in your jurisdiction, but can you tell us anything more about what happened last night? ACEVEDO: Well, I can tell you, that's the second shooting in the greater Miami-Dade area. We had our own shooting the night before where seven people were shot and one dead. So that's 30 shot, two dead in the greater Miami area, Metro-Dade area- Miami-Dade area. And it's just an indication of the problem we have with the scourge of gun violence in this country that we need to do much more at a federal level to stop. JOHN DICKERSON: You wrote after that shooting on Friday night, you wrote, ""Mass shootings continue to occur on a regular basis across our country. And yet elected officials only talk about the militarization of the police on the left and gun rights on the right. Gun violence is a public health epidemic our nation needs to address."" How do you think that public health epidemic, as you call it, should be addressed? ACEVEDO: Well, first and foremost, they- they need to come out of their own corners, the left and the right, and come to the middle, which is where most Americans are. We need to have universal background checks. We need to- we need to make burglarizing these licensed gun stores a federal crime with mandatory sentencing. And we need the federal government and both sides to address this issue because without legislation, without certainty as it relates to holding these criminals accountable, we're never going to get through the summer without much more death and destruction. Not to mention the fact that our criminal court system across this country is absolutely at a standstill. They are not moving cases, thousands of felons running around and cases languishing three to five, six years before they even go to court. We've got to get our system back- back on track. JOHN DICKERSON: Is that backlog of cases, which has been a result of the pandemic, is that related to the gun violence or is that just an adjacent issue that you're concerned about? ACEVEDO: I think that that backlog started before the pandemic and for example, Harris County, where I came from in Houston, there are 60,000 felons running around facing charges. Almost 2,000 murderers running around and our criminal justice system is at a standstill. It's time for the president, Congress and governors to get our court system up and running. It's OK to focus on making policing better, but I assure you, there weren't- there weren't 30 police officer shootings in Metro Dade County this weekend. The American people deserve greater safety. And it starts with the presidential commission, getting our criminal justice system back online and having real consequences for these felons that are carrying these firearms that are not afraid of death, but they are afraid of state prison. And we need to deliver some safety to the American people. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned that you were the chief in Houston. In Texas legislators approved a bill earlier this week that allows people to carry handguns in public without a license, background check or training. The governor is likely to sign that into law. So as the police try to do their job, will that help or hurt the police do their job? ACEVEDO: Look, there's something that God gave us and that is common sense, and common sense tells us that that is ridiculous. Law enforcement, police chiefs, sheriffs, police, labor came- stood up together and made it real clear we do not support constitutional carry here in Texas or anywhere in this country. And so most American gun owners don't support constitutional carry. But again, you know, it's a slogan. It appears, if Governor Abbott signs that, that we support the blue. They only support the blue in word. It's now a time to support the blue in deed, by vetoing that bill. You're either with law enforcement or you stand with the fringe that believe that everybody should have a firearm regardless of their character, their capabilities or their mental capacity. JOHN DICKERSON: So what- what does that mean on the police end, though, if they're- if guns are being carried in that manner? ACEVEDO: That means that we will not be able to even question someone as to their intent. That means that we won't be able to take any action until that person draws that firearm, walks into that theater and decides to shoot. We are better than this. Americans are better than this. And I think it's time for the- the common sense to rule the day instead of the- the rhetoric and the out of touch left and right. And sadly, the rest of us are stuck here in the middle. JOHN DICKERSON: You are the president of the Major Cities Police Association. And that association reported some numbers on crime in this year so far. Twenty two percent increase in homicides, 8.5% increase in aggravated assaults. Why is- why are those numbers up? ACEVEDO: Well, it's a multi- multi reasons. Number one, we have been dealing with COVID. Number two, our- our American court system has been pretty much shut down. There haven't been jury trials in large numbers in a long time across our country. And number three, we've entered an era in our American psyche where our politicians have forgotten how violent our cities used to be. So we've fallen in love with criminal justice reform. And for example, in Harris County, you've got Commissioner Rodney Ellis, who believes that no one should be held pre conviction because this is a constitutional right. Well, I've got news for Mr. Ellis. Go talk to the people in Harris County who are being shot, gunned down, the children that're being buried because we're not holding people pretrial. And the last thing is we have not been taking these criminals to court, put them through trials when it's taking three to five years to put people through a trial and they're running free, the results are what we're seeing: a tremendous increase in gun violence in this country. And unless we all start speaking up, speaking out and demanding our elected officials take action, we're going to see a lot more bloodshed. And I'm very sad to say that this summer's going to be a long summer for the American people. JOHN DICKERSON: A year ago, George Floyd was killed and you said, ""It makes me worry about the good police officers and it makes me worried about the extended community."" A year later, what's your state of worry in the country and what's your view on the police reforms that you've seen so far? ACEVEDO: Well, it's significant. It's significant because the George Floyd Act, it seems that both sides are at a standstill. The Major City Chiefs have put together some very thoughtful positions on this, and we're hoping that the members of Congress will take heed and use it as a guiding principles and document. But my worry and I think the worry of my colleagues across the country is that as we continue to talk about defunding the police, instead of- instead of making the police better and investing in good policing-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. ACEVEDO: --and on the right, we're talking about more guns for everybody. JOHN DICKERSON: Chief,-- ACEVEDO: It's going to be a long summer. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Chief, we've run out of time. We're very grateful for your time. Stay safe and we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. First published on May 30, 2021 / 11:52 AM © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

We are working with local authorities to bring justice to the perpetrators. Justice needs to be swift & severe!” DeSantis tweeted. Businessman and TV personality Marcus Lemonis, star of “The Profit,” took to Twitter to offer a $100,000 reward to help authorities capture the suspects. Related Articles

News By Sam Raskin and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon Submit May 30, 2021 | 12:14pm				| Updated May 30, 2021 | 5:18pm Miami’s top cop on Sunday denounced “the scourge of gun violence” in the US and called for stronger gun laws following a deadly shooting outside a local rap concert. Miami-Dade Police Director Art Acevedo said on “Face the Nation” on CBS that elected officials need to step up and enact stricter gun legislation. “It’s just an indication of the problem we have with the scourge of gun violence in this country, that we have to do much more at the federal level to stop,” Acevedo told host John Dickerson. “They need to come out of their own corners — the left and the right — and come to the middle, which is where most Americans are,” he said. “We need to have universal background checks, we need to make burglarizing these licensed gun stores a federal crime with mandatory sentencing,” the chief said. “We need the federal government and both sides to address these issues.” “Because without legislation … we’re never going to get through this summer without much more death and destruction,” he said. “The American people deserve greater safety.” Acevedo was speaking just hours after three gunmen jumped out of an SUV outside a Miami-area banquet hall and sprayed a crowd of patrons with gunfire, killing two and wounding more than 20, police said. “My worry is as we continue to talk about defunding the police, instead of making the police better and investing in good policing, on the right we’re talking about more guns for everybody,” the chief said. “And it is going to be a long summer.” “You’re either with law enforcement or you stand with the fringe and believe that everybody should have a firearm, regardless of their character, capabilities and mental capacity.” “Gun violence is a public health epidemic,” he added. The Sunday morning shooting came after two other shootings on Thursday and Friday in the Florida city. “This is the second mass shooting event in our region this weekend,” Acevedo said in a post on Twitter on Sunday. “If we don’t fully mobilize as a society against it, it will get worse before it gets better.” Read Next Teacher, 35, ‘had sex twice at her home with her teen bo...

After a second mass shooting in the Miami-area left at least two dead and an estimated 20-25 others wounded, Miami Police Chief Art Acevedo argued Sunday that rising gun violence must be met with serious prison time for those prohibited from possessing firearms – while ""firearms belong in the hands of law-abiding Americans."" ""All of us in the greater Miami-Dade area must stand together against acts of violence, and our criminal justice system must throw the book at prohibited persons unlawfully caught with firearms, Acevedo tweeted. He said most of these ""cowardly misfits"" don’t fear death, but do fear long prison sentences. The Miami Dade Police Department announced a $100,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest or conviction in the shooting that happened around 12:30 a.m. at a scheduled event at a banquet hall in on 186th Street in the Hialeah area to the west of Miami Gardens. The reward was provided by Camping World CEO and TV personality Marcus Lemonis to help authorities in his hometown. Police say several patrons were standing outside an establishment hosting a ""scheduled event"" when an SUV approached the front of the business, three suspects exited the vehicle and began ""shooting indiscriminately at the crowd."" The suspects then got back into the SUV and fled.

Miami Dade Police director Alfredo ""Freddy"" Ramirez III said he arrived at the scene of ""another targeted and cowardly act of gun violence"" where more than 20 victims were shot and two died. ""These are cold blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice,"" he wrote. ""My deepest condolences to the family of the victims."" WTVJ reported that is happened outside a release party for a local rap artist at El Mula banquet hall. The Miami-Dade Police Department’s homicide bureau is investigating the mass shooting. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue initially responded and determined two victims were deceased on scene and transported eight others to various hospitals in Miami-Dade and Broward counties.

The gunfire erupted early Sunday at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah, police told news outlets. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)
      (AP) More than 12 other victims were brought by others to various hospitals. Officials say that as many as 25 could have been hurt, as numbers fluctuate. Police said at least one was in critical condition. The deceased victims were not initially identified by authorities.

Also speaking Sunday during an appearance on CBS’ ""Face the Nation,"" Acevedo argued that members of Congress ""need to come out of their own corners the left and the right and come to the middle where most Americans are"" in addressing the rise in gun violence seen across the nation. ""We need to have universal background checks, we need to make burglarizing these licensed gun stores a federal crime with mandatory sentencing, and we need the federal government and both sides to address this issue because without legislation,"" Acevedo said. ""Without certainty as it relates to holding these criminals accountable, we’re never going to get through this summer with much more death and destruction."" Acevedo, also president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said that the criminal court system in the U.S. is ""absolutely at a standstill"" and is not moving cases, leaving ""thousands of felons running around and cases languishing three to five to six years before they even go to court."" ""We have go to get our system back on track,"" he added. A year after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act has so far come to a standstill in the Senate, and Acevedo said his major cities group has put forward some thoughtful positions for lawmakers to consider in creating federal police reform. ""My worry is as we continue to talk about defunding the police, instead of making the police better and investing in good policing, on the right, we’re talking about more guns for everybody,"" Acevedo said. ""And it is going to be a long summer."" ""This is another despicable, cold-blooded act that resulted in two people dead and nearly 25 injured,"" Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava tweeted about the latest shooting. ""My heart breaks for the families of the victims of the mass shootings this weekend. We will do everything we can to bring the shooters to justice & turn the tide on this violence.""

359,http://feeds.dailykosmedia.com/~r/dailykosofficial/~3/C8Z4mm_GQ58/-Embracing-my-identity-as-a-Korean-American-activist-is-empowering-and-a-responsibility,"This story was originally published at Prism. By Seo Yoon Yang On the night of Tuesday, March 16, a white male shooter targeted three spas in Atlanta and nearby Cherokee County, killing eight individuals, six of whom were Asian women. I wish I could say I was surprised, but I’m not. I live only a two-hour drive away in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and even before the pandemic I’ve been called names like “chopsticks” and “P.F. Changs” and experienced racist harassment as a student activist. The intersection of racially motivated hate and gun violence is unfortunately part of our American gun violence epidemic narrative, and the Atlanta shooting simply highlighted that fact. Instead, I’m surprised that our leaders still haven’t taken proactive measures to prevent such incidents, including ones that emphasize the severity of hate crimes. “Eight dead in Atlanta spa shootings, with fears of anti-Asian bias.” “Captain who said spa shooting suspect had ‘bad day’ no longer a spokesman on case, officials say.” “He said a sex addiction is why he killed Asian women.” I spent the first 48 hours constantly refreshing Google and scanning headlines as details about the shooting were slowly released. As a devout gun violence prevention student activist, I’ve found myself in similar situations numerous times: spending an afternoon refreshing a page to learn about the victims of a shooting. But as a member of the Korean and larger Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, this shooting struck a very personal chord. Within the past 12 months, the organization Stop AAPI Hate has recognized 3,800 incidents of hate crimes targeting the AAPI community. These attacks range from verbal abuse to assault and murder, with an overwhelming number of hate crimes focused against AAPI women. Yet even in the face of these devastating statistics, Georgia law enforcement and President Joe Biden didn’t officially categorize or acknowledge the Atlanta shooting as a hate crime, although law enforcement said “nothing was off the table” in determining motive. Instead, the shooter’s actions were rationalized and advertised by many as the result of having a “bad day.” The root causes and the widespread implications of this shooting transcend the defense of simply having a “bad day.” Everyone has bad days. My bad days—bursting into tears after defending the rights of undocumented immigrants and being called an “Asian b***ch” in the school hallway—have often stemmed from the inherent discrimination woven into our American culture. However, I haven’t used them as an excuse to commit violence. The Atlanta shooter’s “bad day” cost eight people their lives and resulted from the centuries-old intersection of racism, discrimination, xenophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, misogyny, and gun violence. And it’s frustrating that it apparently took countless attacks on Asian Americans—many of them elders—culminating in this recent mass shooting to motivate a national uprising and awareness of AAPI hate among the general public, mainstream media, and our political leaders. For the last three years, I’ve worked as a student advocate pushing for gun sense legislation after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting impacted my then-community of South Florida. I’m grateful to have learned more about the influence of systemic racism within the statistics and patterns of gun violence and its disproportionate impact on Black and brown communities. However, largely due how the AAPI community is often portrayed as “successful”—which erases the struggles of different Asian and Pacific Islander ethnicities within the AAPI umbrella—and the harmful “model minority” myth, I’ve observed time and time again how AAPI experiences are often erased from the narrative of American racism and hardship. Even in my activist community where I expected recognition of AAPI hate, I’ve faced numerous microaggressions. At a leadership conference I was even told that I was “ungrateful” for wishing there was more AAPI representation in our history curriculum, and yelled at for “not representing all the minority groups equally.” The honest truth about being an AAPI activist in the gun violence prevention movement is this: Your entire activism is a constant balance of privilege and recognition. In the discussion of the disproportionate impacts of gun violence, many in the AAPI community can find ourselves in a grey area among white communities and Black and brown communities. I try to uplift the communities most impacted by gun violence while also drawing attention to the unique challenges faced by my own community. I’ve had numerous conversations defining who I am within the AAPI community and finding a balance of highlighting my personal struggles living in the South and attending a homogenous school, while recognizing that my story is less than a fraction of the multidimensional, infinite narrative of the AAPI community. It’s a very careful and evolving understanding that I am constantly working on because it’s important to my goals as a gun violence prevention activist and as a Korean American. It can be complicated, but perhaps it’s these intricacies of our identities and the roles we play in society that truly make this work so worthwhile and gratifying. But more importantly, these last few months have both reinforced and identified allies the AAPI community has in its corner, as well as reminded people of the long history and effects of AAPI activism. During the aftermath of the Atlanta shooting, friends and colleagues in the gun violence movement sent texts ranging from, “I am thinking about you and everyone in the AAPI community <3” to, “a little reminder that you are a good and kind and lovely person.” It’s these moments of pure love and appreciation, persevering through the media reports of such a hateful tragedy, that give me hope and make this work worth fighting for.

        Tanya Chen Last updated on May 31, 2021, at 11:56 a.m. ET Posted on May 30, 2021, at 3:09 p.m. ET Shooters opened fire at crowds in two separate incidents in the Miami area over the weekend, leaving 3 people dead and at least 26 people wounded, and prompting a local police chief to call for action on the ""epidemic"" of gun violence. On Friday, one person reportedly died and six others were injured at a party-and-event space bordering the Overtown and Wynwood areas. On Sunday, three assailants wounded at least 20 people, and two people were pronounced dead at a concert in a neighboring city. Both incidents were drive-by shootings, and the suspects are still at large. According to the Miami Herald, the Miami Police Department was first called to the scene Friday by an automated system that alerts police to gunfire sounds. A law enforcement source told the Miami Herald that they suspect ""one or two people may have been targeted"" by the shooter, but the shooter fired ""indiscriminately"" into the crowd at the party. Friends and family rushed six wounded attendees to nearby hospitals, and one of them reportedly remains in critical condition. Miami police did not immediately respond to inquiries from BuzzFeed News. Then, early Sunday, the Miami-Dade Police Department responded to calls of a shooting at a banquet hall that had been rented out for a concert in Hialeah, a city in the Miami metropolitan area. Two people were found dead at the scene, with at least 20 people wounded, Miami-Dade police confirmed to BuzzFeed News. They have not yet released the names of the victims, but both people who died were men. Police said that at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday, three people got out of a white SUV, a Nissan Pathfinder, and began shooting ""indiscriminately"" into the crowd standing outside the venue before fleeing. Surveillance video released by police on Monday showed the entire incident lasted only a matter of seconds. *RELEASE OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE* We are releasing video footage of the vehicle/subjects involved in the shooting that occurred in Northwest Miami-Dade on 5/30/21 that left two deceased and 21 others injured. Anyone with information is URGED to contact @CrimeStopper305 immediately. Miami-Dade Police Director Alfredo Ramirez III told reporters that they used assault rifles and handguns, and it appeared they were targeting someone attending the event as they fired at the crowd. He offered his condolences to the victims and also shared his frustration. ""This type of gun violence has to stop,"" he said. ""Every weekend, it's the same thing."" Police are continuing to investigate both incidents and have asked the public to share any information about who is responsible. The back-to-back mass shootings in the Miami area have left people rattled, and others online are calling for it not to be normalized. Art Acevedo, the chief of police of the Miami Police Department, tweeted Saturday — before the second shooting — that the gun crimes happening ""on a regular basis across our country"" should be treated like a public health crisis. Mass shootings continue to occur on a regular basis across our country &amp; yet elected officials only talk about the militarization of the police on the left and gun rights on the right. Gun violence is a public health epidemic our Nation needs to address. https://t.co/0CE9zAjqBQ ""This is second mass shooting event in our region this weekend. If we don’t fully mobilize as a society against it, it will get worse before it gets better,"" he continued to tweet Sunday. ""Firearms belong in the hands of law-abiding Americans of sound [mind], more [must be] done to keep them out of the wrong hands."" As of Sunday, 17,883 people have died from gun violence this year, and more than 15,000 have been injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The organization has also recorded 237 mass shootings. Tanya Chen is a social news reporter for BuzzFeed and is based in Chicago. Contact Tanya Chen at tanya.chen@buzzfeed.com.

A Southern California community was rocked early Sunday after a person claiming to be a resident left a lengthy diatribe on Reddit threatening a mass shooting. But sheriff's department investigators now believe that the person mentioned in the post was a victim of ""swatting"" – a prank or false emergency report which causes a large police response. They say there is no credible threat to the public. Lakewood officials wrote on social media that the real person named in the post has ""cooperated fully"" with sheriff's department investigators. They said the Sheriff's Department would be investigating further to determine who was behind the fake post. In the original Reddit post, a person identifying themselves as ""Gaston Aaron Mcwhinnie"" said he has lived his whole life in Lakewood, a city about 20 miles south of Los Angeles. ""Mcwhinnie"" claimed he is unemployed and has always had a negative home life. He also claimed in the post that despite being black himself, he hates minorities. Lakewood city council members say they are aware of the threat. 
      (Facebook: @LakewoodCalifornia) He then threatened he was going to go around the city with an ""AR-15"" and ""Glock 18"" and ""will be shooting every minority in sight."" ""I am aiming for at least 10, but the more the better,"" the post read. ""I will be targeting council members of the city."" At the end of the post, ""Mcwhinnie"" said he had left a 192-page manifesto ""rationalizing and explaining my hate towards minorities."" MIAMI POLICE CHIEF CALLS FOR ‘SERIOUS PRISON TIME’ FOR ILLEGAL GUN POSSESSION AFTER LATEST MASS SHOOTING Included in the original post is a picture of what appeared to be a Glock 18 laid on top of army camouflage. City officials said the Lakewood Sheriff’s Department does not believe the threat was credible but would be taking the necessary steps to address the post and the person who allegedly made it. Fox News has reached out to city council but did not immediately hear back. Council Member Todd Rodgers said on Twitter that city council is aware of the threats. He said police do not believe they are credible but would be investigating. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By Sunday afternoon, the original post appeared to have been deleted.

So, he’s educated. He was going out with his educated cousin to just celebrate the weekend, and they had not made it into the club as of yet.” Green was among the victims’ relatives who gathered outside Jackson Memorial Hospital following the 12:30 a.m. shooting at El Mulla Banquet Hall, where three men jumped out of an SUV and opened fire on the crowd as it left a rap concert. Another parent, Chad Harris, told reporters outside the hospital that he was waiting for word on his 19-year-old daughter’s condition, he told WSVN-TV. “Words can’t explain how I feel right now, man,” Harris said. “She’s in surgery right now.

366,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/uganda-police-killings-reconstructed-using-mobile-phone-footage,"Interviews with more than 30 witnesses also used in investigation by BBC Africa Eye into deaths in Kampala Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 09.08 BST A single truck carrying eight police officers was responsible for a mass shooting in the centre of the Ugandan capital, Kampala, in November last year in which at least four people died and many more were injured, an investigation by BBC Africa Eye has found. The shootings were part of a crackdown on protests in Kampala following the arrest of opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, a singer turned politician known as Bobi Wine, who was campaigning as a candidate for presidential elections held two months later.  More than 50 people were killed and hundreds hurt by security forces and police over two days in the capital and elsewhere. President Yoweri Museveni won a sixth term in office in the polls, which opposition politicians said were fraudulent. Officials initially said that any casualties had been criminals and violent rioters, before admitting that some innocent people had died after being hit by “stray bullets”. Images posted on social media showed police in Kampala firing indiscriminately at people in buildings overlooking the protests and unidentifiable men in plainclothes, believed to be security personnel, firing automatic weapons. More than 350 people were arrested, police said. The BBC Africa Eye investigation, released on Monday, reconstructs the killing of four people on Kampala Road as well as the death of a 15-year-old boy and the serious wounding of two women elsewhere in the capital. The analysis of more than 300 video clips from mobile phones and interviews with more than 30 witnesses strongly suggests that all were shot by police or soldiers and that none were engaged in any criminal activity or protest. Authorities in Uganda admitted the vehicle identified in the investigation was a police patrol car, but said they had no information linking it to indiscriminate shooting. Mobile phone videos and photographs show the patrol truck passing within metres of Kamuyat Ngobi, a 28-year-old mother of four, who collapsed and died with a single bullet in the head seconds later. A shot is heard on recordings as the police truck passed her. Ngobi earned her living cooking and selling food to local businesses and had made a delivery to a local shop moments before she was killed. Images of her bloody body show smashed plates of food she was carrying to her grandfather in a nearby building. “If I ever see the person who shot Kamuyat I will ask them to shoot me too. What hurts me most is that I will never see her again,” said Zikaye Takumala, her mother. The same police vehicle continued along Kampala Road, passing a restaurant where two people were shot and injured. After driving another 60 metres, it passed John Amera, a 31-year-old father of two and mobile phone shopworker who was shot in the chest and killed. The next victim was 23-year-old Abbas Kalule, who was hit in the upper thigh and died in hospital four days later. The police truck then turned north-east and passed John Kitobe, who had come into Kampala to change money. The 72-year-old retired accountant was hit in the neck by a bullet and killed. During the minute or so that the shootings lasted, there were burning road blocks on the Kampala Road, but none of the victims appear in any way involved in any protests. BBC Africa Eye has also analysed a video that shows a “drive-by” shooting of two sisters, Shakira Nyemera and Shamim Nabirye, on Jinja Road in Kampala on the same day. The women are seen among a small group of local people sheltering from the unrest in a sidestreet and watching the road. A convoy drives past, at least one shot is heard and the two women collapse. Both women survived but doctors were unable to save Nabirye’s three unborn triplets. “I lost my children and I loved them,” she said. Ugandan authorities claim to have no record of two women shot on Jinja Road, and said the incident had not been reported to the police. The investigation also includes new evidence in the case of Amos Ssegawa, a 15-year-old boy who was walking home with his mother, Hajarah Nikitto, when he was hit in the face by a bullet. Eyewitnesses said that Amos was killed by Ugandan soldiers shooting from a military vehicle. The teenager was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival. “It was the military that shot my child,” said Nikitto. Ugandan authorities confirmed that her son was killed on 19 November, but again attributed his death to a stray bullet. A government spokesman told the BBC that innocent victims will be compensated, but that verification takes time. During the unrest in November, Brig Flavia Byekwaso, a military spokesperson, described “a war-like situation” that meant the army “has to deploy”. Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, has acknowledged that he reinforced security before the elections by deploying special forces who “killed a few” people he described as terrorists.",2021-05-30 19:01:07,Uganda police drive-by killings revealed using mobile phone footage,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,police,demonstrations and riots",623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said President Joe Biden has “innate Senate negotiating skills.” | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Here’s an eye-opener this Sunday morning: some new stats on the surge in gun sales, from Northeastern University and the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. “[A]bout a fifth of all Americans who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners. And the data, which has not been previously released, showed that new owners were less likely than usual to be male and white. Half were women, a fifth were Black and a fifth were Hispanic. In all, the data found that 39 percent of American households own guns. That is up from 32 percent in 2016.” More on that trend from NYT’s Sabrina Tavernise THE ART OF THE (INFRASTRUCTURE) DEAL … It certainly sounds like Republicans want to make a deal on infrastructure. At least, that’s the clear takeaway from the WaPo’s look into White House negotiations with Senate Republicans, who were eager to lay the compliments on thick when talking about President JOE BIDEN with reporter Seung Min Kim. — Sen. MIKE CRAPO (R-Idaho) called Biden “a straight shooter.” Sen. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO (R-W.Va.) said Biden has “innate Senate negotiating skills.” And Sen. ROY BLUNT (R-Mo.) said Biden “understands the importance of finding a place where everybody can be moving forward.” It’s a “spoonful of sugar” approach: They claim that in an Oval Office negotiating session May 13, Biden gave a clear impression that he would be satisfied with a $1 trillion package spread out over eight years. That’s a far cry from the White House’s recent $1.7 trillion counteroffer to the GOP, which included $400 billion for long-term care, something Republicans have said is a hard “no.” Now, if Biden doesn’t hold up his side of what (Senate Republicans claim) he agreed to, it will look not only like he reneged on his promise, but that his “straight shooter” image is a facade. — Worth noting, on timing of a potential deal: “We are getting pretty close to a fish-or-cut-bait moment,” Transportation Secretary PETE BUTTIGIEG said on CNN’s “State of the Union” this morning, suggesting a resolution one way or the other in the next few days. A message from Amazon: Watch what happened when Amazon raised their starting wage to $15/hr in 2018. THREE MORE IMPORTANT SUNDAY STORIES: — Alex Isenstadt on the GOP’s 2024 “shadow primary.” Republican presidential hopefuls have figured out a way “to put themselves out there without poking the eye of former President DONALD TRUMP, who has made clear that he’s interested in a comeback bid” — namely, by getting involved in the 2022 midterms. “[Sen. TOM] COTTON is part of a growing list of potential Republican presidential hopefuls diving head-first into the battle for the House majority in 2022,” reports Isenstadt. “Former Secretary of State MIKE POMPEO headlined a Tuesday evening fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ex-U.N. Ambassador NIKKI HALEY has endorsed a handful of female candidates and hosted receptions for newly elected GOP women in the House. Texas Sen. TED CRUZ is backing a trio of conservative House candidates, including one for whom he’s cut a direct-to-camera video.” — NYT’s Ross Douthat on the coronavirus “lab leak” theory and why it matters. Here’s a provocative thought: “Because the lab leak theory was associated early on with Republican China hawks … and eventually picked up by the Trump administration, there was self-reinforcing pressure — among journalists who covered the story and Twitter experts who opined on it — to put the possibility in the QAnon box and leave it there. “I will leave it to the reader to consider how a similar pressure might manifest itself in other areas, from the 2020-21 murder spike to the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence, where journalists might wish to avoid making concessions to conservative interpretations of reality.” — Texas Tribune’s Alexa Ura runs through the sweeping election changes underway in Texas. There are two main reasons why what’s happening in Texas is generating so much attention: the process Republican legislators are using to speed the bill through, and the legislation’s massive implications for elections in the state. The process: “In the course of several hours Saturday and early Sunday, [Texas] Senate Republicans hurtled to move forward on a sweeping voting bill negotiated behind closed doors where it doubled in length and grew to include voting law changes that weren’t previously considered. Over Democrats’ objections, they suspended the chamber’s own rules to narrow the window lawmakers had to review the new massive piece of legislation before giving it final approval ahead of Monday's end to the legislative session.” The policy: “[T]he GOP’s priority voting bill emerged Saturday from a conference committee as an expansive bill that would touch nearly the entire voting process, including provisions to limit early voting hours, curtail local voting options and further tighten voting-by-mail, among several other provisions. … The new provisions include language from separate Republican bills that failed to pass that would set a new voter ID rule for mail-in ballots, requiring voters to provide their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number, if they have one, on their applications for those ballots. For their votes to be counted, voters will be required to include matching information on the envelopes used to return their ballots.” Good Sunday morning. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza, Tara Palmeri. MORE SUNDAY BEST … — Buttigieg on the budget proposal on “Fox News Sunday”: “This is a responsible budget, and importantly, all of the proposals for spending and investment in this budget are paid for. It’s one of the reasons why, if you look into the out years, the deficit actually starts going down. But you can’t get something for nothing. In the near term, we know that we need to make major investments in our roads and bridges, in our education, in our health. We cannot afford not to do these things.” — Capito on the prospects for a bipartisan infrastructure deal on “Fox News Sunday”: “We’re building those blocks towards a really good, solid infrastructure package that has bipartisan support. So we’re responding to what the president has said — he told me on the day before yesterday, ‘Let’s get this done.’ And I think that means that he has his heart … in this. We have had some back and forth with the staff who have sort of pulled back a little bit, but I think we’re smoothing out those edges.” A message from Amazon: All Amazon employees earn at least a $15/hr starting wage.

PHOTO OF THE DAY: A small dog named Prancer takes place in a Memorial Day weekend parade in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Saturday. | Sean Rayford/Getty Images THE WHITE HOUSE BIDEN WEIGHS IN ON TEXAS ELECTIONS BILL — “‘Assault on democracy’: Biden torches Texas voting bill,” by Ben Leonard: “‘It’s part of an assault on democracy that we’ve seen far too often this year — and often disproportionately targeting Black and Brown Americans,’ Biden said in a statement. ‘It’s wrong and un-American. In the 21st century, we should be making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote.’ … In his statement Saturday, Biden called for Congress to take action on the ‘For the People Act,’ which has passed the House and would reform ballot access and campaign finance.” GROWING SUPPORT FROM HISPANIC VOTERS — “Biden is getting a big bounce with Hispanics,” CNN’s Harry Enten: “Biden is doing better overall now than he did in the election. His approval rating is at 55% in the Gallup data we’re using here. Even controlling for a higher approval rating overall, Biden has had a disproportionate rise in support from Hispanics. He’s now doing 17 points better with Hispanics than overall, while he was doing 10 to 14 points better with them in the 2020 election. “Keep in mind, too, that unlike in an election, there are undecideds allowed in a poll. If we allocate undecideds equally between approval and disapproval for both Hispanics and overall, Biden's approval rating is about 20 points higher with Hispanics than overall in Gallup polling. … This 20-point gap between how Hispanics and adults overall feel about Biden is wider than the last Democratic president saw in his first months on the job.” HOW THE BUDGET ADDRESSES RACE — “Efforts to Advance Racial Equity Baked In Throughout Biden’s Budget,” by NYT’s Michael Shear: “Sprinkled throughout the president’s enormous spending plan are scores of programs amounting to tens of billions of dollars intended to specifically bolster the fortunes of Black people, Asian people, tribal communities and other historically underserved groups in the United States. … That idea — of focusing special attention on the distribution of taxpayer money across racial groups — has never been approached as methodically as it has this year by Mr. Biden, advocates say.” BEHIND THE CURTAIN — “WH legislative team pursues ‘politics is personal’ strategy,” by AP’s Alexandra Jaffe and Josh Boak: “While Biden pitches his infrastructure plan to the American public with events at an Ohio college, a Ford plant in Michigan or an aging Louisiana bridge, this is where the real work of delivering his legislative agenda takes place: in phone calls to Capitol Hill, over Zoom meetings and during the occasional cup of coffee with members of his legislative affairs team. “Biden’s legislative team of 15 is charged with maneuvering and mapping out the process of actually getting his agenda passed on Capitol Hill. Led by LOUISA TERRELL, a Capitol Hill veteran, the team has had a vast footprint over the course of Biden’s first months in office, holding over 553 phone calls or meetings with lawmakers, their chiefs of staff and staff directors focused on the American Jobs Plan alone, Biden’s infrastructure package, as of May 21.” POLICY CORNER INFLATION WATCH — “Fed’s Taper Talk Is Pre-Emptive Strike Against Inflation Fears,” by Bloomberg’s Craig Torres and Joe Deaux: “The post-pandemic economic-growth surge, which has pushed up prices on everything from bicycles to lumber, has Fed officials on alert. While calling inflation ‘transitory,’ they are also starting to wonder whether a slow response by the economy’s supply side — the millions of companies and people who make things and provide services — could result in several quarters of high inflation readings that start to creep into consumer psychology. “The public conversation officials are having about tapering is a surprising shift because only a month ago, [Fed Chair JEROME] POWELL was skeptical that actual inflation or expectations would move up in a lasting way ‘while there was still significant slack in the labor market.’” NO NEW APPLICANTS — “Paycheck Protection Program Closes to New Applications,” by WSJ’s Amara Omeokwe: “The federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program closed to new applications Friday as funding was on track to be exhausted. That marked the end of a $961 billion emergency effort that helped millions of small businesses survive the pandemic but was dogged by fraud claims and criticism that it didn’t reach the neediest businesses. The program had been scheduled to end on May 31, but the Small Business Administration on Friday said in a notice to lenders that ‘due to the high volume of originations today, the portal will be closing for new originations’ that evening.” PANDEMIC STILL OUT OF REACH FOR SOME — “Foster and migrant kids shut out from Covid vaccinations,” by Sarah Owermohle: “While drugmakers are studying how well Covid-19 vaccines work in babies as young as a few months old, there is no timeline for when shots will be fully approved for teens or kids. That means thousands of youth already disproportionately at risk for chronic health conditions, and many without regular access to health care, could be last in line for a vaccine the Biden administration has said is essential to returning children to school and ending the pandemic. “The dilemma poses a major test for the Administration for Children and Families, a little-known part of the Health and Human Services Department that is responsible for keeping unaccompanied minors at the border safe along with overseeing programs for childcare, foster children and family services. The Biden administration has already redirected more than $2 billion from health programs to address a record influx of migrant children into its custody, hoping to avoid the kind of scrutiny over children in its care that beset the Trump administration.” A message from Amazon:  Amazon supports increasing the federal minimum wage to $15/hr AMERICA AND THE WORLD MUST-READ ON THE PIPELINE HACKERS — “Secret Chats Show How Cybergang Became a Ransomware Powerhouse,” NYT: “[The] rapidly expanding criminal industry based primarily in Russia that has morphed from a specialty demanding highly sophisticated hacking skills into a conveyor-belt-like process. Now, even small-time criminal syndicates and hackers with mediocre computer capabilities can pose a potential national security threat. … “DarkSide offers what is known as ‘ransomware as a service,’ in which a malware developer charges a user fee to so-called affiliates … who may not have the technical skills to actually create ransomware but are still capable of breaking into a victim’s computer systems. DarkSide’s services include providing technical support for hackers, negotiating with targets like the publishing company, processing payments, and devising tailored pressure campaigns through blackmail and other means, such as secondary hacks to crash websites. … “In many ways, the organizational structure of the Russian ransomware industry mimics franchises, like McDonald’s or Hertz, that lower barriers to entry and allow for easy duplication of proven business practices and techniques. Access to DarkSide’s dashboard was all that was needed to set up shop as an affiliate of DarkSide and, if desired, download a working version of the ransomware used in the attack on Colonial Pipeline.” IRAN WATCH — “U.S. monitoring Iranian warships that may be headed to Venezuela,” by Betsy Woodruff Swan, Lara Seligman, Andrew Desiderio and Nahal Toosi: “The U.S. national security community is monitoring two Iranian naval vessels whose ultimate destination may be Venezuela, in what would be a provocative move at a tense moment in U.S.-Iran relations. “An Iranian frigate and the Makran, a former oil tanker that was converted to a floating forward staging base, have been heading south along the east coast of Africa, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. U.S. officials do not know for sure the destination of the Iranian ships, these officials said, but believe they may be ultimately headed for Venezuela. Iran’s intent in sending the vessels in the direction of the Western Hemisphere remains a mystery, the people said, as does their cargo.” BORIS KEPT IT HUSH-HUSH — “Boris Johnson Married in Stealth Ceremony, Reports Say,” by NYT’s Mark Lander: “Only a week ago, Prime Minister BORIS JOHNSON of Britain and his fiancée, CARRIE SYMONDS, sent friends save-the-date cards for a wedding in July 2022, according to several British newspapers. But on Saturday, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Symonds were married in a stealth ceremony at Westminster Cathedral in London, according to two tabloids, The Mail on Sunday and The Sun. It was a characteristically dramatic twist for a relationship that had unfolded in a frenetic way from the very start.” BEYOND THE BELTWAY BREAKING OVERNIGHT — “2 killed, more than 20 wounded in mass shooting at rap concert, Miami-Dade police say,” Miami Herald ILLINOIS MEETS THE NEW BOSS — “With Madigan gone, Democrats roll Republicans in Springfield to keep control, reward allies,” Chicago Tribune: “Illinois Democrats are turning the spring session into a partisan tour de force. … For Republicans who looked at the January departure of MICHAEL MADIGAN — the embattled state Democratic Party chair and the nation’s longest-serving House speaker — as an opportunity for a fresh start, the session has been a rude awakening. … “With the General Assembly scheduled to adjourn Monday, top Democratic priorities are steadily advancing. On Friday, lawmakers sent Democratic Gov. J.B. PRITZKER legislation to redraw Illinois’ legislative districts to the party’s favor for the next decade and redo state Supreme Court boundaries for the first time in nearly 60 years to try to keep their majority. … Meanwhile, Republicans largely have been shut out of negotiations over a new state budget and how to spend federal pandemic relief funds. They also have been unsuccessful in pushing stronger ethics proposals.” JAN. 6 AND ITS AFTERMATH THE RESULT OF NOT INVESTIGATING FURTHER — “As G.O.P. Blocks Inquiry, Questions on Jan. 6 Attack May Go Unanswered,” by NYT’s Luke Broadwater: “The public may never know precisely what Mr. Trump and members of his administration did or said as a throng of his supporters stormed the Capitol while Congress met to formalize President Biden’s victory, threatening the lives of lawmakers and the vice president. The full story may never be revealed of why security officials were so unprepared for the breach of the building, supposedly one of the most secure in the nation, despite ample warnings of potential violence. The extent of the role of Republican lawmakers closely allied with Mr. Trump in planning the Jan. 6 ‘Stop the Steal’ rally that spiraled into a brutal onslaught may remain unexplored.” THE ‘MISINFO’ DEFENSE — “Defense for some Capitol rioters: election misinformation,” by AP’s David Klepper: “Lawyers for at least three defendants charged in connection with the violent siege tell The Associated Press that they will blame election misinformation and conspiracy theories, much of it pushed by then-President Donald Trump, for misleading their clients. The attorneys say those who spread that misinformation bear as much responsibility for the violence as do those who participated in the actual breach of the Capitol. “‘I kind of sound like an idiot now saying it, but my faith was in him,’ defendant ANTHONY ANTONIO said, speaking of Trump. Antonio said he wasn’t interested in politics before pandemic boredom led him to conservative cable news and right-wing social media. ‘I think they did a great job of convincing people.’” TOP-EDS — NYT’s Maureen Dowd talks policing with former NYPD and LAPD chief Bill Bratton, who says he’s never seen police morale so low, and that Derek Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd “set policing back in the sense of public confidence, trust, race relations — set it all back 20, 30 years … [or] maybe further than that, back to when I started in 1970.” — WaPo’s Megan McArdle on what the “lab leak” theory shows us about “expert consensus”: “[T]he form this belief in science took was often positively anti-scientific. Instead of a group of constantly evolving theories that might be altered at any time, or falsified entirely, and is thus always open to debate, ‘science’ was a demand that others subordinate their judgment to an elite-approved group of credentialed scientific experts. … Obviously we should listen to experts, because they know more than we do. Just maybe not so much more that we should treat their pronouncements as having dropped from heaven on stone tablets.” — Miami Herald’s Leonard Pitts Jr. with a poignant piece ahead of Memorial Day, remembering a troubled Vietnam veteran named Greg: “On Memorial Day, we honor those who sacrificed their lives in America’s wars. This year, though, I’ll also be thinking of Greg and all those like him, keeping unwilling company with demons of sorrow and despair.” INTERESTING TWITTER THREADS — 15 tweets that demonstrate just how bizarre the U.S. housing market has become, by Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman — The overlooked proliferation of opioids in hip-hop, by KHN’s Chaseedaw Giles — You probably didn’t realize this, but a “country,” a “nation” and a “state” aren’t quite the same thing, by UChicago’s Paul Poast — A glimpse at yet another new Covid strain driving a new wave of infections in the U.K., by FT’s John Burn-Murdoch SUBSCRIBE TO ""THE RECAST"" TODAY: Power is shifting in Washington and in communities across the country.

News By Mark Lungariello Submit May 30, 2021 | 8:55pm				| Updated May 30, 2021 | 8:55pm A social media post that threatened the mass shooting of minorities in southern California on Sunday turned out to be fake, local police said. A Reddit post using the name of a Lakewood man promised gun violence but the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department found the threat wasn’t credible. “The Lakewood resident cooperated fully with Sheriff’s Dept investigators, and investigators now believe that the resident was the victim of what is known as ‘swatting,’ ” a statement on the Lakewood Twitter account said. Swatting includes fake 911 calls or communications reporting a crime in progress “with the intent of creating hysteria and a large-scale law enforcement response,” the statement read. “The Sheriff’s Department does not believe that the social media posting this morning related to potential violence is a credible threat,” the statement continued. “The Sheriff’s Department will be investigating further to determine who was behind the false post.” The original Reddit post appears to have been deleted, but screenshots of the post showed a man promising to leave a 192-page manifesto “rationalizing and explaining” his hate toward minorities. The author claimed to be a longtime resident who had been bullied and threatened to use an AR-15 and Glock 18 to shoot “every minority in sight.” “I am aiming for at least 10, but the more the better,” the post said. The post also threatened members of the City Council, according to screenshots posted to social media. Read Next Mother accused of forcing adopted daughter into surgery, t...

News By Gabrielle Fonrouge Submit May 30, 2021 | 11:59pm				| Updated May 31, 2021 | 9:28am  An apparent neo-Nazi in Texas has been arrested for planning a mass shooting at a Walmart, police said Sunday. Coleman Thomas Blevins, 28, was arrested Friday in Kerrville, about 70 miles northwest of San Antonio, after investigators intercepted a message indicating he planned to carry out a mass shooting with a specific threat that included Walmart, the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office announced in a Facebook post. Investigators from the sheriff’s office made contact with Blevins and confirmed “his affiliation and networking with extremist ideologies” and determined he was capable of “following through with the threat” so they “moved immediately to arrest him,” cops said. The sheriff’s office posted an image of Blevins and evidence they found after a search warrant of his home. Items found in Blevins’ home included flags depicting the swastika and other Nazi symbols and extremist books like “The Turner Diaries,” which was written by the leader of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, according to the Anti-Defamation League. “Firearms, ammunition, electronic evidence, concentrated THC, and radical ideology paraphernalia, including books, flags, and handwritten documents” were also seized, cops said. Blevins is currently on felony probation and is prohibited from possessing firearms, police said. He was booked into the Kerr County Jail on a warrant for a terroristic threat to create public fear of serious bodily injury and is being held on a $250,000 bond, cops said. The week-long probe included the sheriff’s office’s Special Operations Division, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the FBI and the US Secret Service. “This case reminds us that we need to always be vigilant. Many think ‘that can’t happen here’, and it was well on the way to happening,” Sheriff Larry Leitha said in a statement. “Our investigators did outstanding work in this case, and possibly saved many lives. The plot interrupted in this case is unthinkable,” Leitha went on. “We’d like to remind the public, if you see something, say something.” Read Next Customers freak out over HBO problems during 'Mare of East...

378,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kv8ma/vietnamese-rush-limbaugh-youtube,"Streaming live from his Virginia Studio, YouTuber Nguy Vu has shoulder-length black hair and wears tinted dark-rimmed glasses. During a recent appearance, he pulled an image of anti-Asian hate crime protesters up on the screen. “Why don’t they protest today when they killed ten white people?” Vu said in Vietnamese, referring to the Boulder King Soopers mass shooting in March. “This is all just propaganda for the Democrats!” A former radio host, Nguy Vu — AKA Kingradio — has been in the YouTube game since 2019. In an email exchange with VICE World News, Vu said his fans like to call him a Vietnamese Rush Limbaugh, after the late shock jock radio host that pioneered right-wing internet rhetoric. But with his booming and theatrical voice, penchant for conspiracy theories, and ads for own-brand miracle cream, Vu is perhaps more of a Vietnamese Alex Jones. Though hardly as well-known as the far-right conspiracy theorist, Vu is a big name among Vietnamese American Republicans, the only major Asian ethnic group that had a net favorability rating for Donald Trump in the 2020 elections, according to the Asian American Voter Survey. Over email, Vu was friendly and polite, far removed from the pantomime villain he plays online. He explained that, as a Vietnamese refugee who came to America by boat and fled a Communist regime, he wanted to show the world what a craving for freedom looked like. Since arriving in the U.S., Vu has tried his hand at being a musician, a writer, and, for the last 25 years, a radio host, having worked for Little Saigon Radio in California before striking out alone in Virginia. But none of these careers landed the following that Vu has now found online. Since firing up his YouTube channel, Vu’s become notorious among first- and second-generation Vietnamese Americans, who watch with concern as their parents consume videos containing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Videos that were removed by Vu after receiving strikes on his YouTube channel were reuploaded by one Vietnamese misinformation researcher to show the damaging impact of Vu’s rhetoric. They show theories like Mel Gibson exposing an underground Hollywood pedophile ring, and Bill Gates creating a COVID-19 vaccine to control the U.S. and, eventually, the world. When one of his critics, Nguyen Nhu Quynh, denounced Vu online for spreading misinformation, he called for his followers to “take pestle and beat her buck teeth.” When asked about the specific videos, Vu declined to comment on whether he promotes conspiracy theories, or whether he spreads misinformation. He said that he didn’t remember promoting violence against Nguyen, either, but added, “My job is reporting news and removing parasite people like her.” With almost 100,000 subscribers, each of his hour-long streams can rake in tens of thousands of views, but his following doesn’t stop there. Vu has organised pro-Trump rallies, where he encourages his aging followers to remove their masks or, like a naughty school kid, be left on the bus. Vu’s rallies crescendoed on January 5th, the day before the Capitol riots, when he rallied fans with a bull horn on what was called, “King team Trump day 9”. Though his followers were seen with Jake Angeli, the “QAnon Shaman”, at the Capitol, Vu claimed that he was not in DC on the day of the riot. The last few years have seen an increase in the ageing Vietnamese diaspora turning to YouTube, Facebook and messaging apps to get their news, as mainstream U.S. media outlets don’t align with their political leanings or broadcast in their first language. Republican Facebook pages in Vietnamese, like TIN NÓNG HOA KỲ (US Hot News) and Những Người Yêu Mến Donald J.Trump (Lovers of Donald J. Trump) can pull in tens of thousands of fans. Though traffic declined when Trump lost the election, with some listeners likely tired of the same old material, hosts simply shifted their rhetoric to face masks and COVID-19. Then, they took on anti-Asian hate crimes. In late March, shortly after the Atlanta shooting that killed eight people — six of whom were women of Asian descent — Vu began to pepper his theories with a suggestion that the trend was cooked up by Democrats. Though anti-Asian bigotry has long been a fact of life in the U.S., researchers and advocates say the COVID-19 pandemic, along with former president Trump’s “Chinese virus” and “kung flu” remarks, fueled an increase in targeted hate crimes by around 150% in the last year. Stop AAPI Hate, an organisation that monitors hate crime against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, released a report in early May showing 3,000 reports of violence against the AAPI community in March 2021 alone – 8.8% of which were aimed at Vietnamese American citizens. AAPI reports range from racial slurs, to physical assaults and hate speech online. More recent attacks that occurred after the release of the report include two Asian women, one 63 and the other 84, who were stabbed in early May while waiting for a bus, and four attacks on Asian people in New York, one of which involved a hammer. But denial of anti-Asian bigotry within Vu’s videos didn’t come as a shock to his critics either. For a long time, Boomer influencers like Vu have been sending QAnon-like conspiracies out into cyberspace for older Vietnamese Americans to consume. To combat the rhetoric of Vu and his peers, younger Vietnamese Americans have taken up the mantle to protect their elders from misinformation. In the last two years, various organisations and independent monitors have sprang up to inform listeners and remove videos by reporting them to YouTube, though this has yielded mixed results. One of these independent monitors, Nick Nguyen, a research lead of Viet Fact Check, managed to see the removal of Vu’s video questioning anti-Asian violence after an email to YouTube, though he hasn’t had much luck since. Another monitor who goes by Fake News Cops online, but preferred to be identified simply as “Peter” for fear of possible retribution from far-right groups, helped to find and translate many of the YouTube monologues that appear in this story. Peter has been flagging Vietnamese-language videos to YouTube for months, but said his attempts to see the removal of videos have also been hit and miss. But it’s not just independent organisations and online vigilantes grappling with this issue. Rachel Moran and Sarah Nguyen at the Information School and University of Washington started looking into the spread of misinformation from Vietnamese American groups earlier in the year, following the presidential election. They noticed that, while extensive research had been made into misinformation in English, little effort had gone into understanding how misinformation proliferates in various diaspora communities. Nguyen started to monitor communities on Telegram and WhatsApp. Here, she noticed a similar rhetoric applied to the Stop Asian Hate protests that mirrored the language used in the Black Lives Matter protests a year earlier. “It’s the same memes and the same videos reshared again and again,” Nguyen said. YouTube’s attempts to counter misinformation led the company to introduce “information panels”, which will pop up when searching for, or watching videos related to topics that are prone to misinformation, like COVID-19 and the moon landing. These provide information from independent, third-party partners in an attempt to give a more rounded understanding to the subject. But critics say that these panels, which are either in English or Spanish, prove to be of little value to communities that speak other languages. YouTube claimed that its approach to addressing misinformation is global, and applies across all languages. “We remove content that violates our Community Guidelines, raise authoritative content, and reduce recommendations of borderline content in every market we operate. When it comes to violative videos, YouTube has more than 20,000 people around the world, including those with Vietnamese and non-English language expertise, working to detect, review and remove content that violates our policies,” said YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez over email. This has, to an extent, worked. According to YouTube, Vu has received two strikes against his channel, and a third would lead to a permanent ban. But Nick Nguyen, the research lead of Viet Fact Check, thinks more needs to be done to acknowledge misinformation in languages other than English. After all, this is an issue playing out in some cases within a half-hour drive of YouTube’s offices, at his home in Palo Alto, or in San Jose, with the largest population of Vietnamese Americans in the country. “They just have no excuses,” said Nick Nguyen. “This is just one more example of discrimination against non-English speakers in the U.S.” “This is just one more example of discrimination against non-English speakers in the U.S.” In his exchanges with VICE World News, Vu appeared to backpedal on some of his remarks and said he is no longer so quick to deny the attacks on Asian-Americans. “I think the crimes on Asians are really bad and I condemn those crimes,” Vu said, before adding several caveats. “But many people use those for different purposes, calling for fraud donations and many other frauds that use Asian hate as a purpose.” Vu continued to explain his hot take on the situation. He said that the Asian community is blessed to live in this “free country”; that these crimes are between individuals, not an entire community, and that, though “random” may not be the right word for the situation, he believed it was something in that ballpark. “In the end, I don’t want to take sides,” said Vu. “My audience knows and appreciates that I help them to understand what is happening in this country.” Follow Ashley Lampard on Twitter.

That figure is up from $310,000 on Wednesday. California Highway Patrol officers continued searching across Southern California for a man suspected of opening fire from the passenger seat of a white Volkswagen Golf SportWagen on the 55 Freeway, resulting in the death of young Aiden Leos on Friday, May 21. The 6-year-old was in a booster seat as his mother drove on the freeway. No suspects were publicly named over the weekend, despite the reward offered for clues and direct appeals from officials to the shooter, or anyone who knows him, to come forward. It’s believed a woman was driving the Volkswagen, officials have also urged her to come forward. Anyone with information about the suspect or the involved vehicle was asked to contact the CHP’s Santa Ana office at 714 567-6000 or email santaanachptipline@chp.ca.gov “The longer this goes… the less sympathy I’ll have,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said Sunday, May 30, in a statement addressed to the suspect posted on social media. “You killed a 6-year-old boy for God’s sake. Come forward. Turn yourself in.” The CHP released a photo of the Volkswagen possibly involved in the shooting on Thursday. The image has been plastered across broadcast, print and social media as investigators expand their investigation to encompass all of Southern California. Over the weekend, the owner of a private company added an additional $65,000 to a growing reward funded by civic leaders, local businesses and individuals outraged by Leos’s death. That contribution brought the amount offered in hopes of identifying a suspect up to $400,000 as of Sunday evening, District Attorney’s officials said.

One of the victims fatally wounded at a mass shooting in Northwest Miami-Dade has been identified as Clayton Dillard III. Twenty-two people were injured, two fatally, in Sunday’s morning’s shooting, which, according to reports, began after three people stepped out of a white Nissan Pathfinder in front of El Mula Banquet Hall after midnight and fired assault rifles and handguns into a crowd. The venue had been rented out for a concert that night. Victims of the shooting were transported to various hospitals in the region. Dillard and one other person were pronounced dead at the scene. Dillard’s father told a local news outlet that he begged to see his son’s body on Sunday, but it remained covered by a tarp at the active crime scene. A report says the young man’s body remained in 90-degree heat for nearly 18 hours.

Coleman Thomas Blevins, 28, was arrested Friday for a terroristic threat to create public fear of serious bodily injury, according to the Kerr County Sheriffs Office. Law enforcement, including local police and the FBI, investigated Blevins for a week to confirm his association with extremist ideologies. “This case reminds us that we need to always be vigilant. Many think ‘that can’t happen here,’ and it was well on the way to happening,” Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said in a statement. “Our investigators did outstanding work in this case, and possibly saved many lives. The plot interrupted in this case is unthinkable.”  Officials obtained information that Blevins was preparing to conduct a mass shooting and made plans for his arrest, according to the Kerr County Sheriffs Office. While executing a search warrant of his home following his arrest, officials seized firearms, ammunition, concentrated THC, and radical ideology paraphernalia including books, flags and handwritten documents. Blevins was on active felony probation at the time of the arrest and prohibited from owning firearms, according to the Kerr County Sheriffs Office. (RELATED: Neo-Nazi Sentenced To Nearly 20 Years In Prison For Plot To Blow Up Synagogue) Blevins was taken to the Kerr County Jail on a $250,000 bond, according to the Kerr County Sheriffs Office.

          / CBS/AP Authorities called on the public to help identify gunmen who indiscriminately sprayed bullets into crowds at two Miami-area venues over the weekend, killing a total of three people. Two people died and over 20 others were wounded early Sunday during a shooting outside a concert in Miami-Dade County, about a day after a drive-by shooting killed one person and injured six in Miami's Wynwood arts district. In northwest Miami-Dade County, police said three hooded men armed with assault rifles and handguns jumped out of a white Nissan Pathfinder and opened fire, CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez reports. Police on Monday said investigators believe the shooting was the result of an ongoing rivalry between two groups. Clayton Dillard III, 26, was one of two people pronounced dead at the scene, CBS News correspondent Meg Oliver reports. His father became overwhelmed with grief during a police press conference Monday. ""You all killed my kid,"" the man said. ""You must burn."" The Pathfinder was found dumped in a canal on Monday, CBS Miami reports. The vehicle had been reported stolen about two weeks prior to the shooting, according to CBS Miami. Hours before the vehicle was found, police released a snippet from surveillance video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at the strip mall housing the El Mula Banquet Hall, which had been rented out for the concert. The video shows three people getting out of the vehicle. They return moments later and drive off into the darkness. Police said some in the crowd returned fire. *RELEASE OF VIDEO SURVEILLANCE* We are releasing video footage of the vehicle/subjects involved in the shooting that occurred in Northwest Miami-Dade on 5/30/21 that left two deceased and 21 others injured. Anyone with information is URGED to contact @CrimeStopper305 immediately. pic.twitter.com/X2jlxYFrEL ""This type of gun violence has to stop. Every weekend it's the same thing,"" said the police director of Miami-Dade County, Alfredo ""Freddy"" Ramirez III, whose officers were hunting down the suspects in Sunday's shooting that took place shortly after midnight. ""These are cold blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice,"" Ramirez said in a tweet. Two people died at the scene, police said. Over 20 people went to various hospitals for treatment with three in critical condition. Businessman and TV personality Marcus Lemonis, star of ""The Profit,"" took to Twitter to offer a $100,000 reward to help authorities capture the suspects. Other rewards raised the total to $130,000. Angelica Green said her son was shot in the abdomen, but he's now in an ICU trauma unit in stable condition. ""He called us frantic, telling us he had been shot, that it hurts, it hurts and he loves us,"" Green said. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis joined in mourning, tweeting that he was ""praying for the recovery"" of the victims and pledged help from state authorities. ""We are working with local authorities to bring justice to the perpetrators. Justice needs to be swift & severe!"" DeSantis tweeted. Sunday's shooting came a little over a day after a drive-by shooting claimed the life of one person outside another venue about 13 miles away in Miami. Six others were injured. Some witnesses likened the scene to a ""war zone"" after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying in the night. On CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Miami Police Chief Art Acevedo expressed his frustration over America's persistent gun violence, urging lawmakers to take action. ""Without legislation, without certainty as it relates to holding these criminals accountable, we're never going to get through the summer,"" Acevedo said. Democratic state Senator Shevrin Jones said he wants DeSantis to do more than just pray. He's calling on the governor to sit down with Democrats to discuss meaningful ways of addressing gun violence. ""Thoughts and prayers have been going on for years and thoughts and prayers haven't done a damn thing inside the Black community — or any community when it comes to gun violence,"" Jones said. But he acknowledged Republicans are resistant to discuss the issue. ""Republicans don't want to talk about guns. They think we're trying to take their guns away from them. If their talking point is that guns are for protection, or that guns are for hunting, just know that that terminology is different in certain communities,"" Jones said. ""Some of these individuals are using guns to murder. Some of these individuals are using guns to hunt people."" First published on May 31, 2021 / 11:15 AM © 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

Twenty-three people were shot, including two fatally, early Sunday morning at the El Mula Banquet Hall in Hialeah, Florida, where a local rapper was celebrating his birthday. The father of one victim interrupted Monday's news conference. Clayton Dillard could be heard shouting ""killed my kid"" and ""killed my son!"" As the grieving father was escorted away, Miami-Dade Police Director Freddy Ramirez told reporters, ""That's the pain that affects our community right there."" Police said they believe the shooting -- carried out by three gunmen -- was motivated by an ""ongoing rivalry"" between two groups. The gunmen waited outside of the banquet hall for about 40 minutes and then opened fire on patrons as they left, Ramirez told ABC News on Sunday. Some patrons returned fire, Ramirez said, and over 100 shell casings were found at the scene. At Monday's news conference, Miami-Dade County Commissioner Keon Hardemon called the shooting an act of domestic terrorism. Police released surveillance video of the gunmen exiting a white Nissan Pathfinder at the scene. On Monday evening police said the car -- which was reported stolen on May 15 -- had been found, submerged in a canal. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava vowed to ""use every resource available to bring these people to justice."" Three survivors remain in critical condition, police said Monday. The mayor also addressed gun violence more broadly, noting that over 30 people were shot this weekend. ""We must break the cycle of violence,"" she said.

The transit agency announced in a Sunday tweet that “VTA light rail service is suspended until further notice,” and that because of staffing limits, they will discontinue the substitute bus bridges that had been mimicking the three main light-rail lines that connect the South Bay from Mountain View to Los Gatos and East and South San Jose. Instead, starting Tuesday, VTA is directing riders to plan to travel through existing bus routes. That means riders should not be heading to light-rail stations if a closer bus route serves their location. Anyone looking for further information about VTA service changes can call 408-321-2300 or go online to vta.org. Monday, Evelynn Tran, interim VTA general manager and general counsel, elaborated on the decision in a blog post on the VTA website. “For the immediate future, the light rail system is shut down. At this point, it is impossible to estimate when service can be restored,” Tran wrote. “There are many factors involved in restoring service, most importantly the human factor.” Our people are our first priority.

I cannot adequately express how deeply impressed and proud I am of all our VTA people. The courage they’ve shown during this tragedy is incredible.” Tran added: “Now, our primary focus is the well-being and health of our people. I have directed staff to make our people our first priority. We will marshal all the resources we can to assist our people through this. It will mean providing less service to the community than we would wish. But healing our organization must be our first priority.” Light-rail service was initially suspended a few hours after the Wednesday morning shootings at the Guadalupe Yard on West Younger Avenue, as the transit system was getting up and running for the day. Samuel James Cassidy, 57, described as a disgruntled VTA substation maintenance employee who was shown to harbor violent feelings toward his employer and whose family suggested he suffered from untreated mental illness — including bipolar disorder — had three handguns and more than 300 rounds of ammunition when he began methodically shooting people and making his way through the Guadalupe facility. By the end, it would go down as the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. The victims were Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63; Adrian Balleza, 29; Alex Ward Fritch, 49; Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, 35; Lars Kepler Lane, 63; Paul Delacruz Megia, 42; Timothy Michael Romo, 49; Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40; and Taptej Singh, 36.

Three men have been charged in a scheme to traffic stolen guns from Florida to Connecticut. Eric Woodie, 30, and Julian Judge, 22, both of New Britain, Connecticut, as well as Dominic Colon-Brown, 27, of Farmington, Connecticut, are each charged with conspiring to engage in the business of dealing in firearms without a license and to transport stolen firearms in interstate commerce. Colon-Brown and Judge were arrested Thursday on criminal complaints and appeared via videoconference before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas O. Farrish. Both are detained pending detention hearings scheduled for June 1. Woodie had been detained in state custody since March. MIAMI POLICE CHIEF CALLS FOR ‘SERIOUS PRISON TIME’ FOR ILLEGAL GUN POSSESSION AFTER LATEST MASS SHOOTING In late February, Woodie allegedly rented a car, which Judge and Colon-Brown used to drive to Florida to obtain stolen firearms and bring the firearms back to Connecticut, according to court documents and statements made in court. On March 8, law enforcement recovered a .40 caliber handgun and a high-capacity magazine that Woodie discarded during a foot chase in New Britain. A subsequent search of a New Britain apartment where Woodie and Judge resided revealed three additional loaded firearms, two extended magazines, more than 100 rounds of ammunition and approximately 60 grams of cocaine, according to federal prosecutors. The serial number on one of the firearms found in the apartment matched the serial number of a firearm that had been stolen in Florida in February, Leonard C. Boyle, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, and David Sundberg﻿, special agent in charge of the FBI's New Haven division, said Friday in announcing the charges against the three men. Recorded conversations allegedly captured Woodie, Colon-Brown and Judge discussing the illegal acquisition and sale of firearms. Federal prosecutors also say Judge and Colon-Brown posted photos of themselves on social media in possession of firearms. Transporting stolen firearms in interstate commerce is an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years, federal prosecutors say. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI’s Northern Connecticut Gang Task Force, New Britain Police Department, Farmington Police Department, West Hartford Police Department and Pasco County, Florida Sheriff’s Office.

397,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/us-gun-sales-rise-pandemic,"First-time buyers make up more than one-fifth of Americans who purchased guns amid huge number of firearms already circulating Last modified on Tue 1 Jun 2021 13.47 BST Gun sales, which spiked sharply during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, have continued to increase in the United States, with first-time buyers making up more than one-fifth of Americans who purchased guns. The development will frustrate and disappoint gun control advocates who point out the huge number of firearms already circulating in American society as well as a seemingly never-ending cycle of mass shootings.  A study by the General Social Survey, a public opinion poll conducted by a research center at the University of Chicago, 39% of American households own guns, up from 32% in 2016. Separately, research data compiled by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), background checks that topped 1m a week in March 2020 – the highest since the government began tracking them in 1998 – and continued, with one week in April this year recording a record 1.2m checks. Background checks are seen as a reliable metric to track gun sales. A third data study, compiled by Northeastern University and the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and seen by the New York Times, shows that 6.5% of US adults, or 17 million people, have purchased guns in the past year, up from 5.3% in 2019. Of those, almost one-fifth who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners of whom half were women, a fifth were Black and a fifth were Hispanic, challenging the stereotype of white male gun owners building personal arsenals. In 2021, gun owners overall were 63% male, 73% were white, 10% were Black and 12% Hispanic. Separately, The Trace, a non-partisan group that tracks guns sales, estimates 2.3m guns were purchased in January alone. Sales, which had remained largely flat for the duration of the Trump presidency, jumped 64% in 2020, the group said. Still, the increases are relatively small compared to the 400m guns estimated to already be in circulation, including at least 4m AR-15s, commonly described as assault rifles. “Americans are in an arms race with themselves,” South Los Angeles city council representative Marqueece Harris-Dawson told the New York Times. “There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic.” Increased gun sales comes as Texas this month became the 20th state to pass legislation that no longer requires a permit to carry a concealed handgun. At the same time, a rash of mass shootings, often involving AR-15 weapons have dominated headlines. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 67 mass shootings have taken place in May this year. The most recent occurred on Sunday when a gunman opened fire in Miami, killing two people and injuring 20 others. Authorities in Texas said on Monday they had arrested a man accused of plotting to carry out a mass shooting at a Walmart, and a search of the suspect’s home turned up firearms, ammunition and materials officials described as “radical ideology paraphernalia”. Still, researchers are wary of connecting increased gun ownership with gun violence. The FBI reported a 25% rise in homicides last year that has continued into this with an 18% increase over the first three months of 2021 across 37 cities, including rises of 36% in Los Angeles and 23% in New York. But criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri told the New York Times that the focus on gun numbers is misplaced. “The critical issue is not simply the increase in the supply of guns but in the nature of the weaponry that’s being used in violent crime, and that has really changed,” he said.",2021-05-31 11:23:17,US gun sales spiked during pandemic and continue to rise,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

News By Ben Feuerherd Submit May 31, 2021 | 12:25pm				| Updated May 31, 2021 | 1:02pm Surveillance video released by cops Monday shows three suspected gunmen hop out of a white SUV, carrying rifles and a handgun, seconds before they opened fire at a crowd outside a concert, killing two people and wounding 21 others. The trio of gunmen, wearing masks and hoods, emerge from the front passenger-side door, as well as the back seat, and run toward the crowd, the footage shows. Two of the shooters were carrying long guns while the third had a handgun, according to the footage. Seconds later, the three suspects scramble back to the waiting SUV, which then speeds off and turns the corner, disappearing from view of the surveillance camera, the footage shows. The gunmen targeted the crowd at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County as people gathered for a rap concert at the venue soon after midnight Sunday, police said. Two people were killed and more than 20 were injured as the trio of shooters sprayed the crowd with bullets. Miami-Dade Police Department Director Alfredo “Freddy” Ramirez III said the gunmen appeared to fire randomly into the crowd — but they had targeted the venue. “These are cold-blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice. My deepest condolences to the family of the victims,” he told CBS. The chief of police of the Miami Police Department, Art Acevedo, added that the shooting is part of a “scourge” of gun violence across America. “It’s just an indication of the problem we have with the scourge of gun violence in this country, that we have to do much more at the federal level to stop,” Acevedo said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Read Next Police trying to ID young boy found dead in Nevada on moun...

Monday, 31 May 2021 12:31 PM Fox News political analyst Juan Williams wrote on Monday that ""extremism among Republicans is paralyzing Congress,"" and ""poisoning the nation,"" in an opinion piece published by The Hill. ""More and more fights breaking out on airplanes. Why? The short answer is that wearing masks to protect against COVID-19 remains a politically divisive statement,"" wrote Williams, who recently stepped down as co-host of Fox News' ""The Five,"" but remains on the network as an analyst. ""Nine killed by gunfire in another mass shooting. Hateful attacks on Jews and Asians rising. All of that happened in the last week,"" he continued, noting that ""Americans should be coming together in celebration of declining coronavirus infections this Memorial Day,"" but ""Instead, the bursts of public violence and hate reflect deep political division."" Williams then references a recent Fox News poll that shows 64% of American voters now ""see political divisions as a major threat to the ‘stability’ of the nation,"" making it the top threat to the nation in the eyes of voters. He also notes that more than half of Republicans said in a recent CBS/YouGov poll that Democrats are their ""enemies,"" and a recent Ipsos/Reuters survey found that most members of the GOP think that ""former President Donald Trump is the ‘true president,’ and 56% believe the 2020 election was stolen from him."" Williams asks, ""How can so many Republicans still believe the ‘Big Lie,’ almost five months after President Biden was inaugurated following Congress certifying Biden’s national victory by 74 electoral college votes and more than seven million popular votes?"" He writes, ""This extremism among Republicans is paralyzing Congress. It can’t find the votes to better regulate guns. It can’t fix a broken immigration system. Similarly, Republicans can’t compromise enough to reach a bipartisan deal to repair the nation’s decrepit infrastructure. Incredibly, Congress can’t even agree on a bill to protect the right to vote. ""Last week, Congress hit a new low. It blocked a commission to investigate the attempted overthrow of the U.S. government. Now that is dysfunction."" Williams goes on to wonder, ""What are the Republicans so afraid of?"" and ""Why did Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Ky., ask his caucus for a ‘personal favor,’ according to CNN, to vote to stop creation of the commission?"" He adds, ""What Senate Republicans are really avoiding is the truth that Trump’s lies and slash-and-burn, truth-be-damned politics drove some of them to play along with him. They are implicated in the insurrection — not in a criminal sense, but in a moral sense.""  © 2021 Newsmax. All rights reserved. Newsmax, Moneynews, Newsmax Health, and Independent.

The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative looked at the 1,300 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2019, and found that just 44 had an Asian or Pacific Islander lead or co-lead. And in the films that did have an AAPI lead, there was about a one in three chance that it was Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Not only that: Just six of the movies had an AAPI woman in a leading role, and not a single one of those women was 40 years old or older. Nearly 40% of the films had zero AAPI characters, and 59% had no female AAPI characters. And when Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are represented, it … can be bad. “Despite the more visibility of Asians in popular consciousness in popular culture, they are still not just quantitatively underrepresented, but they are qualitatively tokenized, isolated, and stereotyped, unfortunately, and they're still not as complex as they could be,” report co-author Nancy Wang Yuen told USA Today. One way that plays out is in the hypersexualization of women and the emasculation of men. This is particularly relevant in the wake of more than a year of high-profile demonization of Chinese people around the coronavirus pandemic, concurrent rising anti-Asian hate crimes, and the mass shooting at Atlanta-area spas in which six of eight people killed were women of Asian descent. Representation matters, and not to denigrate The Rock or anything, but the AAPI community is a little bit broader. We’re at the end of Asian Heritage Month. Maybe take a couple hours to look up a movie or television show that lets Asian characters and Asian actors speak.

Coleman Thomas Blevins, 28, of Kerrville, was arrested Friday “on a warrant for a terroristic threat to create public fear of serious bodily injury,” according to a statement by the Kerr County Sheriff’s Office. Several agencies, including the FBI, worked for a week to track the man who was thought to be “a threat to national security.” Investigators intercepted a message that indicated Blevins was planning a mass shooting and mentioned Walmart. They “confirmed his affiliation and networking with extremist ideologies” and determined he was capable of “following through with the threat” so they “moved immediately to arrest him,” according to the statement. He was booked into the Kerr County Jail in Kerrville, located around 65 miles northwest of San Antonio. When they arrested Blevins, authorities found weapons, ammunition and “radical ideology paraphernalia, including books, flags and handwritten documents” in his home. Although the release doesn’t specifically mention it, a photo posted by the sheriff’s office shows Blevins had flags depicting the swastika and other Nazi symbols. He also had extremist books, including The Turner Diaries, written by a neo-Nazi leader. Blevins is on probation and is forbidden from owning firearms. “Our investigators did outstanding work in this case, and possibly saved many lives.

The shooting stemmed from an ongoing rivalry between two different groups, Miami-Dade Homicide Bureau Maj. Jorge Aguiar said Monday. The intended target was believed to have been standing in front of the concert venue when the shooting began, he said. Police have not detailed the identities of the shooters or victims in what is one of the largest mass shootings in Miami-Dade County’s history. There have been 41 homicides in the county this year, as of May 23, the same amount as at this point in 2020, according to Miami-Dade Police Department data. [vemba-video id=”us/2021/05/31/florida-mass-shooting-miami-dade-surveillance-video-chen-vpx-nr.cnn”] Here’s what we know about the shooting: Shortly after midnight Sunday, a white Nissan Pathfinder pulled up to the El Mula Banquet Hall near Hialeah, police director Alfredo Ramirez III said. That’s when three people “stepped out of the vehicle with assault rifles and handguns and started firing indiscriminately into the crowd,” Ramirez said. Several others in the parking lot then armed themselves and opened fire toward the initial shooters, Aguiar said. The end result was an extensive crime scene with two dead and 21 others wounded, including three with critical injuries, according to a police statement. Surveillance video released by police shows the white vehicle come to a stop in an alley near the venue. Three armed people, all dressed in black, wearing face coverings and with their hoods over their heads, then exit the car and run off-screen. Less than 10 seconds later, the video shows them run back to the vehicle and hop in as the driver quickly leaves the scene. Ramirez said Sunday the shooting at the club was “targeted” and was “definitely not random.” The Pathfinder had been waiting in the parking lot for 20 to 40 minutes before the shooting, he said Monday. TV personality and Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the shooting, the businessman tweeted Sunday. In addition, Crime Stoppers Miami-Dade and the Keys and the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) added $30,000 to the reward, bringing it to $130,000.

The gunfire erupted early Sunday at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah, police told news outlets. (Devoun Cetourte/Miami Herald via AP)  All of the people injured in the shooting were identified as Black and ranged in age from 17 to 32, according to a police news release. The two people killed were both 26-year-old men, police said. Of the 21 people injured, three are in critical condition, three have been discharged and the rest remain hospitalized. Clayton Dillard III was one of the two people killed, several family members told CNN. Dillard, 26, had a 2-year-old son, according to his grandmother. She told CNN that family members had tried repeatedly to call Dillard on Sunday and tried to looked for him at area hospitals. Later that afternoon, several members of the extended family spent several hours at the shooting scene. His father, Clayton Dillard Jr., interrupted Monday’s news conference at Miami-Dade Police headquarters, shouting a message to those responsible: “You all killed my kid! You must burn!” Though Miami-Dade Police would not provide names, Aguiar confirmed that the man who interrupted the news conference is the father of one of the two deceased victims.

413,https://www.dailynews.com/2021/05/31/surveillance-video-shows-masked-suspects-who-police-say-opened-fire-outside-florida-banquet-hall/,"Trending: Miami-Dade Police released surveillance video that shows three masked suspects who they say opened fire at a crowd outside a concert venue in southern Florida on Sunday, leaving two people dead and 21 others wounded. The shooting stemmed from an ongoing rivalry between two different groups, Miami-Dade Homicide Bureau Maj. Jorge Aguiar said Monday. The intended target was believed to have been standing in front of the concert venue when the shooting began, he said. Police have not detailed the identities of the shooters or victims in what is one of the largest mass shootings in Miami-Dade County’s history. There have been 41 homicides in the county this year, as of May 23, the same amount as at this point in 2020, according to Miami-Dade Police Department data. [vemba-video id=”us/2021/05/31/florida-mass-shooting-miami-dade-surveillance-video-chen-vpx-nr.cnn”] Here’s what we know about the shooting: Shortly after midnight Sunday, a white Nissan Pathfinder pulled up to the El Mula Banquet Hall near Hialeah, police director Alfredo Ramirez III said. That’s when three people “stepped out of the vehicle with assault rifles and handguns and started firing indiscriminately into the crowd,” Ramirez said. Several others in the parking lot then armed themselves and opened fire toward the initial shooters, Aguiar said. The end result was an extensive crime scene with two dead and 21 others wounded, including three with critical injuries, according to a police statement. Surveillance video released by police shows the white vehicle come to a stop in an alley near the venue. Three armed people, all dressed in black, wearing face coverings and with their hoods over their heads, then exit the car and run off-screen. Less than 10 seconds later, the video shows them run back to the vehicle and hop in as the driver quickly leaves the scene. Ramirez said Sunday the shooting at the club was “targeted” and was “definitely not random.” The Pathfinder had been waiting in the parking lot for 20 to 40 minutes before the shooting, he said Monday. TV personality and Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the shooting, the businessman tweeted Sunday. In addition, Crime Stoppers Miami-Dade and the Keys and the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) added $30,000 to the reward, bringing it to $130,000.

The gunfire erupted early Sunday at the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah, police told news outlets. (Devoun Cetourte/Miami Herald via AP)  All of the people injured in the shooting were identified as Black and ranged in age from 17 to 32, according to a police news release. The two people killed were both 26-year-old men, police said. Of the 21 people injured, three are in critical condition, three have been discharged and the rest remain hospitalized. Clayton Dillard III was one of the two people killed, several family members told CNN. Dillard, 26, had a 2-year-old son, according to his grandmother. She told CNN that family members had tried repeatedly to call Dillard on Sunday and tried to looked for him at area hospitals. Later that afternoon, several members of the extended family spent several hours at the shooting scene. His father, Clayton Dillard Jr., interrupted Monday’s news conference at Miami-Dade Police headquarters, shouting a message to those responsible: “You all killed my kid! You must burn!” Though Miami-Dade Police would not provide names, Aguiar confirmed that the man who interrupted the news conference is the father of one of the two deceased victims. The banquet hall and billiards club had been rented out for a concert Saturday night, Ramirez said. A Facebook page for the establishment shows it hosts parties and happy hour events as well.

Monday, 31 May 2021 06:16 PM Miami police are offering $130,000 reward for information that could help them catch the suspects in the early morning Sunday shooting that left two dead and 21 injured, The Hill reported. Of the money, $100,000 is coming from businessman and TV personality Marcus Lemonis, star of CNBC's ""The Profit."" According to a tweet from Lemonis, his portion of the reward includes a conviction of the suspects. The manhunt continued Memorial Day for three masked suspects who opened fire early Sunday morning outside a Miami banquet hall, killing two men and wounding 21 others, in a shooting authorities said had spread terror and grief through their communities. Police released a snippet from surveillance video Monday that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at the strip mall housing the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade, near Hialeah. The video shows three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun, while the other two carried what police described as ""assault-style rifles."" That is when the gunmen sprayed bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, even though police said the assailants had specific targets in mind. Miami-Dade County PD Director Alfredo Ramirez III told the Miami Herald, the shooters waited between 20 and 40 minutes before attacking shortly after midnight. Police said some in the crowd returned fire. The video shows the three men returning moments later and driving off into the darkness. In all, 23 people were shot. In addition to the two fatalities, three others were in the hospital in critical condition. Because of privacy laws, police were not releasing the names of any of the victims. The SUV used in the shooting was later found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles east of the banquet hall. Police said the vehicle was reported stolen two weeks ago. Sunday's shooting came a little more than a day after a drive-by shooting claimed the life of one person outside another venue about 13 miles away in the Wynwood area. Six others were injured. Some witnesses likened the scene to a ""war zone,"" after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying in the night. ""This is a weekend, when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we're here mourning,"" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at Monday's press conference. ""These despicable shootings in Northwest Miami-Dade and in Wynwood are shameful acts of violence that have left innocent people dead and injured,"" Cava said. Police said the two shootings were unrelated. Police said Sunday's shooting appeared to stem from rivalries between two groups, but declined to refer to those groups as ""gangs.""

The handwringing over guns will predominate the discussion. Doing something about mental health and a treatment facility in Santa Clara County will get a yawn. There is no budget item to address the availability of guns because it isn’t a budget problem. There is no budget item for a mental health facility because our county supervisors, past and present, are not concerned enough. And it would cost money that isn’t there, or the focus is on pandering to some other “worthwhile” effort – “Opportunity Housing” as an example. We have mental health cases all over Santa Clara County. It is time to have a facility that can take them in or address their problems. Shame on us all for not speaking up. Allan MacLaren

His first words when President Obama was elected were that he was going to do everything he could to make Obama a one-term president. Thankfully, he failed. He did the same against Bill Clinton and will attempt to do the same with Biden. As far as I’m concerned, McConnell has been guilty of treason for the last 20 years.

Surveillance video shows masked gunmen entering Florida banquet hall before they open fire on crowd Miami-Dade police have found the vehicle used by three gunmen who killed two people and injured more than 20 others during an early Sunday gathering at a banquet hall submerged in a canal. The Miami-Dade Police Department said Monday that it recovered the Nissan Pathfinder in the area of 154th Street and Northwest Second Avenue. It was reported stolen May 15, police said. The SUV was found by police divers in Key Biscayne, located just east of Miami. Residents told WPLG-TV the area is a notorious dumping ground. Hours earlier, authorities released surveillance video of the SUV, which was stolen on May 15, police said. The brief video footage shows the gunmen getting out of the vehicle near the El Mula banquet hall with weapons and running back seconds later before peeling off. Fox News has reached out to the Miami-Dade Police Department. Investigators said the gunmen waited in their vehicle for 20 to 40 minutes for concertgoers to gather out front and that's when the gunmen ‘indiscriminately’ opened fire. Several people in the crowd who were armed returned fire, authorities said Monday. ""We will do everything, everything we can and use every resource available to bring these people to justice. We will leave no stone unturned, we will leave nothing behind to bring these shooters to justice,"" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a news conference. Two men, both 26, were killed, and 21 were injured. The Miami-Dade Police Department said 18 victims, including five women, remain hospitalized. No arrests have been made. Three other victims – a 31-year-old woman and two men, ages 21 and 25 -- remain in critical condition. Three people have been released from hospitals, including a 17-year-old who was shot in the leg. Authorities believe the shooting stemmed from a rivalry.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day New intel throws more credibility behind Wuhan lab theory as pressure on WHO ramps upBritish intelligence services are now reportedly reassessing their position on the theory that COVID-19 leaked from a lab in China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. A Sunday report from the Sunday Times of London quotes British spies who initially dismissed the lab leak theory, but now say it is ""feasible."" ""There might be pockets of evidence that take us one way, and evidence that takes us another way,"" the paper quoted a source as saying. ""The Chinese will lie either way. I don’t think we will ever know."" The quote comes as both the United States and Britain are stepping up calls for the World Health Organization to take a deeper look into the possible origins of COVID-19, including a new visit to China, where the first human infections were detected. WHO and Chinese experts issued a first report in March that laid out four hypotheses about how the pandemic might have emerged. The joint team said the most likely scenario was that the coronavirus jumped into people from bats via an intermediary animal, and the prospect that it erupted from a laboratory was deemed ""extremely unlikely."" The Biden administration wants to step up calls for China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to head off complaints from opposition Republican senators that the president has not been tough enough, as well as to use the opportunity to press China on alleged obstruction.

The paper said it is unclear why he was voted out and still has support from some parents and students. He told the graduates that he was kicked out because he loves the school and the community. ""I came here to serve you, to love you, to be in the mix and the grind with you,"" he said. He told the students that working at the school appealed to him after he saw a fight that took place there that made the news. He told students that he loved his job there and encouraged them to do their best. He also used the struggles in his own life as examples of perseverance. ""I wanted to tell the kids why I left, so they would know I did not leave them, I did not turn my back on them,"" he told the Record.

426,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653722984/0/phoenix/nation~Celebrate-with-pride-Visit-these-sites-where-LGBTQ-history-was-made/,"This nation celebrates Pride Month every June to mark the anniversary of New York’s Stonewall riots, a seminal moment in LGBTQ history. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic shifted celebrations to a virtual platform. But this year, as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and more Americans become vaccinated, some 2021 celebrations are back with a blend of virtual and in-person events. Megan Springate says notable LGBTQ heritage sites are found across the country: “LGBTQ history is American history. It’s in every community.” People can visit these sites any time of year, not just for Pride. Springate, a former National Park Service employee and now director of engagement at the America 250 Foundation. helped produce a study documenting hundreds of significant places and shared some favorites with USA TODAY. Shop Pride: 40 brands that are giving back for Pride Month 2021 Pride is back in 2021: Here's how to celebrate with parades, in-person and online events A turning point in LGBTQ rights came in 1969, when New York police raided the Stonewall Inn gay bar and sparked street protests in the surrounding Greenwich Village neighborhood. “Stonewall was a real watershed moment,” Springate says. Today, it’s a National Monument, and visitors can get their National Park Service Passport stamped at the original bar. nps.gov/ston This 19th century building hosted one of the modern world’s first same-sex weddings in 1975 after a defiant county clerk issued a marriage license to a gay couple. But local officials refused to recognize the union until 2016. “Ultimately, their marriage was affirmed, and the government eventually apologized,” Springate says. fusden.org Five years ago, the Pulse nightclub was the site of a mass shooting, considered the deadliest targeted murder in LGBTQ history, Springate says. Ultimately, the violence claimed 49 lives. The nightclub site now has an interim memorial, with plans to build a permanent monument and museum. onepulsefoundation.org In the years leading up to Stonewall, LGBTQ activists led protests in the historic district where the Declaration of Independence was signed. They held “annual reminder” July Fourth picketing demonstrations from 1965 to 1969 to publicize the inequalities they faced. “This was before Stonewall,” Springate says. After the Stonewall Uprising, protests changed. “It went from polite picketing to marching in the streets.” nps.gov/inde For several years, this former downtown hotel housed the Beaux Arts Cocktail Lounge. Newspaper advertisements in the 1950s labeled the bar “gay,” which historians say was meant as a coded message for homosexual customers. “It was a straight-looking hotel bar, but gay men knew they could meet other gay men there,” Springate says. nps.gov/places/elks-athletic-club.htm So many gay rights leaders are buried here that they’ve inspired a walking tour brochure. “It may be the only cemetery in the world with a special LGBTQ corner,” Springate says. Graves include Vietnam veteran Leonard Matlovich, who appeared on the cover of Time magazine. His tombstone reads: “When I was in the military, they gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one."" congressionalcemetery.org Founded by a women’s collective, this building still houses community organizations, from a food bank to a street youth group. It’s where a memorial service was held for Harvey Milk, the first openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who was assassinated in 1978. “The whole community was able to find a space here,” Springate says. Another notable spot: Harvey Milk Plaza, where crowds gathered after his death. womensbuilding.org Visitors can stop outside this private home where Henry Gerber, the “Grandfather of the American Gay Movement,” was once a tenant. In 1924, he founded the Society for Human Rights, recognized as the country’s first gay rights group. “It was a way for people to meet each other and realize that they weren’t alone,” Springate says. chicago.gov Civil rights attorney Pauli Murray played a crucial role in shaping federal laws protecting women against employment discrimination. An African American who struggled throughout her life with her sexuality and gender identity, Murray helped found the National Organization for Women and advocated for both women’s rights and civil rights. “As a black queer person, this idea about equality was very personal for her,” Springate says. Her home is currently closed due to COVID-19, but an outdoor educational installation recounts Murray’s life and the history of the house. paulimurrayproject.org Acclaimed photographer Elizabeth Alice Austen shared this home (now a museum) with her partner, Gertrude Tate, for more than 50 years. While Austen’s photos at times showed subjects in gender-bending roles, her relationship has only recently gotten attention. “The connection between her personal identity and her work as an artist was missing. They have put that connection back,” Springate says. aliceausten.org",2021-06-01 07:03:56,Celebrate with pride: Visit these sites where LGBTQ history was made,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Miami Beach police received multiple 911 calls reporting a shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg, spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said in a social media         post. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. During the investigation, the heavily traveled MacArthur Causeway was shut down in both directions. It had reopened by early Tuesday. Rodriguez said “several possible suspects"" had been detained. Meanwhile, a manhunt continued Tuesday for three masked suspects who opened fire early Sunday outside a Miami banquet hall. On Monday, police released a surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah. The video showed three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two carried what police described as “assault-style rifles.” They began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, though police said the assailants had specific targets in mind. In addition to the two fatalities, three others were hospitalized in critical condition. Police did not release the victims' names, citing privacy laws. The SUV used in the shooting was found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of the banquet hall. Police said it had been reported stolen two weeks ago. Miami-Dade Police said Sunday’s shooting was unrelated to a drive-by shooting Friday night that killed a person and injured six others outside another venue in the the Wynwood area. Some witnesses likened the scene to a “war zone” after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying for cover. “This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we’re here mourning,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Monday press conference. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-01 07:38:00,Miami-area shootings mark bloody Memorial Day weekend,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
429,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/653722682/0/milwaukee/news~After-repeated-ATF-warnings-gun-dealers-can-count-on-the-agency-to-back-off-sometimes-firearms-flow-to-criminals/,"Illustrations: Andrea Brunty, USA TODAY Network On Main Street in Man, West Virginia, a woman marched through the front door of Uncle Sam’s Loans, a cavernous pawn shop packed with hunting bows, fishing lures and camping supplies for the residents of this small Appalachian town. Behind the counter hung the linchpin of Uncle Sam’s business: guns. The woman flashed her credentials, which revealed that she was an investigator with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun industry watchdog. She was here to make sure Uncle Sam’s had cleaned up its act. This was the ATF’s third inspection of Uncle Sam’s in seven years. The two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers. At one point, ATF records show, more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found – a red flag for gun trafficking. In both cases, the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping Uncle Sam’s of its license to sell guns, according to ATF records. But agency officials decided to spare the shop, issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules. As the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014, she discovered that things had hardly improved. Sales records were incomplete, the store failed to report required information to law enforcement, and safety notices still weren’t going out. The inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors. Their decision: Issue yet another warning. Months later, the ATF learned that Uncle Sam’s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme. Witnesses told the agency that Steven Adkins, a longtime shop employee who’d purchased a stake in the business, had enlisted a host of people, including a colleague’s girlfriend and his brother-in-law, to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions, according to court records. In reality, the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay-to-play scheme at a local mine. Others were sold on the black market, witnesses said. One accomplice told investigators “hundreds, if not thousands of firearms” had been trafficked through Uncle Sam’s. According to court records, he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store, loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon. Another accomplice said he drove guns from Uncle Sam’s to Adkins’s home, where Adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement. Adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to August 2014. He was sentenced to 10 months in prison. No one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme. “Everybody knew where to get a firearm: Adkins,” said Roger D.B. Muncy, whose father founded Uncle Sam’s in 1975. “We’re all human, but you don’t send guns out the back door.” The ATF is facing intense scrutiny as the Senate considers President Joe Biden’s pick for the agency’s first permanent director in six years. The confirmation of David Chipman, a former ATF agent who has advocated stricter gun laws, is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the White House to clamp down on easy access to firearms. In one of the most sweeping examinations of ATF inspection records, The Trace and USA TODAY found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory, bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as Uncle Sam’s – and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals. Gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the USA. The Trace and USA TODAY’s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries. Reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2,000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017. The reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules, selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers, lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct. In many cases when the ATF caught dealers breaking the law, the agency issued warnings, sometimes repeatedly, and allowed the stores to operate for months or years. Others are still selling guns to this day. More than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly, waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results. More than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them. Dozens made false statements in official records, a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases. A Florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a Taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot, and an Arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he’d failed the background check because of an active restraining order. In Ohio, one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times; another was missing some 600 firearms. A Pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the ATF. But the store was allowed to remain in business, and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members, including his 7-year-old half-brother. The reports were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the gun control group Brady and shared with The Trace and USA TODAY reporters, who conducted an independent analysis. The reports detail inspections of brick-and-mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers, including home-based sellers, independent mom-and-pops and big-box retailers such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Others cover gun manufacturers and importers. More: A Journal Sentinel investigation uncovered a lack of government oversight in undercover ATF stings across the country More: How Congress created special rules for gun stores that protect even the biggest sellers of guns to criminals The data is extensive, but may not be comprehensive. The agency provided Brady roughly 2,000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters, warning conferences and license revocations over the two-year span from July 2015 through June 2017. However, annual fact sheets published by the ATF include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017, a period that overlaps with the Brady documents. The ATF repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating. A single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if ATF officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations. In the vast majority of the cases analyzed by The Trace and USA TODAY, the ATF gave violators the lightest penalty available: a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to “reduce violent crime and protect the public.” The agency revoked a gun dealer’s license in less than 3% of cases. Gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear. One owner told an ATF investigator that he was “busy” and didn’t “give a s---,” the agency records show. Another said he “did not like being told what to do.” The owner of a pawn shop in northeastern Kansas became “very belligerent and hostile” when questioned about falsifying records, shaking his finger in the investigator’s face as he told her to “do her job and stop messing with him.” The ATF allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms. Joseph Bisbee, a retired ATF agent in Seattle, said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity. “There’s really no teeth to the laws, and gun dealers know that,” he said. “They can see that nobody gets prosecuted, that nobody gets held accountable, and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it.” The problems extend high into the management ranks of ATF. The Trace and USA TODAY’s review found that the managers of on-the-ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments. Reporters identified 138 reports in which ATF officials acknowledged that a dealer’s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses. The agency revoked 56 of those licenses, just over 40%. A majority were granted lesser penalties, ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters. In the reports, ATF officials justified backing off by citing the dealer’s age, recent health problems, intentions to retire and, in one case, “affluent clientele.” One dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year; another because he had been in business for decades. Sometimes, the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue. In 2017, an inspector advocated pulling the license for Back Acre Gun Works after reporting the gun shop west of Orlando, Florida, had falsified records related to the transfer of an AR-15-style rifle. A supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning, noting “substantial legal liabilities” because the inspection had been conducted “prematurely.” Current and former ATF officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency’s enforcement powers. Some also say the ATF has increasingly adopted an industry-friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority. “They hardly do any inspections, and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they’re not a big deal because they don’t want to upset the industry too much,” said Mark Jones, who held various supervisory positions at the ATF before retiring in 2012. The proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across America, ripe for targeting by criminals. Kris Brown, Brady’s president, said the ATF “bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity.” “And Americans every day pay the price,” Brown said, “particularly Black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers.” The coronavirus pandemic, protests against police brutality and the election of Biden spurred Americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020, shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the ATF can adequately police such a booming industry. “The most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands,” said John Crecca, a former ATF inspector who worked in New York and Pennsylvania before retiring in 2011. Crecca recalled the case of Bull’s Eye Shooter Supply, a gun store in Tacoma, Washington, that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks, in which two gunmen armed with a Bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people. One of the Beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from Bull’s Eye. The shop hadn’t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling. A subsequent ATF inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns. Bull’s Eye settled the lawsuit for $2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings. In the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license, the process is slow, often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns. Sometimes, the ATF holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory, reports show. The ATF is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market. The agency’s weaknesses have prompted Illinois, New Jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs. In Illinois, the ATF held warning conferences with 1st Class Firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of Waukegan had failed to conduct background checks, kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out-of-state residents, records show. Allowed to remain in business, 1st Class Firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the U.S. from Mexico, according to court records. Inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st Class Firearms for 12 more violations. This time, agency officials determined that the store’s license should be revoked. According to records, one supervisor railed against the owner, Craig Bricco, for “displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements.” Bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees, who ran the store while he was working another job during the day. “I got bamboozled,” Bricco said. “There wasn’t much I could do.” Instead of revoking his license, Bricco said the ATF allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms. Bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer’s license after that period, but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer. He rebranded as 1st Class Ammo and transferred the shop’s leftover gun inventory to himself — a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales. In much of the country, private sales require no background checks. In January 2016, 1st Class Ammo shared a Facebook post directing people to GunBroker.com, where Bricco was selling four Sig Sauer pistols. “So it’s a private sale?” one Facebook user asked. “Yes, all private sales,” 1st Class Ammo responded, “you can see them on display in the ammo store.” Some current and former ATF officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers obey the rules without driving them out of business for fleeting missteps and unintentional errors. Thomas Brandon, the bureau’s acting director from 2015 to 2019, said the goal is not to penalize gun shops and other federal firearms licensees but to gain their compliance. “The high majority of FFLs are good hardworking people running businesses, and they’re our front-line of defense for intelligence for diversion of firearms with straw purchases,” Brandon said. Brandon, who now works in sales for a ballistics technology firm that contracts with the ATF and law enforcement, said the agency focuses its limited resources on “the 1% doing it wrong.” In an emailed response to questions, ATF spokesman Andre Miller portrayed the penalties as “tools to guide” dealers into correcting violations and “ensure future compliance.” He said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider “the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide.” “The nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as ATF’s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action,” Miller said. A DIVISION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, the ATF is responsible for policing the 78,000 gun dealers, manufacturers and importers in the U.S. It employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews, digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn’t have them. The goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years. But federal data shows the agency has averaged 15% of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019. This means dealers were visited about once every seven years. Of all the inspections during that decade, at least a third – 35,500 – found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws, the agency data shows. More than 81% of violators received no penalty or a written warning. The ATF sought revocation of only 580 violators, or 1.6%. In the 2020 fiscal year, as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations, the ATF inspected only 5,827 licensed dealers, or 7.5% – the lowest annual inspection rate since 2004. More than 2,400 of those dealers were found to have committed violations. Forty dealers had their licenses revoked. The most common violations cited by the ATF were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers’ personal details, omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records, according to the reports analyzed by The Trace and USA TODAY. Former ATF officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales. But even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer’s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking, or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes. “Whenever you hear people say ‘There’s plenty of laws on the books,’ there really aren’t. What there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper,” said Scot Thomasson, the ATF’s former chief of public affairs. “But what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime, a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market.” Gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection. Former ATF officials attributed the agency’s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability. Over the past 35 years, gun groups have successfully pressured Congress to limit the frequency of inspections, restrict ATF from consolidating and computerizing records, and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers’ licenses away. In 1986, the National Rifle Association successfully lobbied for the passage of the Firearm Owners’ Protection Act, which prevents the ATF from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year. After 9/11, Congress required that the ATF audit each of the nation’s 9,400 explosives dealers once every three years – effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections. The number of gun dealer inspections plunged, falling from an average of nearly 12,000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7,000 a year in the 2000s. “ATF is a very small agency, a very unpopular agency, and as a result, there are a lot of people trying to push them around,” said Howard Wolfe, a former ATF supervisor who oversaw inspections in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania until he retired in 2006. Wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the ATF’s inspection goals. “There was no way,” Wolfe said. “People went years without being inspected, and that’s a big problem, because how do you know how somebody’s doing if you don’t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records?” ATF investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by The Trace and USA TODAY. One particularly taxing case, in Houston, took 995 hours, the equivalent of half a year of workdays. The investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director, who cited the “length of time taken to complete the assignment.” In another case in Kansas, A Pawn Shop transferred an AK-47-type rifle and a Glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend, a convicted felon, court records indicate. In February 2016, he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of Newton and Hesston. An ATF inspector visited A Pawn Shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper IDs, sold a handgun to a self-identified domestic abuser, and hadn’t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers, according to an agency report. The ATF downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business. “Had the ATF gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act. It might have prevented a mass shooting,” said David Morantz, an attorney who represented one of the Hesston shooting victims’ surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop. The lawsuit resulted in a $2 million settlement. The shop is now closed. Teresa Ficaretta, a former senior ATF attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law, said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns, frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags. Ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law. “If licensees knew that ATF was going to show up like clockwork, they would put a lot more effort into maintaining compliance,” she said. “But right now there’s this incentive for them to roll the dice and see what happens.” The size of the ATF’s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades. In early 2016, after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, the Obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly $12.3 million to add 120 ATF investigators. The Republican-controlled Congress balked, with one GOP member of the House Appropriations Committee saying lawmakers would not support “the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous Second Amendment rights of Americans.” B. Todd Jones, a former U.S. attorney who served as the ATF’s last Senate-confirmed leader before resigning in 2015, said that despite the “20-plus years of regulatory handcuffs,” investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight. “We did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders,” said Jones, who is now chief disciplinary officer for the NFL. “It’s like setting up a speed trap: You’re not going to stop everyone. And if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it. But what’s the alternative? No regulation at all?” The ATF investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests. They can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties, known as “adverse actions,” but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations, who make the final call. The Trace and USA TODAY found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions. For example, at the Louisville field division – which covers Kentucky, West Virginia and southern Indiana – reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer’s violations warranted revocation. Nine of those recommendations were approved by the division’s industry operations director. In contrast, the industry operations director for the Seattle field division – which covers Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam – approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators. Jim Zammillo, a former ATF deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010, said the Justice Department’s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently, prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s. Chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found. The guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses, and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters. Know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the ATF? Share this story The increased oversight led to greater standardization, Zammillo said, but it also caused consternation among field division heads. “They viewed it like, ‘I’m the sheriff, this is my department, and I’m going to run it the way that I want to,’” Zammillo said. John Jarowski, a former industry operations director in St. Paul, Minnesota, offered another explanation, saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators. “Inspectors go in and they want the kill. They want the scalp on their belt,” Jarowski said. Proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court, a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years. U.S. attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the ATF. “Many times when the U.S. attorney steps in he’d say, ‘This dog won’t hunt,’ and they’d drop it,” Jarowski said. “So you have to think about spending your resources wisely.” In many areas of civil and criminal law, defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior. When it comes to gun sellers, Congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully, forcing the ATF to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them. Jack & Dick’s Pawn Shop in Junction City, Kansas, received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016. When the ATF returned in 2017, it uncovered four additional violations, including making false statements in required records, a report shows. The false statements charge stemmed from the case of a Fort Riley army soldier who’d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop, according to a police report. The soldier, 20, was underage for handgun purchases in Kansas. He had had a friend fill out the paperwork. ATF records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke Jack & Dick’s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase, including when the friend paid using the soldier’s credit card. The investigator was overruled by higher-ups, who said it wasn’t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card. The ATF decided to give Jack & Dick’s another written warning. The owner of the shop declined to comment for this article. In 2017 and 2020, the shop released surveillance photos and video on its Facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime. When the ATF does decide to revoke a dealer’s license, the agency’s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands. JC’s Guns & Tackle Shop in Huntsville, Alabama, received its first compliance inspection in 2013, resulting in a warning conference. Investigators returned two years later for a second inspection that uncovered 13 violations, six of them repeated, according to an ATF report. The shop had failed to report multiple sales, falsified forms and sold guns to people who’d self-identified as being prohibited. It failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees, which is illegal, the report indicates. Investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases, selling weapons to stand-ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed. It took the ATF 16 months to revoke JC’s license. During that time, according to court records, the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend, a convicted felon. Gun store owners offered the ATF a litany of excuses to explain away violations. The agency spared a Nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was  “very busy and overwhelmed.” A Pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales. During the last inspection, in 2016, the owner told an ATF investigator he meant to file the reports “but did not get around to it.” Felex Yukhtman said he trusted the “wrong people” to manage his small gun manufacturing business in Bradenton, Florida. Yukhtman’s company, Gun Point, specializes in building custom ARs. In 2017, an ATF supervisor upheld an inspector’s recommendation to shut Yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations. They included the possession of illegal machine guns, later seized by agents. Yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms, he said in an interview. The supervisor criticized Yukhtman for having “shown a pattern of repeated violations” despite the ATF “educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008.” The industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned Yukhtman in for another warning conference. Yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the ATF for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes. “They’re not there to take your license or make your life miserable,” Yukhtman said. “The less work they have to do at your store, the less time they have to be there, the better it is for them.” To obtain a federal firearms sales license, applicants have to mail in their fingerprints and a photograph along with a four-page form containing basic business and biographical information. The form also requires applicants to check a box to indicate whether they have a felony conviction, were ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms. The price of a firearms license ranges from $30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as $3,000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades. The license held by many retail gun dealers costs $200 for the first three years and $90 for every renewal. Applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test. The ATF instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business. Still, ATF officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency. A dealer in Pounding Mill, Virginia, avoided a warning conference after expressing “his apparent shock,” according to a report, at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back-to-back handgun purchases. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry’s trade group, works with the ATF to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking. “By and large, firearm retailers are law-abiding and follow local, state and federal authorities,” said Mark Oliva, a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman. “We’re members of our community, mom-and-pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe.” The foundation recruits consultants and former ATF inspectors to put shops through mock inspections. For $750, the organization will run a full-day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings. It also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders, which Oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year. But Rich Marianos, a former ATF assistant director, said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible. In 2020, it spent $4.5 million on lobbying, more than twice as much as the National Rifle Association, which spent $2.2 million, according to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics. “They’re like the NRA,” Marianos said. “Never once have they said the ATF needs more money, help, support or resources.” Oliva disputes that characterization. He provided confidential records of the group’s lobbying of Congress in recent years to add millions for ATF’s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the Department of Justice. THE CALL THAT STARTED THE UNRAVELING of the gun trafficking operation at Uncle Sam's in West Virginia came in April 2015. The girlfriend of a former employee contacted an ATF agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store’s records as the purchaser of shotguns, rifles and a pistol. According to court records, she later told an ATF agent that Steven Adkins had paid her $75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person. It was a scheme Adkins had been running for at least six years, and he’d kept it hidden from the ATF even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe. After being indicted in late 2015, Adkins told the ATF that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store’s founder, Roger D. Muncy. According to court records, Adkins claimed Muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales, and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms, Muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through. Adkins estimated that 70% of the gun sales at Uncle Sam’s were illegal. The case reverberated across the small town of Man, where Adkins and Muncy were serving on the city council. In 2008, the city had renamed a street in Muncy’s honor. Adkins pleaded guilty in 2016, and the ATF pulled Uncle Sam’s gun license. Adkins, who has since been released from prison, declined requests to be interviewed for this article. Muncy was never charged, but the revocation didn’t stop him from profiting from guns. After losing the license to sell firearms at Uncle Sam’s, he rented the store to a state trooper, who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location. The arrangement lasted until July 2019, when the two parties had a falling out. In his testimony, Muncy denied wrongdoing in the Adkins case. He went on to operate Uncle Sam’s as a pawn shop until he died in December at the age of 68. His wife died four days later. Since then, the day-to-day management of the store has fallen to their son, Roger D.B. Muncy, who hopes to get back in the gun business. “The day my daddy and mommy died, I was calling Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms wanting to know if I was able to get a firearms license,” he said. “They said I need to file my application.” For this project, USA TODAY partnered with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to improving public understanding of gun violence, increasing accountability and identifying solutions.

Police say three people got out of an SUV early Sunday and began shooting “indiscriminately into the crowd” outside a “scheduled event,” NBC News reported. The venue of the event was a banquet hall. The gunmen allegedly waited outside for about 40 minutes before opening fire on patrons as they left, according to ABC News. Police say some patrons returned fire, and more than 100 shell casings were found at the scene of the shooting. The three gunmen used semi-automatic rifles and wore ski masks and hooded sweatshirts, according to the Miami Herald. Investigators say they believe the shooting was a dispute between two rival groups. The event venue, El Mula Banquet Hall, was hosting a weekend album release party the night before the shooting, featuring local rappers, including ABMG Spitta, the Miami Herald reported. Three of the 21 wounded victims are reportedly in critical condition and three have been released, including a 17-year-old teenager. The victims’ ages ranged from 17 to 32 years old.

The vehicle was reported stolen on May 15, police told Local 10. It was captured on a video showing the three gunmen leaving the vehicle.  Police are still searching for the shooters, although the investigation is made more complicated by people’s fear of retaliation if they break the code of silence on the streets, according to the Miami Herald.

431,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/01/texas-man-arrested-mass-shooting-walmart-plan-coleman-thomas-blevins,"Last modified on Tue 1 Jun 2021 20.26 BST A Texas man with “radical ideology paraphernalia” was thwarted last week after authorities intercepted a message detailing his plans for a mass shooting at a Walmart store, police said. Coleman Thomas Blevins, 28, was arrested north-west of San Antonio in Kerrville, Texas, on Friday for a terroristic threat to create public fear of serious bodily injury.  “Many think ‘that can’t happen here’, and it was well on the way to happening,” said the Kerr county sheriff, Larry Leitha, adding that investigators “possibly saved many lives”. “The plot interrupted in this case is unthinkable,” he said. During a week-long operation, law enforcement “made contact and conversed with” Blevins, who is white, confirming “his affiliation and networking with extremist ideologies”, according to a news release. On 27 May, Blevins “made a specific threat” involving a mass casualty event at a Walmart, and the FBI and local sheriff’s office confirmed his ability to carry it out, the release said. After arresting Blevins, authorities searched his residence, where they found firearms, concentrated THC, ammunition, electronic evidence and what they dubbed “radical ideology paraphernalia” such as books, flags and handwritten documents. The sheriff’s office posted a photo of the haul, which included a Confederate flag and a copy of The Turner Diaries, a novel by the neo-Nazi William Luther Pierce that depicts an Aryan revolt against the US government. Blevins is on active felony probation and is not allowed to possess firearms. He was taken to Kerr county jail and is being held on a $250,00 bond, according to jail records. In 2019, another white man, Patrick Crusius, drove across Texas to target Hispanic people at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso. That racist attack left 23 people dead. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security called violent white supremacy the “most persistent and lethal threat in the homeland”. The US is also dogged by a general epidemic of gun violence, with 239 mass shootings already in 2021, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

News By Joshua Rhett Miller Submit June 1, 2021 | 11:08am				| Updated June 1, 2021 | 11:18am Police have located the SUV used by three gunmen in a mass shooting outside a Miami rap concert — submerged in a canal that is well-known to locals as a dumping ground. Cops told reporters at a press conference Monday that the stolen Nissan Pathfinder used in Sunday’s violence outside the El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County was recovered about 8 miles away from the shooting scene. Neighbors told local broadcaster WPLG-10 that the canal is a “notorious dumping ground.” The SUV had been reported stolen on May 15, police said. Investigators believe the mass shooting — which killed two people and wounded 21 others — was connected to an ongoing rivalry between two groups. The target or targets of the gunfire were out front of the banquet hall when the shooting barrage started, the Miami Herald reported. The organizers of the event billed it as an album release party for rapper ABMG Spitta, WPLG reported. The rapper, who was shot in the ankle, was one of the wounded victims, authorities have said. Miami-Dade police also released surveillance footage of the three suspected shooters getting out of the SUV while wearing masks and carrying a handgun and assault-style rifles. The suspects then ran out of the camera’s view as they headed to the banquet hall near the County Club of Miami, where they fired dozens of shots, the Herald reported. Some in the crowd returned fire, the outlet said. Other surveillance footage obtained by the newspaper reportedly showed the SUV slowly driving through a parking lot before the mass shooting erupted. Seventeen victims, including five women, remained hospitalized Monday, including three in critical condition, WPLG reported. A $130,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the ongoing investigation, the station reported. The victims ranged in age from 17 to 32 years old, WPLG reported. The father of a 26-year-old man broke down in tears at the scene Monday, saying his son was one of the two people killed by the suspects, whom Miami-Dade Police Director Freddy Ramirez has characterized as “cold-blooded” killers. “I need to hold him,” Clayton Dillard said of his son, Clayton Dillard III. “I need to hold him. You killed the wrong kids!” Another 26-year-old man was also killed in the mass shooting, WPLG reported.

437,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/technology/smartphone-videos-police-violence.html,"Advertisement Supported by on tech Smartphone videos are tools for bearing witness and holding the powerful to account. But they come at a cost. By Shira Ovide This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays. Bystander smartphone videos, like the one that Darnella Frazier took a year ago of the murder of George Floyd, have provided powerful documentation of acts of racism or police brutality. Phones and social media have also empowered people to tell their own stories and helped bring more attention to the mistreatment of Black Americans. But Allissa V. Richardson, a professor of journalism and communication at the University of Southern California, says that it’s enough already. Videos like the ones of the deaths of Floyd and Eric Garner in 2014 are important legal and historical records, Dr. Richardson said, but those videos can repeatedly re-expose crime victims, their family members and witnesses to their worst moments. And they can make it seem like Black Americans need to provide proof of racist violence to be believed. “We in the public don’t need these videos anymore,” Dr. Richardson said. “They belong in the realm of the families and juries.” Technology puts in people’s hands the tools to bear witness, hold the powerful accountable and better understand our world. Dr. Richardson is asking us to balance those benefits against the costs of what happens to the people involved after the recordings end. Talking to her broadened my thinking, and I hope her comments do the same for you. Dr. Richardson, who wrote the book “Bearing Witness While Black,” put the current era’s bystander videos of police violence in historical context. She said there is a long track record of Black Americans forcing awareness of racist violence, including Ida B. Wells’s accounts of lynchings, Mamie Till Mobley’s insistence on showing the public her son’s mutilated body and civil rights marchers’ beatings in Selma, Ala., in 1965. In the past, however, Dr. Richardson said that Black Americans were sometimes able to choose for themselves whether and how to tell their stories publicly. That control is now more elusive. Philonise Floyd, a brother of George Floyd, has written about how he saw his brother die a thousand times in the last year. Frazier and Ramsey Orta, who recorded a video of Garner’s death, have spoken about the toll the experience took on them. And Dr. Richardson said that photos or videos of violent attacks against mostly white Americans, including the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, aren’t typically replayed on endless loops. She also said that the videos of police violence against Black Americans create a cruel feedback loop in which future victims are expected to provide visual documentation of violence against them. “How many times do people need to see the same thing reiterated?” Dr. Richardson said. We can’t ignore the benefits of technology that let people show their points of view to the world. But we also can’t overlook the unintended consequences when life — particularly our darkest moments — is so public. Jeffrey Middleton, a judge in Michigan, recently attracted attention for lamenting that no one asked defendants or crime victims if they wanted to be in court proceedings that were webcast publicly. “Some of these have become embarrassing, perhaps humiliating,” Judge Middleton said last month. I asked Dr. Richardson what we should do to mitigate the hurt of violent videos. She has written that news organizations should not show videos of people’s death without the permission of the families, and that they should be more judicious about how often images of racist violence are shown. As for the general public, she suggested reconsidering watching or sharing videos of violence against Black Americans. It might be more productive to take actions like pushing for police reform laws or supporting political candidates whose policies you agree with. “We should celebrate the people who have the bravery and the presence of mind to record them,” Dr. Richardson told me about bystander videos. “We should question the system that requires them to record them in the first place.” The rural-urban digital divide: Politicians focus a lot on increasing internet access in unconnected rural areas. But my colleague Eduardo Porter writes that with limited taxpayer funds, making internet service more affordable and relevant in highly wired urban areas might bring more bang for the buck. Why can’t we move past our long digital histories? Internet evangelists once predicted that being constantly online would make people more empathetic and forgiving about one another’s past mistakes. My colleague Kashmir Hill explores why the opposite has happened. Here’s why your Uber is probably more expensive: It’s economics 101. There’s more demand from riders than supply of drivers, and Uber and Lyft are paying drivers more and passing that cost on to you, my colleague Kate Conger reported. (Supply and demand imbalances are why lots of stuff, including lumber and rental cars, are more expensive right now.) Why did the moose cross the road? (You know how this joke ends.)

We will leave no stone unturned. We will leave nothing behind to bring these shooters to justice.” Early Sunday, as you can see in the video below, three males got out of an SUV and “began shooting indiscriminately into the crowd” outside a “scheduled event” at an establishment on 186th Street, in the Hialeah area west of Miami Gardens, Miami-Dade police said in a statement. The venue was a banquet hall that had been rented out for a concert, NBC Miami reported.

Police search for gunmen after Miami mass shooting kills 2, injures at least 20 It was a violent Memorial Day weekend for many American cities. Gun violence in the U.S. is surging. So far, 8,100 people in the United States have died from gun violence in 2021 as of Sunday, according to the Gun Violence Archive, putting the year on track to match the over 19,000 who were killed in 2020. Those numbers mark significant increases from 2019, when over 15,000 people died by gun violence. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, 23 people were shot in a mass shooting outside a banquet hall early Sunday, including two who were killed. Authorities said they believe the shooting at the El Mula Banquet Hall in Hialeah, Florida, was motivated by an ""ongoing rivalry"" between two groups. The shooters reportedly waited outside of the banquet hall for about 40 minutes before exiting their car and opening fire, Miami-Dade Police Director Freddy Ramirez told ABC News on Sunday. Some patrons returned fire, Ramirez said, and over 100 shell casings were found at the scene. The three suspected shooters remain at large. Despite a cold and rainy holiday weekend, 16 people were shot in Philadelphia between Friday and Monday, including four people who were killed, police said. The violence didn't stop once the holiday weekend ended. Two deadly shootings unfolded in southwest Philadelphia just minutes apart early Tuesday: A 35-year-old man was shot at least four times at close range near his home, and a 28-year-old man was shot at least twice in a bowling alley parking lot, ABC Philadelphia station WPVI reported. In Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, multiple shootings were reported in public places over Memorial Day weekend. An employee at a nail salon was shot on Saturday, and deadly gunfire erupted at a nightclub early Monday, according to the sheriff's office. In New York City, shootings were reported in all five boroughs Monday night. A total of nine shootings were reported in New York on Memorial Day. Among the 15 victims was a 15-year-old who died, police said. New York City is experiencing a massive spike in gun violence. Shootings are up 77% from the same time last year. There have been 573 shootings so far this year with 652 victims, a drastic increase from the 323 incidents with 366 victims at this point last year. ""A lot of the time you have individuals shooting at other individuals that are known,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told local station NY1 on Tuesday, ""but as the tide rises, you start to see more and more innocent people getting shot, too."" ""Incidents of gunfire, whether anyone is hit or not, really traumatizes the whole block. Then you start thinking, 'I don't want to send my kids out to the store or to play in front of the house,'"" Shea said. ""So this is something that affects all of us, and that's why we're so committed to stopping it."" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki last week said, ""Certainly, there is a guns problem."" “And that's something the president would say, and there are communities where local violence and community violence is an issue. And that's one of the reasons that we have proposed and ... now are implementing funding for community violence prevention programs across the country,” she said, underscoring President Joe Biden’s support for passing universal background checks.

News By Lee Brown Submit June 1, 2021 | 2:30pm				| Updated June 1, 2021 | 2:39pm  One of the San Jose railyard workers killed last week was heading home after his shift when he was gunned down, his widow revealed in a tearful interview. “He was off shift … he had already started up his truck,” Terra Fritch told ABC 30 of her husband of 19 years, Alex Fritch. “He was 5 feet away from the door — away from this, and being home with me,” she said with tears running down her neck. “I think hurts more than anything. Because he was not supposed to be there. He got off at 6:30 a.m.,” she said of the mass shooting by a fellow railyard worker, Samuel Cassidy, that started minutes later. While eight others were pronounced dead at the scene, Fritch died hours later, clutching his wife’s hand in a hospital bed, his widow said. “He actually moved his wrist and grabbed my hand,” Terra Fritch told ABC 30. “He had tears coming out of both of his eyes and I felt him pass. I literally felt it. “He didn’t want to leave. He wanted to be here with me,” she said. She gave the interview in the tiki bar her 49-year-old husband built at their San Jose home — dubbed the “Fred and Ginger Exotic Rum and Cocktail Bar.” “He put in every single nail, every single screw,” she said of her husband’s “labor of love.” “This is where I feel the closest to him. I’m just so thankful that I have it because he really, really loved this bar,” she said, saying she will likely never leave the house to keep hold of those memories. Mass shooter Cassidy carried “a black memo book filled with lots of notes” about hating his place of work, and was reportedly questioned by federal agents years before the slaughter. He had amassed a terrifying arsenal, and his rampage reportedly came hours before he was due to attend a work disciplinary hearing for alleged racist comments. As well as Fritch, Cassidy killed Paul Delacruz Megia, 42, Taptejdeep Singh, 36, Adrian Balleza, 29, Jose Dejesus Hernandez, 35, Timothy Michael Romo, 49, Michael Joseph Rudometkin, 40, Abdolvahab Alaghmandan, 63, and Lars Kepler Lane, 63. He then shot himself dead when he was cornered by officers, authorities have said. Read Next Terrifying video captures crazed hippo chasing tourists on...

Cities in parts of the U.S. grappled with high numbers of shootings and killings over Memorial Day weekend, with at least one reporting as many as 10 murders over the extended holiday, according to officials and reports. The warmer-weather months are often notorious for yielding higher crime rates in parts of the country and causing some agencies, such as the New York Police Department, to deploy more officers to high-crime areas. Crime analysts and experts have said they anticipated summer 2021 violence could be just as bad as – if not worse than last year amid upticks in shootings and murders that started earlier than usual. Cities such as Houston, Miami and New Orleans saw startling spates of violence over the extended weekend.

      (Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via A) There were 10 murders reported throughout the Texas city from Friday afternoon through Monday evening, local news station KPRC 2 reported. Houston Police Chief Troy Finner told reporters on Monday the city had grappled with ""a very violent weekend, Memorial Day weekend."" Just Monday morning, a gunman opened fire inside a Houston nightclub, where he killed one person and wounded two others before he was mortally wounded, according to police officials. An off-duty Harris County sheriff’s deputy was working security at the nightclub at the time and fatally shot the suspect after shots rang out around 1:15 p.m., police said. Police said one other person was pronounced dead at the scene. A second person was struck several times and was in critical condition, police said, while a third person was treated for a gunshot wound to the leg. Three people were killed and a total of 27 were shot in Chicago over the extended holiday weekend, police said Tuesday. There were 32 people wounded in the 27 shootings citywide from 6 p.m. Friday through 11:59 p.m. Monday, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) said. CHICAGO COPS AND COMMUNITY PRAY FOR PEACEFUL, SAFE SUMMER The murder victims were all men and ranging in age from 26 to 40, police said. The suspects in the three shootings are still on the loose. The Memorial Day weekend usually sees violence across Windy City neighborhoods. Last year’s Memorial Day weekend saw the most shootings since 2015 with at least nine people fatally shot and dozens more wounded. Miami authorities released surveillance video Monday showing a group of men with weapons pulling up beside a banquet hall where two people were killed early Sunday morning and scores were injured. The vehicle they were traveling in was found hours later submerged in a canal. 
      (Miami-Dade Police Department) At least two people were killed and 23 others were wounded during the Miami area’s violent Memorial Day weekend, law enforcement authorities said. A manhunt continued Tuesday for three masked suspects who opened fire early Sunday outside a Miami banquet hall. On Monday, police released a surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah. MIAMI-DADE POLICE FIND SUV USED IN MASS SHOOTING SUBMERGED IN CANAL, HOURS AFTER RELEASE OF VIDEO The video showed three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two carried what police described as ""assault-style rifles."" They began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, though police said the assailants had specific targets in mind. In addition to the two fatalities, three others were hospitalized in critical condition. Police did not release the victims' names, citing privacy laws. Then, Miami Beach police received multiple 911 calls reporting a shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg, spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said in a social media post. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson speaks to reporters. There were more than a half-dozen shootings across New Orleans that left three dead, including a 12-year-old, and at least 12 others injured, according to the city’s police department. The child was fatally shot Sunday night at a birthday party in the Holy Cross neighborhood, WWL-TV reported. First responders took her to the hospital, where she died from her injuries. Also injured were a 19-year-old man and an unknown third victim, who were both hospitalized. NEW ORLEANS VIOLENCE: GIRL, 12, AT GRADUATION PARTY AMONG 3 KILLED IN BLOODY WEEKEND The shooting was one of several such incidents in New Orleans this weekend, as the city gets aid from Louisiana State Police in patrolling high-crime areas. In a change of strategy, state troopers will be added to patrols in several neighborhoods and not just exclusively in the French Quarter. ""We have seen increases in homicides. We’ve seen increases in non-fatal shootings. We have seen increases in carjackings,"" said New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson. There were 20 shootings reported in the Big Apple from Friday through Monday, with 26 wounded victims, the New York Police Department told Fox News. Fifteen people were shot on Monday alone, police said. Seven murders were reported over the four-day period, a decrease of one compared to last year's holiday weekend.

ABC 7 reports that the shooting occurred “around 11 a.m.” The Associated Press notes the fire station is “about 45 miles north of Los Angeles.” Patch explained that a search for a male suspect “in a white Toyota pickup” led to a home on Bent Spur Drive in Acton, but Fox 11 pointed out that authorities arrived to find the home on fire. The shooting suspect is believed to be a “disgruntled employee.” California witnessed a mass shooting in San Jose on March 26, 2021. That shooting resulted in the loss of eight innocents, and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) responded to the shooting by claiming gun control still works. California has universal background checks, a red flag law, firearm registration requirements, an “assault weapons” ban, a 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, and a limit on how many guns a law-abiding citizen can buy in a month, among other controls. The state also has tight controls on ammunition.

Wisdom Awute, 21, and Christopher Urena, 29, were arrested in the shooting shortly after 11:30 p.m. Monday, Miami Beach police said Tuesday. A witness told police he recognized Awute as a rapper known as Wisdom who was part of rapper DaBaby's entourage, according to an arrest report. DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, was interviewed and released by police and has not been charged, police and his attorney said. Awute and Urena were arrested on charges of attempted murder and assault, the arrest reports say. Awute allegedly shot someone in the leg. Urena is charged with additional counts, including theft and a weapons charge, according to the arrest documents. It was not immediately clear Tuesday night if either man had an attorney who could comment on their behalf. The shooting at First Street and Ocean Drive, near the Prime 112 steakhouse, followed an argument between two groups, according to an arrest report. It's not clear what the argument was about. One of the shooting victims was treated and released, and the other was in a hospital in critical condition, Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said. ""At first it was like two or three shots, and then a couple seconds later it was like 'pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,' a whole bunch of shooting,"" James Dozier, who had just eaten at Prime 112 when gunfire erupted, told NBC Miami. ""And then you can hear the car zooming down the road,"" he said. ""You heard a car, like, trying to get away."" DaBaby's song ""Rockstar"" was a hit when it came out last year, and Billboard listed it as No. 1 on its ""Songs of the Summer."" It was also nominated for a Grammy for record of the year.

The gathering was part of The Yellow Whistle Campaign, a national effort to bring awareness to racism and  violence directed at members of the AAPI community. “The Yellow Whistle is a symbol of self-protection and solidarity in our common fight against historical discrimination and anti-Asian violence,” the campaign’s website says, noting that the color yellow has been used in racism directed at Asians. “The whistle is a simple gadget with a universal purpose — to signal alarm and call for help — for all Americans.” Other cities across the country also planned rallies, according to The Boston Globe. Monday was the last day of AAPI Heritage Month. “We should not be silent,” Esther Lee, a speaker during the rally, told the crowd. Racism and violence has been directed toward the AAPI community throughout the pandemic and has sparked other rallies. A mass shooting in Atlanta left six Asian women dead back in March. “The fires of racism have been burning in our country for far too long, 400 years in fact, and we will not let this stand in Boston,” Acting Mayor Kim Janey said during Monday’s rally. Prior to Monday’s event, a group of teenagers handed out safety devices to Asian American seniors in Boston’s Chinatown on Saturday. The group of volunteers had raised about $4,000 to buy the alarms and handed out over 700 of them, according to WCVB. The group went to three senior housing complexes and also handed out the devices at the Chinatown entrance, WCVB reported. “I really just wanted to help the Asian American community in Boston as much as I could,” Ryan Ho told the news station. “We’re definitely sad about what’s going on.” The group says they want to raise more money to buy more alarms.

Anderson tweeted his innocence over the holiday weekend but stepped down from the school board because schools and pederasts don’t mix well when the cops are sniffing around.

The Colorado Herald said, “While DPS (Denver Public Schools) continues to dodge the issue and protect its prodigal son, the continued deflection of responsibility for protecting underage students by DPS is saddening and frightening.” “When Anderson was elected, at his first board meeting,” the Herald continued, “he said he would remain seated during the pledge of allegiance. ‘We will not stand while our country separates families and keeps kids in cages,’ Anderson said at the event.” Anderson also drew criticism last March when he accused a white man of committing a mass shooting in Colorado and the shooter turned out to be a pro-ISIS Muslim male from Syria.

448,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/06/01/return-of-vta-light-rail-will-take-weeks-or-months-after-mass-shooting/,"Trending: It may take months to resume service on the Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail system following last week’s mass shooting that left 10 workers dead, an agency spokeswoman said Tuesday. The service was suspended indefinitely hours after a disgruntled maintenance worker opened fire last Wednesday morning at VTA’s light rail yard, killing nine of his coworkers before taking his own life. On Tuesday the agency discontinued the buses that were temporarily running along the light rail’s three lines — leaving transit riders to rely on the rest of the South Bay’s bus routes to get around. Now, both physically and emotionally, VTA faces a long, difficult and delicate task to get the trains that once carried over 25,000 riders each weekday running again. The Guadalupe Yard, which functions as the nerve center of the light rail network, is a crime scene. Traumatized VTA workers who survived the shooting have funerals to attend — and beyond that may be reluctant to return to the buildings where their friends were killed and they fled the sounds of gunfire. “There is no consideration of bringing light rail service back right now,” VTA spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said, with the agency instead focused on supporting the workers who lost colleagues. Light rail’s return “will be a matter of weeks or months, and not days,” she said. There is no timeline for when law enforcement investigators will turn the light rail yard — where trains are stored, serviced and dispatched — back to VTA, said Deputy Russell Davis, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. It’s unclear how badly damaged the buildings are and what can — or must — be done to clean, repair, or relocate facilities that until Wednesday served as the hub of daily activity. “The whole system is run out of that light rail yard,” said Hendler Ross. During Wednesday’s rampage, 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy killed his colleagues in a maintenance building, then walked across the yard and continued shooting inside the three-story building that houses offices and VTA’s Operations Control Center. Employees have been able to retrieve their cars from the property, Davis said, but have not been allowed inside its buildings since the shooting. Hendler Ross said VTA officials are considering how they might be able to run the light rail system without using the Guadalupe Yard, because its operations control center can be moved to other VTA facilities. But she said that will be a challenge, because trains regularly need maintenance that must be done there. VTA is having to confront a question that Americans have grappled with at schools, workplaces, churches, shopping centers and countless other public spaces across the country: What do you do with the scene of a mass shooting? At Columbine High School in Colorado, Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and Umpqua Community College in Oregon, officials demolished and rebuilt the places where gunmen carried out massacres, according to The Washington Post. At Virginia Tech, a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, the Post reported buildings went through extensive renovations that ranged from several months to upwards of a year. There are some examples of mass shooting sites reopening quickly. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, held Sunday services four days after a 2015 massacre by a White supremacist gunman. A UPS distribution center in San Francisco reopened within weeks of a 2017 workplace shooting, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, which reported that weeks later, most drivers refused to go back in the building. There are fewer examples of carnage that unfolded inside a piece of critical infrastructure that thousands of people depend on each day. While ridership on VTA’s three light rail lines dropped by over 70% during the pandemic, the system that extends from Mountain View to Milpitas to South San Jose remained a core piece of the South Bay’s public transit network. Many of those who have continued to ride public transportation through the pandemic do so because they don’t own cars and depend on buses and trains to get around. “I know we’ve got to respect the families, but we also have to respect the people that still (need) to go forward,” said Emily, a VTA rider who declined to give her last name as she stood at the Civic Center station a few blocks from the Guadalupe Yard on Tuesday. With no light rail train available, she was looking for a car on a ride-hailing app while her husband scanned the VTA bus map. Another rider said the lack of light rail service meant she had to take three different bus lines to get to work, adding an hour to her commute each way. VTA’s interim General Manager Evelynn Tran acknowledged in a statement Monday that public service would suffer while the agency tended to the emotional needs of its traumatized workforce. Asked whether the Amalgamated Transit Union — which represents nearly 1,600 VTA workers, including eight of the victims in last week’s shooting — was in talks about how to reopen the Guadalupe Yard, Arturo Aguilar, chairman of the union’s California Conference Board, declined to comment.

449,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/06/01/return-of-vta-light-rail-will-take-weeks-or-months-after-mass-shooting/,"Trending: It may take months to resume service on the Valley Transportation Authority’s light rail system following last week’s mass shooting that left 10 workers dead, an agency spokeswoman said Tuesday. The service was suspended indefinitely hours after a disgruntled maintenance worker opened fire last Wednesday morning at VTA’s light rail yard, killing nine of his coworkers before taking his own life. On Tuesday the agency discontinued the buses that were temporarily running along the light rail’s three lines — leaving transit riders to rely on the rest of the South Bay’s bus routes to get around. Now, both physically and emotionally, VTA faces a long, difficult and delicate task to get the trains that once carried over 25,000 riders each weekday running again. The Guadalupe Yard, which functions as the nerve center of the light rail network, is a crime scene. Traumatized VTA workers who survived the shooting have funerals to attend — and beyond that may be reluctant to return to the buildings where their friends were killed and they fled the sounds of gunfire. “There is no consideration of bringing light rail service back right now,” VTA spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said, with the agency instead focused on supporting the workers who lost colleagues. Light rail’s return “will be a matter of weeks or months, and not days,” she said. There is no timeline for when law enforcement investigators will turn the light rail yard — where trains are stored, serviced and dispatched — back to VTA, said Deputy Russell Davis, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office. It’s unclear how badly damaged the buildings are and what can — or must — be done to clean, repair, or relocate facilities that until Wednesday served as the hub of daily activity. “The whole system is run out of that light rail yard,” said Hendler Ross. During Wednesday’s rampage, 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy killed his colleagues in a maintenance building, then walked across the yard and continued shooting inside the three-story building that houses offices and VTA’s Operations Control Center. Employees have been able to retrieve their cars from the property, Davis said, but have not been allowed inside its buildings since the shooting. Hendler Ross said VTA officials are considering how they might be able to run the light rail system without using the Guadalupe Yard, because its operations control center can be moved to other VTA facilities. But she said that will be a challenge, because trains regularly need maintenance that must be done there. VTA is having to confront a question that Americans have grappled with at schools, workplaces, churches, shopping centers and countless other public spaces across the country: What do you do with the scene of a mass shooting? At Columbine High School in Colorado, Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and Umpqua Community College in Oregon, officials demolished and rebuilt the places where gunmen carried out massacres, according to The Washington Post. At Virginia Tech, a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, the Post reported buildings went through extensive renovations that ranged from several months to upwards of a year. There are some examples of mass shooting sites reopening quickly. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, held Sunday services four days after a 2015 massacre by a White supremacist gunman.

450,https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/miami-beach-police-questioning-rapper-dababy-shooting-78023925,"Grammy-nominated rapper DaBaby has been released after being questioned in a shooting that wounded two people in Miami MIAMI -- Grammy-nominated rapper DaBaby was detained for questioning in a shooting that wounded two people in Miami and later released, officials said Tuesday. Police said two suspects are now charged in the case. Jonathan Kirk, DaBaby's legal name, was one of many people being questioned by officials on Tuesday, Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said in a news release. Rodriguez had said earlier that “several possible suspects” were detained. He later noted that Kirk had been let go. According to arrest reports, Wisdom Awute, 21, and Christopher Urena, 29, both face charges of attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault. Urena also faces charges of grand theft and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. The shooting wrapped up a violent Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area. Police received multiple 911 calls reporting the shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. Police have not released the identities of those wounded. One was treated at a hospital and released, while the second remains in the hospital in critical condition. The shooting took place on Ocean Drive, a popular strip of restaurants and hotels in South Beach. During the investigation, the heavily traveled MacArthur Causeway nearby was shut down in both directions. DaBaby, 29, was arrested earlier this year in Los Angeles. Beverly Hills police said he took a loaded gun into an upscale store on Rodeo Drive. The North Carolina rapper’s song “Rockstar"" was one of the biggest hits of 2020, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year. No one responded immediately to an email sent to DaBaby’s representatives seeking comment. A man who answered the phone at the label company representing him said, “No comment.” In other violence over the weekend, a mass shooting outside a banquet hall early Sunday left two dead and 21 wounded, including three who were hospitalized in critical condition. Police did not release the victims’ names, citing privacy laws. A manhunt continued Tuesday for three masked suspects who opened fire outside El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah. On Monday, police released a surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing the hall. The SUV was found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of the shooting scene. Police said it had been reported stolen two weeks ago. The video shows three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two brandish what police described as “assault-style rifles.” Authorities said the suspects began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, but had specific targets in mind. Officials also are still investigating a drive-by shooting Friday night that killed a person and injured six others outside a venue in the the Wynwood area. Some witnesses likened the scene to a “war zone” after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying for cover. There is no indication the shootings were related to each other. “This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we’re here mourning,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Monday news conference. ———— Associated Press journalist Freida Frisaro in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-01 18:00:08,"Rapper DaBaby questioned in Miami Beach shooting, released",,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
451,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/06/01/i-got-the-subject-body-camera-footage-reveals-final-moments-of-vta-shooting/,"Trending: SAN JOSE — New body camera footage released Tuesday reveals the final eerie minutes of last week’s mass shooting at a light rail yard, showing law enforcement swarmed a building where a disgruntled employee of Valley Transportation Authority opened fire on his colleagues before killing himself. The footage — released by the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Department six days after Samuel James Cassidy, 57, shot and killed nine coworkers — comprises the first inside look at the deadliest rampage in Bay Area history, including the moment the team of first responders encountered the shooter, holding the gun he had shot himself with. “I see the gun in his hand. I see the gun in his hand,” one law enforcement agent shouts. “I got it — I got the subject,” another replies. The four-minute video starts around 6:37 a.m., as five agents prepared to head up the back staircase of the three-story office building where the shooter ended his rampage after killing several colleagues in a conference room across the VTA yard. Just two minutes had passed since the first call came in, according to Lieutenant Aaron Simonson.  VIDEO: Body camera footage captures police response to VTA mass shooting. WARNING: This video may disturb viewers. When the footage begins, what appears to be gun shots are heard as the agents — including three San Jose Police Department officers, one Sheriff’s deputy and one sergeant — cross the rail yard to approach the building. As the team heads up the staircase, a VTA supervisor escapes the building at the top of the stairs, handing over his key card to the agents to allow them access. “Come behind me, come behind me,” a deputy tells him. The team enters through a break room, passing by a refrigerator and a First Aid kit mounted to the wall before swinging into the main office area. Shining flashlights around the darkened office, they quickly begin to clear the room, briefly illuminating empty cubicles and computer screens that appeared to have been abandoned mid-task. Moments later, the sound of three more shots puncture the air. The video then shows the team of agents quickly bursting through a set of double doors, where they find the shooter sunken over an office chair in his signature blue jacket. The jacket he wore wasn’t part of his uniform but instead, a distinctive Carhartt safety coat that co-workers said had been his signature. As two agents swarm over Cassidy, grabbing his gun, the camera pans to the left, revealing a window that agents believe he had shot through just moments before. “I got the subject,” an agent calls out. Minutes later, Cassidy’s body would be placed on the roof of a police patrol car. In a press conference Tuesday — the first since the day of the shooting — Sheriff Laurie Smith said that she believes that Cassidy knew the team was closing in, prompting him to shoot himself twice, once in the chin and then in the side of the head, an account confirmed by the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s Office. “The autopsy concluded that the manner of death was suicide, and the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds of the head,” the office said in a statement late Tuesday. “Although rare, this can occur in suicides in which the first shot to the head was not immediately fatal.” At the press conference, Sheriff’s Office deputies described the contents of the video but largely sidestepped questions about Cassidy’s possible motive and red flags that could have alerted VTA or authorities to the threat earlier. The Federal Bureau of Investigations has handed the scene over to the Sheriff’s Office, which remains in charge of the investigation and has yet to return the site to VTA. Authorities have revealed little about the gunman’s possible motivations. VTA has yet to share any personnel records publicly, although the agency last week said that it would investigate any previous complaints about Cassidy, who apparently harbored longtime anger for the agency. Cassidy’s ex-wife said he spoke about killing coworkers, while an ex-girlfriend accused him of alcohol-fueled mood swings. In 2016, Customs and Border Patrol reportedly detained Cassidy on his way back from a trip to the Philippines, finding that he possessed books about terrorism and a memo book full of anti-VTA writing, according to the Wall Street Journal. Workers have described him as a misfit and “odd.” “Everybody thought he was just a little bit odd,” one worker told this news organization last week. “I had no idea he was dangerous but I’m not surprised either. There was something wrong with his wiring is the way I would describe it.” When asked directly whether the Sheriff’s Office had been alerted to the earlier federal detainment or any other information, Smith demurred Tuesday, saying “I don’t know” the nature of the threat that CBP identified. Instead, the sheriff focused her praise on the five first responders, saying she believes their implementation of the department’s active shooting protocol saved lives. “It was put into action by the sheriff’s office and San Jose police officers who hardly spoke a word to each other, they knew what their job was, they did their job and then confronted the suspect,” she said.

A gunman who killed nine co-workers at a Northern California rail yard shot himself twice in the head as sheriff's deputies raced into a building, according to authorities who on Tuesday released body-camera footage of the tense encounter. The nearly 4 1/2 minutes of footage is from one deputy who arrived minutes after the first shooting reports and while shots were still being fired at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, where 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy opened fire before killing himself. SANTA CLARITA SHOOTING: 2 FIREFIGHTERS SHOT, 1 KILLED BY OFF-DUTY COLLEAGUE: POLICE A ""contact team"" of deputies and San Jose police officers were immediately formed to find the gunman, who was reported to be inside a building and armed with a handgun. The body camera footage shows the team cautiously climbing stairs to the third floor, where a VTA supervisor comes out with arms raised and hands over his keycard so officers can get inside the building. The five-member team then sweeps into the building, guns raised, using gun-mounted flashlights as they pass through rooms and corridors to a dispatch center. Within minutes, they hear a gunshot, then another, followed by two more. As they come to another door, one of the team looks through a small window and says: ""I’ve got somebody down"" inside. The team opens the door and somebody shouts ""Let me see your hands!"" CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S DEPUTY DIES AFTER BEING SHOT DURING TRAFFIC STOP What might be two more shots are heard. The footage shows a man slumped in a chair near a stairwell with a gun in his hand. He is across from a dispatch center door with a window shattered by gunfire. GET THE FOX NEWS APP The gunman had shot himself under the chin then put the gun to the side of his head, the sheriff said. It wasn't clear whether Cassidy knew that law enforcement officers were closing in on him or not, but he may have seen their flashlights and heard them yelling to each other as they determined where the shooter and victims were as they moved through the building, Smith said. Smith said her office used an active shooter protocol advocated by a lieutenant who had been in Colorado during the 1999 Columbine school mass shooting there. Smith said law enforcement had been training together. The deputies and officers ""hardly spoke a word to each other"" when they entered the building because ""they knew what their job was,"" she said, adding that they showed extraordinary courage. ""There were over 100 VTA employees on site that morning, and I believe the bravery of all of law enforcement personnel really prevented the loss of additional life,"" she said.\ A VTA spokeswoman told the Mercury News in San Jose that it may take weeks or months to resume service on the commuter rail line. The Guadalupe Yard operates as the nerve center of the light rail network and is now a crime scene under sheriff's department control. Spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said the agency is focused on supporting traumatized workers who lost colleagues. The footage was released as a new FBI report finds that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, a figure that aligns with its population, the report found. It also came as an off-duty Los Angeles County firefighter fatally shot and killed one colleague and injured another before taking his own life. The sheriff said investigators were still trying to determine the motive for the shootings, although acquaintances and his ex-wife said Cassidy had talked about hating his job at least a decade ago and had an angry and unpredictable streak. ""We're beginning to piece things together. But we've talked with hundreds of witnesses,"" Smith said.

455,https://www.nationalmemo.com/biden-pride-anti-trans-violence-,"President Joe Biden Reprinted with permission from American Independent Killings of transgender and gender nonconforming people in 2021 are occurring at a far faster pace than in previous years. The violence has not gone without mention by the White House: President Joe Biden has marked the start of LGBTQ Pride Month with a proclamation that brings attention to the issue. The proclamation, which was published on Tuesday, celebrates progress in the fight for equality while recognizing how far LGBTQ people are from winning full legal protections and greater safety from violence: Referring to the killing in a mass shooting of 53 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, the proclamation says, ""Our nation also continues to face tragic levels of violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color. And we are still haunted by tragedies such as the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando. Ending violence and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community demands our continued focus and diligence. As President, I am committed to defending the rights of all LGBTQ+ individuals."" This is not the first time Biden has mentioned publicly violence against transgender women of color. During his campaign for president in October 2020, he said during a town hall broadcast on ABC News, ""There should be zero discrimination. And what's happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They're being murdered."" This year, at least 27 transgender and gender nonconforming people have been killed, according to the Human Rights Campaign, on track to surpass 2020's high of at least 44 recorded violent deaths of transgender and gender nonconforming people, the highest number since HRC began tracking in 2013. At this point in 2020, 13 such killings had occurred. According to a report released by HRC in 2020, 84% of the victims of such killings in the last seven years were transgender women. Sixty-six percent were Black transgender women. Biden's recognition of Pride Month is very different from Donald Trump's approach when he was in office. In 2017, 2018, and 2020, Trump failed to recognize Pride Month in any way, NBC News reported. He published a tweet about Pride Month in 2019 that was later republished as an official White House statement, but he never issued an official presidential proclamation on Pride Month. Trump's tweet read, ""As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions that LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation. My Administration has launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality and invites all nations to join us in this effort!"" People involved in movements to decriminalize homosexuality across the globe told Mother Jones in 2019 that nothing really came of the campaign except a few panel discussions that were held in Europe. According to the Washington Blade, Melania Trump planned to light up the White House in LGBTQ Pride flag colors in June of 2020 but was stopped from doing so. Mark Meadows, who was then Donald Trump's chief of staff and has a history of public opposition to LGBTQ rights, is said to have been the White House's failure to express solidarity with LGBTQ people. The Trump administration attacked LGBTQ equality with rules to keep transgender women out of homeless shelters, remove nondiscrimination protections for transgender students, gut Obama-era guards against anti-LGBTQ discrimination in health care, and implement a ban on service in the military by transgender people. It continued to fight LGBTQ rights even in its last few weeks in power. The Biden administration has worked to reverse much of the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda since its first day in office. Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation.

457,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/motive-unclear-firefighter-kills-colleague-station-78033972,"A Los Angeles County firefighter appeared to have a longstanding job-related dispute with the co-worker he fatally shot at their rural fire station this week SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- A Los Angeles County firefighter appeared to have a longstanding job-related dispute with the colleague he fatally shot at their small, rural fire station in what was California’s second deadly workplace shooting in less than a week, authorities said Wednesday. The gunman also critically wounded a fire captain at the station about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Los Angeles on Tuesday before setting his house on fire in a nearby community and apparently killing himself, officials said. Preliminary interviews with other employees at Fire Station 81 indicate the shooter and the fellow veteran firefighter who was killed had “some workplace beef,” said Los Angeles County sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean, who is overseeing the homicide investigation. “It sounds like they didn’t like each other,” Dean told The Associated Press, without elaborating. He said investigators will review the Fire Department's personnel files to see if any official complaints had been made or disciplinary actions had been taken before the bloodshed. It was not immediately clear how long the two had worked together at the station in Agua Dulce, a rural community of about 3,000 people in the desert of northern Los Angeles County. The coroner’s office on Wednesday identified the firefighter who died as Tory Carlon, a 44-year-old fire specialist who drove the fire engine. He was shot several times in the upper torso, authorities said. Carlon had three daughters and had been with the department for more than 20 years. Hundreds of people honored him at a vigil Tuesday night at a park near the station, remembering him as a devoted father and committed firefighter who mentored younger colleagues. “Together with all Californians, we mourn the tragic and senseless loss of a brave and dedicated firefighter and community leader whose selfless service will not be forgotten,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement Wednesday. Authorities say the gunman was off-duty when he went to the fire station and began shooting, authorities said. He then drove to his house and set it on fire. As police swarmed the area, he was found dead in an empty pool. It’s believed he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, sheriff’s officials said. Investigators seized a handgun at the home. The 54-year-old fire captain who was wounded was in critical but stable condition. He is expected to survive, Dean said. Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the captain had previously been a deputy before transferring to the Fire Department. Detectives believe the captain, who wasn’t identified, heard the shooting and went to find the source of the gunfire. It wasn’t clear if he tried to intervene or the attacker turned the gun on him, Dean said. The gunman was 45-year-old fire specialist Jonathan Tatone, the coroner’s office said. Property records show Tatone owned the home that burned in the community of Acton, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the fire station. He bought it last July. Tatone was a county firefighter since at least 2012, according to public payroll and pension records kept by Transparent California. Fire Department officials did not immediately release more details about his employment. The small station where the shooting occurred — one of 172 throughout Los Angeles County — has only four firefighters per shift and 12 total assigned to it. Employees typically work 24 hours at a time and sleep at the station. Tuesday's shooting occurred less than a week after Samuel Cassidy, 57, opened fire at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, killing nine of his co-workers and then himself as law enforcement closed in. He had rigged his home to burn before heading to his longtime workplace. Cassidy had a short fuse at times and a longtime grudge against his workplace, but the exact motive for the shooting was under investigation. Body camera footage from a Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy who went into a building as shots were being fired was         released Tuesday. ——— Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this story. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-02 01:11:47,Motive unclear as firefighter kills colleague at station,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
458,https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-survived-the-parkland-massacre-gen-z-we-need-your-help?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH David Hogg and Sam Fuentes, who survived the Parkland mass shooting that killed 17 people, write about how it’ll be up to Gen Z to tackle America’s epidemic of gun violence. We are of Gen Z. We knew each other best from astronomy class our senior year of high school in a somewhat “average,” largely white, upper-middle-class American town. We were normal-ass kids doing normal-ass things when, on Valentine’s Day 2018, a shooter came into our school killing 17, and our lives were never to be the same again. That day, I, Sam, was shot multiple times with an AR-15 in Holocaust studies class and witnessed my classmates murdered in front of me. Since then, I have spent my time evolving through PTSD and finding my voice as a gun violence prevention activist and artist. I, David, was also a student at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School. That day in lockdown, texting in the dark, my sister, a freshman, lost four of her friends. In the days that followed, while Sam faced what would be a lifetime of recovery from wounds both physical and emotional, me and my classmates founded the March For Our Lives movement that catalyzed school walkouts across the country and one of the largest youth protests in American history. Today, we are both college students navigating the everyday challenges of 21-year-old life while trying to be the voices of our friends slain on 2/14/18—along with the more than 1,800 youngsters across the nation who lose their lives each year to gun violence. While we look forward to experiencing some sense of “normal, non-virtual life” when we return to school in the fall after quarantining from an unprecedented pandemic, we worry about the chance of random gunfire in our classrooms, movie theaters, supermarkets, and other public spaces. In just the first four months of 2021, there have been over 160 mass shootings. As mass shooting survivors, we make up less than 2 percent of kids lost to gun violence—now the largest killer of America’s youth. But our peers in Black and brown communities are 14 times more likely to die from guns, and they have been fighting to have their voices heard in this battle for years. As our film Us Kids illustrates, we came together, along with hundreds of thousands of other young people, with a common denominator of trauma and a desperate plea to change the maddening narrative of complacency toward the epidemic of gun violence in our country. We are traumatized and, yes, angry. Statistically speaking, when it comes to guns and dead kids, our lives are cheap compared to those of kids in other economically developed countries. As a society, we’ve managed in the past to address other issues that threaten the safety of youth—drunk driving, drinking, and smoking, to name a few—and while we press for our federal government to enact sensible and crucial gun-reform laws that will save lives, we know that public apathy is perhaps our greatest enemy. Partisan gridlock on the federal level means that we need to go hyperlocal and focus on our own backyards, on laws at state and local levels, on intergenerational dialogue—supporting kids with boots on the ground, and most importantly looking at the intersectional roots of why gun violence happens in the first place. Our experience of working on this documentary and reclaiming our narrative permanently altered our understanding of the role systemic injustice plays in the creation of gun violence. We must have a much broader conversation around gun violence as a symptom of racial inequality, white supremacy, and economic inequality. We need to hear more stories from kids who are disproportionately affected by guns on a daily basis. While the adult population may become increasingly numb with each new shooting that hits the news, kids do not have that luxury. We face paralyzing anxiety over this and so many other issues that threaten our futures, and we become more traumatized and more enraged with each triggering incident. We have to take a harder look at the causes of our failure to respond to this crisis. We’re sick of the dysfunction that results in inaction. We’re sick of the greed, inefficiency, stupidity, and selfishness of so many of our elected. Yes, the system is broken, but until we figure out how to fix the filibuster and everything else, let’s get stuff done. That’s why we turned out in record numbers for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 general election (with youth in BIPOC communities at its highest numbers, by the way), and that is precisely why we need Gen Z to exceed that in the 2022 midterms and beyond—to continue to keep gun violence at the forefront of voting priorities. But we also need our political engagement to go beyond the voting booth, so that we can combat the injustices of which gun violence is a symptom. “You either have to become optimistically nihilistic or blissfully ignorant” is a line delivered in the latter part of our film. Another from me, Sam: “I think the world’s gone to shit… but I do think people in the world will get better.” We are counting on Gen Z to be those people. We have the power of time, and kids don’t tend to relent. Us Kids are not going away.",2021-06-02 04:56:44,"We Survived the Parkland Massacre.

459,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/police-release-dramatic-body-cam-video-rail-yard-78031355,"Newly released body camera footage shows that a gunman who killed nine co-workers at a Northern California rail yard shot himself twice in the head as sheriff’s deputies raced into a building New details about suspected San Jose shooter who killed 9 SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A gunman who killed nine co-workers at a Northern California rail yard shot himself twice in the head as sheriff's deputies raced into a building, according to authorities who on Tuesday released body-camera footage of the tense encounter. The nearly 4 1/2 minutes of footage is from one deputy who arrived minutes after the first shooting reports and while shots were still being fired at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, where 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy opened fire before killing himself. A “contact team” of deputies and San Jose police officers was immediately formed to find the gunman, who was reported to be inside a building and armed with a handgun. The         body camera footage shows the team cautiously climbing stairs to the third floor, where a VTA supervisor comes out with arms raised and hands over his keycard so officers can get inside the building. The five-member team then sweeps into the building, guns raised, using gun-mounted flashlights as they pass through rooms and corridors to a dispatch center. Within minutes, they hear a gunshot, then another, followed by two more. As they come to another door, one of the team looks through a small window and says: “I’ve got somebody down” inside. The team opens the door and somebody shouts “Let me see your hands!” What might be two more shots are heard. The footage shows a man slumped in a chair near a stairwell with a gun in his hand. He is across from a dispatch center door with a window shattered by gunfire. The gunman had shot himself under the chin then put the gun to the side of his head, the sheriff said. It wasn't clear whether Cassidy knew that law enforcement officers were closing in on him or not, but he may have seen their flashlights and heard them yelling to each other as they determined where the shooter and victims were as they moved through the building, Smith said. Smith said her office used an active shooter protocol advocated by a lieutenant who had been in Colorado during the 1999 Columbine school mass shooting there. Smith said law enforcement had been training together. The deputies and officers “hardly spoke a word to each other"" when they entered the building because “they knew what their job was,” she said, adding that they showed extraordinary courage. “There were over 100 VTA employees on site that morning, and I believe the bravery of all of law enforcement personnel really prevented the loss of additional life,"" she said. A VTA spokeswoman told the Mercury News in San Jose that it may take weeks or months to resume service on the commuter rail line. The Guadalupe Yard operates as the nerve center of the light rail network and is now a crime scene under sheriff's department control. Spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said the agency is focused on supporting traumatized workers who lost colleagues. The footage was released as a new         FBI report finds that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, a figure that aligns with its population, the report found. It also came as an off-duty          Los Angeles County firefighter fatally shot and killed one colleague and injured another before taking his own life. The sheriff said investigators were still trying to determine the motive for the shootings, although acquaintances and his ex-wife said Cassidy had talked about hating his job at least a decade ago and had an angry and unpredictable streak. “We're beginning to piece things together. But we've talked with hundreds of witnesses,"" Smith said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-02 00:14:35,Police release dramatic body-cam video of rail yard shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

          / CBS/AP Grammy-nominated rapper DaBaby was one of several people detained for questioning after a double shooting late Monday night outside a popular steakhouse in South Beach that led to two arrests, CBS Miami reports. Miami Beach Police said Tuesday that DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, had been released. According to arrest reports, Wisdom Awute, 21, and Christopher Urena, 29, both face charges of attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault. Urena also faces charges of grand theft and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. The shooting wrapped up a violent Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area. Police received multiple 911 calls reporting the shooting at just after 11:30 p.m. Monday at the Prime 112 restaurant on Ocean Drive, CBS Miami says. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. Police haven't released the identities of those wounded. One was treated at a hospital and released, while the second remains in the hospital in critical condition. The shooting took place on Ocean Drive, a popular strip of restaurants and hotels in South Beach. During the investigation, the heavily traveled MacArthur Causeway nearby was shut down in both directions. ""All of a sudden it was just, 'pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,'"" Riaan Dadewet told CBS Miami. He described it as a war zone. ""It was just gunfire everywhere. I think it was like 25 to 30 shots,"" he said. ""We ran up to our room, looked out our balcony, and saw one of the victims that was shot in the leg, they took off running down in this area,"" Reed McLean, who is visiting from New York, remarked to CBS Miami. According to the staiton, which cited police, Urena took off in a stolen vehicle after shooting a victim. Awute, himself a rapper, chased down other people who were running away toward a nearby park and shot one of them in the leg. DaBaby, 29, was arrested earlier this year in Los Angeles. Beverly Hills police said he took a loaded gun into an upscale store on Rodeo Drive. The North Carolina rapper's song ""Rockstar"" was one of the biggest hits of 2020 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year. In other violence over the weekend, a mass shooting outside a banquet hall early Sunday left two dead and 21 wounded, including three who were hospitalized in critical condition. Police didn't release the victims' names, citing privacy laws. A manhunt continued Tuesday for the three masked suspects who opened fire outside El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah. On Monday, police released  surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing the hall. The SUV was found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles east of the shooting scene. Police said it had been reported stolen two weeks ago. The video shows three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two brandish what police described as ""assault-style rifles."" Authorities said the suspects began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd but had specific targets in mind. Officials also are still investigating a drive-by shooting Friday night that killed a person and injured six others outside a venue in the the Wynwood area. Some witnesses likened the scene to a ""war zone"" after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying for cover. There is no indication the shootings were related to each other. ""This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we're here mourning,"" Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Monday news conference.

Gavin Newsom spoke for California and the nation when he said, “What the hell is wrong with us?” Newsom, of course, was in San Jose on Wednesday when he asked this basic question. The governor was speaking about the unspeakable, again. He was standing with another group of devastated people after a mass shooting, again. “What the hell is going on in the United States of America?” Newsom asked. “When are we going to come to grips with this? When are we going to put down our arms — literally and figuratively — our politics, stale rhetoric, finger-pointing, all the hand wringing, consternation that produces nothing except more fury and frustration … over and over and over again.” These are urgent questions about the soul of our nation, and the feeble answers we barely muster each time are almost as tragic as the unrelenting spree of mass shootings in our communities. These should be once-in-century massacres but they have become routine, expected, and quickly surpassed by other, lesser, stories until the next massacre. Is it true that all we can do is shrug? Is it true that all we can do is type “thoughts and prayers” into our Twitter feeds? What the hell is wrong with Americans? Nine people were murdered in their workplace on Wednesday morning by a co-worker with a violent past, at the Valley Transportation Authority in the heart of Silicon Valley, in one of the wealthiest counties in California. This abomination happened in a reliably blue city in a state boasting some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation. National Public Radio reported on May 10 that there had already been 194 mass shootings in the first 18 weeks of 2021, about 10 a week. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as gun violence where at least four people are killed or wounded at one time, tabulated 610 mass shootings in 2020. It’s noteworthy that while Newsom identified the right questions we should be asking ourselves as Americans awash in the blood of our neighbors, friends, family, and co-workers, he didn’t promote any particular gun control policy. In truth, this American proclivity for gun violence is bigger than any gun control measure, though more are surely needed. The San Jose gunman, Samuel Cassidy, allegedly had a history of domestic violence. According to the Giffords Law Center, domestic violence and gun violence are tragically intertwined. California is one of 17 states that prohibits domestic violence misdemeanants from possessing guns. California also is one of 17 states that authorizes or requires the surrender of guns or ammunition after conviction of a domestic violence misdemeanor. But, according to the Giffords Law Center, California is not among the four states that go a step further: enacting laws “designed to ensure records regarding domestic violence crimes that fall within the federal definition of a ‘misdemeanor crime of domestic violence’ are submitted to the federal and/or state databases used for firearm purchaser background checks.” But here is the rub: It’s unclear if Cassidy was ever convicted of domestic violence, despite the harrowing record of domestic violence claims in his past cited by Bay Area news outlets.

A firefighter killed a co-worker and wounded another at their small fire station before setting his own home ablaze and apparently killing himself in California's second deadly workplace shooting in days. The gunman, a firefighter specialist and engineer, was off-duty when he apparently drove the 10 miles from his home in Acton, north of Los Angeles, and opened fire Tuesday morning at Los Angeles County Fire Station 81, authorities said. The killer ""was not scheduled to work today. He came back and confronted the on-duty personnel,"" a visibly shaken Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters. ""I cannot speak to the mindset of the shooter."" The chief also said he didn't know about any disciplinary actions involving the gunman, who wasn't immediately identified.

The father of three daughters had been with the department for more than 20 years, Osby said. A 54-year-old fire captain who also was shot in the upper body underwent surgery and was in critical but stable condition at a hospital. The gunman then returned to his house, which authorities found engulfed in flames. He was later found dead in an empty pool of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot, since nobody else was at the home and deputies didn't open fire, sheriff's officials said. Helicopters fought the blaze because it was considered unsafe to send firefighters into the home, which burned for hours. A SWAT team and a bomb squad were sent in before firefighters were finally allowed to use hoses on the gutted ruins. The fire station is in Agua Dulce, a rural community of about 3,000 people in the desert of northern Los Angeles County known for its rock formations and panoramic views. Osby said the station has only four firefighters per shift and was considered a home by workers who typically work there 24 hours at a time. ""As a fire chief, I never thought that when our firefighters face danger, that they would face danger in one of our community fire stations,"" Osby said. County Supervisor Janice Hahn said firefighters risk their lives daily. ""Between emergency calls, the fire station must have felt like their safe haven,"" she said.

467,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/us/san-jose-mayor-shooting.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today Wednesday: “Mayors don’t have the luxury of offering prayers and platitudes,” Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose said. By Jill Cowan Good morning. A week ago, a gunman opened fire at a San Jose rail yard, killing nine of his colleagues before apparently killing himself. Some eight miles away, the gunman’s home had been set ablaze. Although officials are still trying to piece together exactly what happened that morning and why — a task that may never really be complete — the details that have emerged are gutting, in part because they were predictable in a nation where such mass shootings have become a numbing routine. The gunman had for years complained about his job at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, telling his ex-wife that he wished he could kill his co-workers and writing about his hatred for the agency in a notebook once flagged by border officials as he returned from a trip. He was described by colleagues, neighbors and former partners as an emotionally volatile, likely mentally ill loner. Victims’ loved ones described the shattering sudden loss of parents, spouses and friends who were merely starting an ordinary work day when they were killed. This wasn’t the first time San Jose’s mayor, Sam Liccardo, had been called upon to comfort community members grieving for loved ones killed in a mass shooting. In 2019, “we lost two children,” he told me on Tuesday, referring to the deaths of two young city residents during a shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Now, as then, Liccardo said, the first priority has been to ensure that survivors and families have access to counseling and support. But he said he also feels urgency to enact policies that might stem the tide of gun violence — even if long-sought federal gun control legislation has been elusive. “Mayors don’t have the luxury of offering prayers and platitudes,” he said. “People expect concrete actions.” To that end, Liccardo said, he hoped the San Jose City Council would approve, by the end of the year, a first-in-the-nation requirement that gun owners in the city insure their weapons or pay fees to keep them. The idea, he explained, is that guns are contributing to a public health crisis — and it’s expensive. Liccardo said that requiring drivers to carry auto insurance has helped cut down on fatalities from car crashes, so having the private insurance industry get involved would help incentivize responsible gun ownership and defray the cost of gun violence to taxpayers, who pay for emergency and law enforcement services. The mayor first proposed the idea in 2019 in the wake of the Gilroy shooting, but he said the pandemic delayed progress on the measure. “We were working with an epidemiologist at the county, so we put that aside,” he said. “Now, I think we’re ready to come back.” Of course, gun laws at every level have faced intense and sustained legal challenges. Liccardo told me he’s “not delusional” about the fact that a gun regulation ordinance would require a vigorous legal defense. But he said that city-level policy changes could provide ideas that Congress and even the state legislature would not be nimble enough to enact. “No one would say that it would be ideal for each city to come up with its own policies,” he said. “But we recognize that cities can be laboratories for policy innovation.” For more: Here’s a look at what we know about the shooting.

468,https://www.aol.com/news/police-release-dramatic-body-cam-022329242-123737816.html," SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — A gunman who killed nine co-workers at a Northern California rail yard shot himself twice in the head as sheriff's deputies raced into a building, according to authorities who on Tuesday released body-camera footage of the tense encounter. The nearly 4 1/2 minutes of footage is from one deputy who arrived minutes after the first shooting reports and while shots were still being fired at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, where 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy opened fire before killing himself. A “contact team” of deputies and San Jose police officers was immediately formed to find the gunman, who was reported to be inside a building and armed with a handgun. The body camera footage shows the team cautiously climbing stairs to the third floor, where a VTA supervisor comes out with arms raised and hands over his keycard so officers can get inside the building. The five-member team then sweeps into the building, guns raised, using gun-mounted flashlights as they pass through rooms and corridors to a dispatch center. Within minutes, they hear a gunshot, then another, followed by two more. As they come to another door, one of the team looks through a small window and says: “I’ve got somebody down” inside. The team opens the door and somebody shouts “Let me see your hands!” What might be two more shots are heard. The footage shows a man slumped in a chair near a stairwell with a gun in his hand. He is across from a dispatch center door with a window shattered by gunfire. The gunman had shot himself under the chin then put the gun to the side of his head, the sheriff said. It wasn't clear whether Cassidy knew that law enforcement officers were closing in on him or not, but he may have seen their flashlights and heard them yelling to each other as they determined where the shooter and victims were as they moved through the building, Smith said. Smith said her office used an active shooter protocol advocated by a lieutenant who had been in Colorado during the 1999 Columbine school mass shooting there. Smith said law enforcement had been training together. The deputies and officers “hardly spoke a word to each other"" when they entered the building because “they knew what their job was,” she said, adding that they showed extraordinary courage. “There were over 100 VTA employees on site that morning, and I believe the bravery of all of law enforcement personnel really prevented the loss of additional life,"" she said. A VTA spokeswoman told the Mercury News in San Jose that it may take weeks or months to resume service on the commuter rail line. The Guadalupe Yard operates as the nerve center of the light rail network and is now a crime scene under sheriff's department control. Spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said the agency is focused on supporting traumatized workers who lost colleagues. The footage was released as a new FBI report finds that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, a figure that aligns with its population, the report found. It also came as an off-duty  Los Angeles County firefighter fatally shot and killed one colleague and injured another before taking his own life. The sheriff said investigators were still trying to determine the motive for the shootings, although acquaintances and his ex-wife said Cassidy had talked about hating his job at least a decade ago and had an angry and unpredictable streak. “We're beginning to piece things together.

According to arrest reports, Wisdom Awute, 21, and Christopher Urena, 29, both face charges of attempted first-degree murder with a deadly weapon and aggravated assault. Urena also faces charges of grand theft and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Police received multiple 911 calls reporting the shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday along the popular strip of Art Deco hotels and restaurants. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where one remains in critical condition and the other was treated and released. Grammy-nominated rapper DaBaby was one of many people detained for questioning in the Ocean Drive shooting before police let him go, Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said. DaBaby — whose legal name is Jonathan Kirk — had one of the biggest hits of 2020 with “Rockstar,” and was nominated for a Grammy Award for record of the year. A man answering the phone at his record label said “No comment.” The shooting wrapped up a violent Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area. A mass shooting by three masked suspects outside a banquet hall near Hialeah early Sunday left two dead and 21 wounded, including three who were hospitalized in critical condition. And a drive-by shooting Friday night killed one person and injured six others outside a venue in the the Wynwood area. There is no indication the shootings were related to each other. “This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we’re here mourning,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday. ———— Associated Press journalist Freida Frisaro in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-02 09:33:01,2 charged in Miami Beach; no arrests in other shootings,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

(Photo by: Joan ... [+] Slatkin/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) It’s a daily outrage, the news of our land. A mass shooting happens almost daily. Dozens of states are trying to further suppress those who have been long oppressed, ironically accompanied by denial that racism exists. Facts and truth are ignored in favor of fabricated absurdities that politicians propagate to hold power and people believe in order to belong. While the planet keeps heating up, hackers keep reminding us of our fragility and fascism keeps spreading around the world. Meanwhile, leaders committed to making a positive difference are recovering from the Covid-exposed fault lines in their systems and processes and trying to recharge their people and reimagine their businesses. Phew! If all we see is the mess of things, this is an exhausting time. Moreover, we will have a hard time building resonance around our ideas and inspiring others if we’re operating from outrage. Which is why we do well to heed the wisdom succinctly captured by Joseph Campbell in the Power of Myth, “All great wisdom traditions agree on one thing,” he said. “Everything’s a mess and all is well.” Leaders do well to penetrate both sides of this truth, not to ignore the mess with a rose-colored bypass, but to deeply understand the forces perfectly holding the mess in place and embrace—with love, compassion and wisdom—the whole picture in which this worldly drama plays out. That kind of bigness is up to the task of this time and can do inexhaustible good without exhaustion. While the mess of things is easy to see, how can we possibly say, “All is well” as we look at our organizations, country or world today? Certainly, at the surface, we can see problems everywhere, and our motivation to make a difference often comes from the fact that all is not well. But let me offer two other ways of looking along a different dimension. The first is to penetrate the forces underlying the mess, especially the parts we have to deal with or may be in a position to address. What we will find is that every outrage is the natural result of the causes before it and conditions in which it arose. In the sense of following the laws of nature, it’s perfect. It may look horrible from your perspective or mine, but ours is a snapshot in time from one node in a vast swirling network of cause and effect. We have no idea what that will lead to. It may be that today’s outrage is exactly the cause that inspires the next generation of leaders to remake more conscious businesses or government. We don’t know. But in penetrating to the forces underlying surface issues, we see the forces of human nature we’re working with, where people are acting out of fear, what those fears are based in, and how they’re being fueled. All of which gives us insight into how we might add value or lead people to a better place. For example, American democracy is in something of a mess with a sizeable percentage of our population believing that the election was stolen despite all facts to the contrary. Penetrating to the forces underlying their belief, we can see emotion trumping logic—as it does in most humans—and that it’s more important to feel belonging to a group that shares their grievances than it does to find truth or shed those grievances. We can sense their fear of losing something—surely we know that fear as well. Seeing at this depth, some of our outrage gives way to empathy. We can think of people close to us, in our families, on our teams, and how they, too, are pulled by these fears. As leaders, we’re reminded of the importance of emotion and creating a sense of belonging. When people are upset, we know it won’t work to pull out a spreadsheet of facts and numbers and start explaining. When people are afraid of losing what they’ve had, we can help them feel a part of what is and what can be. By penetrating outrage to its more neutral sources, we see more clearly how to help people in our own world. The second direction from which we can sense “everything’s a mess and all is well” is to rise above the surface or transcend the playing field of everyday life and, in a sense, become the whole picture. This sense of oneness or Samadhi reveals a boundless aspect to our being and reframes leadership to the bigness of Zen Leadership. Far from making us complacent, it gives us a sense of ownership and care for the whole picture, just as we might care for our own eyes. But it’s not a frantic caring that has to fix everything that looks messy from a particular perspective, because it’s not locked into a particular perspective. Rather it feels into the energies at play, the forces at work, what’s ready to change, what’s not ready to change and inspires acts of wisdom. Becoming the whole picture may well start as an act of imagination. You might try it now, imagining yourself as your entire company, the whole expansive community you serve, both political parties, the entire country, the whole planet. Can you feel how at each level, the way you would look at things, the decisions you’d make, and what you’d care for would change? While this may start as an act of imagination, since this wholeness is also a truth of your being, alongside your local, seemingly separate ego, do this enough and it becomes your own lived experience. To cultivate these perspectives—penetration and transcendence—you may have your own way, but the best way I know is meditation. By physically slowing down our breathing, making the exhale especially long and slow, we slow down fundamental frequencies in the body, including the rate of thought, to the point where we can see through our own reactivity and penetrate to insight. We can see through our outrage to the chains of cause and effect that manifest as messes at the surface. Deep, slow breathing regulated by the hara (i.e., lower abdomen) also cultivates the condition of Samadhi and, quite literally, gut-level intuition. However, we go about it, being able to see beneath and beyond the mess of things is crucial to maintain the sensitivity and positivity that inspires others to follow us or creates enduring value. Moreover, we need it for our own wellbeing. It’s no coincidence that the very reframe that invites us into a deeper and bigger perspective makes us less fragile ourselves. When we can live into both sides of “everything’s a mess and all is well,” we lead as a force of nature, not apart from nature, healing whatever part of the mess around us is ready to be well.

476,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/06/02/san-jose-shooting-body-camera-footage/1921622642572/,"June 2 (UPI) -- Authorities have yet to announce a motive in the mass shooting last week at a rail yard in San Jose, Calif., that killed nine people, but they have released police body camera footage taken during the attack. At a news conference Tuesday night, Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office released footage that showed the final minutes before authorities found gunman Samuel James Cassidy, who'd shot himself.
Advertisement The four-minute video begins as officers climb a staircase at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority's three-story office building. As police enter the main office area, gunshots can be heard. Two officers are seen moving toward Cassidy's body and grabbing his gun. Asked about a possible motive at the news conference, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said the investigation is ongoing. Cassidy had worked at the transit agency.
RELATED 12 firearms, 22K rounds of ammunition found at San Jose shooter's home, police say She praised five law enforcement officers who first responded and said their following active shooting protocol saved lives. ""It was put into action by the sheriff's office and San Jose police officers who hardly spoke a word to each other, they knew what their job was, they did their job and then confronted the suspect,"" Smith said, according to The Mercury News. Smith said it's likely Cassidy knew police were closing in and that caused him to shoot himself twice, in the chin and the side of the head.
RELATED Deaths in San Jose, Calif., shooting rise to 10; police search for motive An autopsy found the manner of Cassidy's death was suicide. Multiple gunshots can occur in suicides in which the first shot to the head is not immediately fatal, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner's Office said in a statement. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that U.S. Customs officers detained Cassidy, 57, after a 2016 trip to the Philippines and had found books on terrorism in his possession, and a notebook expressing hatred for the transit agency. Federal officials did not contact the transit agency or law enforcement, the Journal reported.

[+] store owners on Long Island have been selling out of firearms as scores of customers fear a rise in violence as the pandemic escalates in the area. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a total of 3.22 million background checks in May 2021, meaning that 2021 is on track to break last year’s record for data partly based on gun purchases. “Today our clients are buying anything that is not nailed down, and if it is nailed down some are bringing pry bars,” said Clay Ausley, who owns Fuquay Gun & Gold in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. “We are selling whatever we can get in stock and pretty much as quickly as it comes in, it typically goes right back out.” The FBI tally for May 2021 is down 8% from 3.51 million in the prior month of April 2021. But it’s up 4% from 3.09 million in May 2020. So while the momentum of background checks is slowing from its frenetic pace earlier this year, it’s still well ahead of last year’s record performance. “Year to date it has been our best year on record, surpassing 2020 which was a record breaker for my business and industry,” said Ausley. The FBI data implies that Americans are continuing to buy firearms and ammunition at unprecedented rates. The background checks are conducted primarily when people are buying, or attempting to buy, guns at a gun store. While background checks are not the same as sales, the federal data serves as the closest nationwide proxy for gun sales. Last year’s record annual tally was 39.69 million for all of 2020. The first five months of 2021 adds up to 19.18 million. That’s an increase of 25% compared to 15.24 million during the first five months of 2020. So even if the pace continues to slow throughout the year, 2021 could still easily trounce last year’s record for background checks. “The continued record level of background checks for firearm sales demonstrates that Americans are voting with their wallets when it comes to firearm ownership and their Second Amendment rights,” said Mark Oliva, public affairs director for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry group. Gun sales have surged since the coronavirus pandemic swept through America in March 2020, flattening the economy, killing hundreds of thousands of people and putting tens of millions of people out of work. But the gun and ammunition industry has been a bright spot in the economy. Americans continue to buy guns produced by Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger 
 
RGR
, and ammunition produced by Vista Outdoor and Olin, Inc., amid outbreaks of civil unrest and rising crime in major cities, including hate crimes versus Asian-Americans. The industry is fueled by at least eight million first-time gun buyers, according to data from the NSSF and recent comments from Jason Vanderbrink, president of ammunition for Vista Outdoor. “These eight million new buyers, many of whom are women and people of color, bring true new demand to this market,” said Vanderbrink during Vista’s investor day online event on May 26. Unprecedented demand for guns and ammunition has outstripped supply, leading to bare shelves in the ammunition aisles in gun stores around the country. Late last year, Vista acquired an ammo factory from bankrupt Remington to supply the intense demand, and the company plans to launch a monthly ammunition subscription service. “When it comes to ammunition, we are still in a very difficult situation,” said Ausley. “Ammunition prices are the highest I have ever seen them and still nearly impossible to keep in stock. The firearms industry, much like everything else in 2021 has, experienced drastic price increases and we are getting more cost increases daily, but this has not slowed sales at all.” Americans seeking self-protection are buying handguns, particularly compact semiautomatic pistols. The ever-popular Glock is difficult to keep in stock, according to gun retailers. Popular pistols include the M&P Shield EZ line of guns from Smith & Wesson, the LCP brand from Sturm, Ruger, the G3 brand from Taurus, the 320 brand from Sig Sauer and the 911 line from Springfield Armory. Gun buyers are also trying to stay ahead of the gun control plans of President Joseph Biden, a Democrat and gun owner who intends to crack down on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He faces a daunting challenge because he would have to get an assault weapon bill passed by Congress with only a slim Democratic majority. The call for more restrictive gun control grows louder with every mass shooting, and there have been 243 mass shootings year-to-date, according to the Gun Violence Archive.  The month of May culminated in two mass shootings. On May 26 in San Jose, California, a gunman killed eight co-workers and then killed himself at a union meeting at a rail yard for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority. On May 30 in Miami-Dade, three gunmen with handguns and semiautomatic rifles shot into a crowd outside a rap concert, and some of the people armed themselves and shot back, leaving two dead and 21 wounded. Assault rifles have been used in many mass shootings, along with high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, so they’re a prime target for gun control supporters. Assault weapon restrictions would focus on semiautomatic assault weapons, which are legal in most states. Assault weapons, which the industry prefers to call modern sporting rifles, are made by Smith & Wesson, Sturm, Ruger, Sig Sauer, HK, Daniel Defense, Noveske, CMMG, Springfield Armory and Franklin Armory, to name a few. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 18,277 people have died from gun violence in America year to date, including mass shootings, suicides, murders, accidents, and self-defense shootings.

On Location: July 16, 2021 Grammy-nominated rapper DaBaby was released after being questioned about a shooting in Miami's South Beach on Memorial Day that left two people wounded and a member of the entertainer's entourage under arrest on suspicion of attempted murder, according to police. The shooting capped a violent holiday weekend across Miami-Dade County that included two mass shootings, in which four people were killed and more than 30 injured. The South Beach shooting erupted at about 11:30 p.m. on Monday outside the popular Prime 112 steakhouse on Ocean Drive, the main drag in the oceanside tourist mecca, police said. Witnesses described a barrage of gunfire they said sounded like a war zone. ""It might have been a gun battle because it was like, 'boom, boom, boom, boom boom,' just nonstop. Then it died out, and like five minutes later, again, 'boom, boom, boom, boom,'"" Dimitri James, who lives near the shooting scene, told ABC affiliate station WPLG-TV in Miami. The shooting occurred after a verbal altercation on the street, according to the Miami Police Department. Officers responded to reports of multiple shots fired and found two injured men. Police said one of the shooting victims was in critical condition and paralyzed, while the other was treated for a bullet wound to the leg and discharged. The names of the two wounded men were not released. Several people in the area at the time of the shooting were detained for questioning, including DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, 29, police said. The rapper was released after being questioned, police said. A police report obtained by WPLG said one of the people arrested was Wisdom Awute, 21, a rapper and member of DaBaby's entourage. A second person under arrest was identified by police as Christopher Urena, 29, of Davie, Florida, officials said. Both men are charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated assault with a firearm. Urena faces additional charges of grand theft and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. Immediately following the shooting, Urena allegedly attempted to steal a car that was in the valet area of Prime 112 and tried to flee the scene but was quickly stopped by police. Urena denied attempting to steal the car and said he was just trying to move it from blocking the restaurant's valet area, police said. The shooting came amid a surge in gun violence in Miami between Thursday and Monday. Two people were killed and 21 were injured, three critically, in a mass shooting early Sunday outside a banquet hall in suburban Miami that was rented out for a concert featuring local rappers, police said. No arrests were made in the shooting. Security video released by police showed three masked gunmen, armed with high-powered rifles and handguns, pull up to the El Mula banquet hall in Hialeah in a stolen SUV, open fire on the crowd outside the venue and then flee in the vehicle, which was later found submerged in a canal, police said. On Friday, one person was killed and six were injured in a drive-by shooting in Miami's Wynwood arts district.

""We know that this is a massive crisis that we need to address much more effectively,"" says Weber, the implementation director at the Giffords Law Center. A 2020 Bloomberg analysis looking at nearly 750 mass shootings over a six-year span found about 60% of the shootings were either domestic violence attacks or committed by men with histories of domestic violence.  “A Massive Crisis”: Majority of U.S. Mass Shootings Have Links to Domestic Violence

www.youtube.com   AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. The Gun Violence Archive is reporting there have been at least 242 mass shootings so far this year. That's more than a mass shooting a day. We turn now to look at the link between domestic violence and mass shootings. Last year, Bloomberg published an analysis of nearly 750 mass shootings over the previous six years. It found that about 60% of the shootings were either domestic violence attacks or committed by men with histories of domestic violence. One of the deadliest mass shootings so far this year took place in San Jose, California, last week, when a 57-year-old public transportation employee killed nine of his co-workers at a light rail yard. Like many other mass killers, the gunman, Samuel Cassidy, had a history of domestic violence. One ex-girlfriend filed a restraining order against him in 2009, accusing him of rape and sexual assault. We're joined now by Julia Weber. She is the implementation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. She's also an expert on domestic violence policy, joining us from San Francisco. Julia Weber, thank you so much. Why don't you lay out these connections that are often overlooked. JULIA WEBER: Well, thank you, Amy. And, of course, thank you for covering this issue. And my thoughts, of course, are with those who are most directly affected by what happened in San Jose last week and, unfortunately, the many people who are dealing with gun violence on a regular basis, as well as domestic violence. And I'm sure we have folks tuning in who have experienced domestic violence, who may be living with domestic violence currently. And, you know, this is a massive public health problem, as is gun violence. And, of course, the nexus between firearms violence and domestic violence is a particularly lethal one, as you've noted. It impacts not only the people most directly affected — intimate partners, children, family members — but all of us, because of the connection to mass shootings. So, domestic violence has been going on long before the firearms violence crisis, but the combination is much more likely to result in severe injury and death. We have over a million women alive today in the United States who have been shot or shot at by male partners. We have 600 women a year, at least, who are killed by their intimate partners as a result of firearms violence. That's one about every 14 hours or so. So, you know, we know that this is a massive crisis that we need to address much more effectively. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Julia Weber, in terms of the — what has been the trend in terms of women being shot to death by their partners? And also, has the pandemic, in one way or another, made things better or worse? JULIA WEBER: Well, you know, one of the challenges in this space is that it's very hard to get good documentation. So, on the one hand, we can see, during the pandemic, for example, that there are communities that have seen an uptick in calls to local hotlines and calls for assistance. We know the National Domestic Violence Hotline has reported an increased use of their chat feature, which is a feature that can allow folks to contact the hotline for safety planning and referral resources without having to pick up the phone, which, of course, became that much more complicated when people were required to stay home, sometimes in an unsafe home with someone who had been abusive. But we have a sense that there has been an increase. At the same time, we see that some places have not reported an increase, which could in fact be the result of ongoing subordination, suppression, marginalization, inability to contact hotlines and others for assistance when we were locked down and unable to leave the house, when children weren't in school and teachers weren't in the same position to report child abuse, which is a form of domestic or family violence, as well. So, you'll see varying numbers, but, in general, we have seen increases around domestic violence and use of firearms in domestic violence cases. The national hotline has reported that more callers are reporting that firearms have played a role in the domestic violence they're experiencing, whether it's threats, injury or concerns about potentially lethal outcomes. AMY GOODMAN: And, Julia, if domestic violence were taken seriously, especially women being killed, abused, getting restraining orders, this link to the mass killings after, if this was known — what has to be done when it comes to these men getting guns, that would prevent so many of these mass shootings? JULIA WEBER: Well, you know, we need to have good policy in place, we need to improve existing policy, and then we need to implement policy. So, that's one of the roles I play in my work around implementation, is that, you know, first we have to advocate for and put in place good policy, which includes automatic firearm prohibitions from the get-go — that is, when an emergency civil restraining order might be issued, an ex parte or temporary order, as well as an order after hearing. In California, that's the case, but it's not the case in every state. It's not the case under our federal law, as well. Then we have to ensure that those policies are handed out fairly, consistently, there aren't workarounds to get around firearm prohibitions. We see too many workarounds in these civil restraining order cases. And then we have to ensure that they're actually followed through on. And that means getting the firearms from someone who currently owns firearms and becomes prohibited. It means ensuring that we have universal background checks, so that if someone who is prohibited attempts to purchase firearms or ammunition, that that would show up, and they would in fact be denied. So, you know, there are several different aspects of what we need to do a better job around policy. And then, of course, we need to do a — AMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds. JULIA WEBER: All right. We also need to do a much better job addressing misogyny and domestic violence from the start — that is, recognizing that there's real harm that occurs as a result of gender bias. AMY GOODMAN: Julia Weber, we want to thank you so much for being with us — this clearly needs a much larger discussion — implementation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Giffords Law Center named for Gabby Giffords. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter. Whallon-Wolkind's identity as the unindicted co-conspirator was first reported by Alan Feuer, a reporter for the New York Times, on Twitter on Thursday. A knowledgeable source speaking on condition of anonymity provided the same information to Raw Story.                    No investigative story ever really ends. If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost."" The Washington Post published an excerpt from the book this week, and in the excerpt, Bender discusses a ""group of Trump's most hardcore rallygoers"" known as the Front Row Joes.

481,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2033248,"There's a resurfaced story making waves online about The Office actress Ellie Kemper's link to one of the Veiled Prophet Organization’s debutante balls, which were dubbed Veiled Prophet Balls in the late 1800s. I get why it’s making waves. The organization excluded Black members for more than 100 years and members tended to wear garb similar to that of the Ku Klux Klan, the web magazine Slate reported. But I usually find it a bit random when it comes to which examples of racism and exclusion the general public and mainstream media choose to clutch on to. There’s a reason Black people created our own businesses, sororities, fraternities, colleges, and universities. We, at some point, were excluded from those already in existence, hence Historically Black Colleges and Universities, hence Black Wall Street, hence Memorial Day. Sadly, even when we created our own traditions, white supremacists repeatedly acted to tear down our creations, steal them, and erase our memory. In 1921, they burned and terrorized the wealthiest Black community in the country, dubbed Black Wall Street in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After the end of the Civil War, they worked to erase the memory of an early Memorial Day tribute on May 1, 1865 for Black soldiers of the Civil War in Charleston, South Carolina. ""Whites had largely abandoned the city, but thousands of blacks, mostly former slaves, had remained, and they conducted a series of commemorations to declare their sense of the meaning of the war,"" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Blight wrote in The New York Times in 2011. “The largest of these events, forgotten until I had some extraordinary luck in an archive at Harvard, took place on May 1, 1865.” Blight described devastating conditions Union captives were kept in, leading to at least 257 of them dying of disease before they were ""hastily burned in a mass grave behind the grandstand"" of the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club. ""After the Confederate evacuation of Charleston black workmen went to the site, reburied the Union dead properly, and built a high fence around the cemetery,” Blight wrote. “They whitewashed the fence and built an archway over an entrance on which they inscribed the words, ‘Martyrs of the Race Course.’"" But when the Ladies Memorial Association of Charleston was asked to confirm the legitimacy of the Memorial Day tribute, a representative of the association wrote in correspondence Time magazine obtained: “I regret that I was unable to gather any official information in answer to this.” The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs considers the first Memorial Day observance to be on May 5, 1868 when the Grand Army of the Republic established Decoration Day to decorate the graves of those killed at war. Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared in 1966 that Waterloo, New York, is the “birthplace” of Memorial Day. Tear down, steal, and erase: It was the American way. President Joe Biden said in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre on Tuesday that “for much too long, the history of what took place here was told in silence.” “While darkness can hide much, it erases nothing” he added. Viola Fletcher, a 107-year-old survivor of the Tulsa massacre, testified before Congress that she was awakened in the night with her five siblings and parents there. ""I was told we had to leave and that was it,"" she said. ""I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home. I still see Black men seeing being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I still see Black businesses being burned. “I still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear the screams. I have lived through the massacre everyday. Our country may forget this history, but I cannot."" American History pic.twitter.com/XE0g7qX7KP The massacre in Tulsa is one of 25 featured on a map of massacres of Black people, from the draft riots of 1863 in New York City to the mass shooting in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina. Nine Black people were murdered during bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston on June 17. In the draft riots, the Irish mob and supporters in the fight against abolitionists terrorized New York City for five days and targeted mostly Black and wealthy communities, according to the City University of New York. An estimated 119 people were killed in the riots, and the fear they invoked drove many Black Manhattan residents uptown to an area now considered Harlem, the university reported. Homegrown scholar on reparations, Dr. William Darity speaks to the 100 year anniversary of the Tulsa massacre and destruction of the Black community adding to the continual inequalities stemming from the destruction of “Black Wall Street” in Greenwood. pic.twitter.com/uuLZEMrdtc The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund tweeted on Tuesday that the economic cost of property loss in the Tulsa massacre alone has been estimated at more than $600 million. ""Nearly 100 additional massacres of this type occurred over decades, costing millions more in lost generational wealth for Black Americans,"" the nonprofit said, linking to an interview of Duke University professor William Darity. He told PBS he believes the wealth gap between Black and white Americans ""best captures the cumulative intergenerational effects of all of these atrocities."" ""Another way to think about this is, Black Americans who have ancestors who were enslaved in the United States constitute about 12 percent of the nation's population, but possess less than 2 percent of the nation's wealth,"" Darity said. ""So, if we were going to close that gap, it would require us to make a national expenditure in excess of $11 trillion."" Tom Steyer's reparations proposal needs to be informed by the work of Dr. Darity. Here is Prof. Darity and Kirsten Mullen discussing reparations proposals on PBS.

483,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/colorado-shooting-victims-demand-answers-public-donations-78046765,"Several families and survivors of those killed in March's mass shooting at a Colorado supermarket are demanding the appointment of a special master to help distribute public donations for victims to a centralized account DENVER -- Several families and survivors of those killed in the March mass shooting at a Colorado supermarket have demanded the appointment of a special master to help distribute public donations for victims to a centralized account. They say the nonprofit groups handling the funds are not being transparent about donations provided to victims. Their campaign has reopened a debate that emerged after past mass shootings over how Americans can best help alleviate the anguish of personal and financial losses that survivors endure after their lives have been shattered by senseless violence — and how the administrative costs of fund gathering and administration play a role. The groups giving out donated money to survivors of the 10 people killed March 22 at the King Soopers market — Community Foundation Boulder County and the Colorado Healing Fund — defend their work and dispute that the appointment of a special master is needed. They have raised a collective $5.86 million so far. Boulder resident John Mackenzie, whose wife, Lynn Murray, was among those killed, announced that he and three other victims' families and supporters have created a group called         StandUpBolder to demand that government officials intervene and audit the handling of the donations. They're also asking that Kenneth Feinberg be appointed special master to design and administer the relief effort. Feinberg is a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who oversaw compensation programs after the 9/11 terror attacks, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Pulse nightclub massacre in Florida, the Aurora, Colorado movie theater attack and many other mass shootings. “Millions are being collected because of this tragedy,” Mackenzie said in an interview. “There is no victims’ fund. You don't treat people this way, especially people who are grieving the loss of their loved ones in the most horrific way I can imagine.” His 62-year-old wife was shopping at King Soopers when she was killed, following a long career as a photo editor and photographer for magazines including Cosmopolitan and Vogue. She and Mackenzie had two children. StandUpBolder has claimed that the Colorado Healing Fund, a nonprofit created in 2018 to help the public securely contribute to victims of mass casualty crimes in the state, is keeping 5% of donations for administrative costs. StandUpBolder also said the healing fund is making spending decisions without victims' input and plans to distribute some of the money to other nonprofits in the community. Mackenzie's group wants an audit of the fund, the Community Foundation Boulder County and other nonprofits that have solicited donations. He said he hoped other victims’ families would join the effort. Jordan Finegan, executive director of the Colorado Healing Fund, said Tuesday the group has been very clear and open about charging a 5% administrative fee. “Our focus is just to make sure that the best possible things are happening with these donations,” she said in an interview. About $700,000 in direct and indirect cash payments have been distributed through the group's service providers, Finegan said. Steve Siegel, a founding executive board member for the Colorado Healing Fund, also defended the group's approach — saying the entire community was affected by the supermarket attack, not just the immediate families of those who were killed. “It’s kind of like you throw a big rock in the middle of a pristine lake and it creates concentric circles,” he said. “That’s the way I see this world when you have mass tragedy. It doesn’t mean that you just divide the number by whoever falls into any of those concentric circles. It means you need to be ready for the demands or the needs that are placed upon a community in the aftermath of a major shooting.” Feinberg, who spoke with Mackenzie this week, said that “in my way of thinking the best route is to divide the proceeds on a pro rata basis and that’s it.” The focus is on immediate victims and survivors, he said. “There’s no reason to set up an administrative compensation system,” Feinberg said. “And all of this should be done pro bono, including a public audit afterwards. This much came in, this much came out.” Siegel said it would be unwise to appoint Feinberg, whom he called a “spectacular man,” because the attorney “has an approach to things that is diametrically opposed to the way I see these things.” If someone specifically designates a donation for a victim or purpose, that’s how the money will be spent, Siegel said. The donation would be sent to the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, another nonprofit group that makes the direct payments to victims. The Colorado Healing Fund's bylaws as a nonprofit and a foundation prohibit it from directly sending checks. Tatiana Hernandez, CEO of Community Foundation Boulder County, echoed Siegel's belief that donations should be used as part of a “comprehensive and holistic” approach to healing the broader community after a mass shooting. Her group's board just approved a $500,000 grant to be distributed directly to the families of the Boulder shooting victims. “Donor intent is paramount to us, and I believe we were very clear with our donors that there was a broader lens that we were taking than simply immediate support for victims' families,” she said. Mackenzie said his group has launched an online petition to ask Gov. Jared Polis and Attorney General Phil Weiser an audit of the donations so far and to appoint Feinberg. After the 2012 Aurora mass shooting in which 12 people were killed, then-Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, now a U.S. senator, appointed Feinberg as special master after several families claimed a victims fund was being mismanaged. The 21-year-old man charged in the supermarket attack faces multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. His defense team has suggested he suffers from mental illness, although they have not offered details. “This isn't about justice. Justice is returning my wife to me. That's never going to happen,” Mackenzie said. “But where is the real compassion and humanity in all this? I'm being revictimized.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2021-06-02 15:07:00,Colorado shooting victims demand answers on public donations,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
484,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2021/06/02/us-gun-sales-slowed-down-last-month---but-are-still-much-higher-than-average-heres-why/,"Americans purchased over 1.3 million guns in May, according to industry estimates, a drop from last year’s astronomical sales, which were driven by politics and a pandemic, but still making for one of the busiest springs on record. Anthony Del Rosario examines a shotgun at The Gun Store in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 14, 2008. Some 1.4 million guns were sold last month, the consulting group Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting estimated, using a formula based on FBI background check data. That’s a 22% decrease from April of this year and a nearly 17% drop from May 2020, but sales were still up almost 50% from May 2018 and 2019 and 35% from May 2017. The National Shooting Sports Foundation — an industry trade group — says Americans bought more than 1.3 million guns last month, which they estimate was the second busiest May on record for firearm sales, outpaced only by May 2020. May is usually a slow month for gun sales, especially compared to the busy holiday shopping period and fall hunting season, so it’s not surprising to see a slight drop from April, Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting’s chief economist Jurgen Brauer told Forbes. 9.2 million. That’s how many guns have been sold so far this year, up from 8.7 million at this point in 2020, according to Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting. This year’s sales are higher partly because of a strong January, when over 2.2 million guns were purchased. Americans bought a record 22.8 million guns last year, Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting estimates. Many experts say this surge was driven by fears of Covid-19 disruption, economic peril and political chaos, as well as a renewed interest in shooting as a hobby due to pandemic-imposed boredom. Brauer thinks gun sales have remained strong because last year’s factors are still in play, including Covid-related worries. But Mark Oliva from the National Shooting Sports Foundation argues President Joe Biden has kept the industry busy by pushing for stricter gun control measures. This trend isn’t unusual: Sales also picked up after former President Barack Obama called for tighter gun laws in the wake of the Sandy Hook mass shooting, and sales slumped after the inauguration of former President Donald Trump, who showed little interest in gun control. Oliva says inventory is fairly low at gun stores, which he interprets as a signal the market is not saturated yet and demand for firearms is still high. “Any time you walk into a firearm retailer, you're likely to see empty shelves and empty display cases,” Oliva told Forbes. “There is certainly still a strong demand signal.” I am a breaking news reporter at Forbes.

Wednesday, 02 June 2021 03:20 PM A Los Angeles County firefighter appeared to have a longstanding job-related dispute with the colleague he shot and killed at their small, rural fire station in what became California’s second deadly workplace shooting in less than a week, authorities said Wednesday. The gunman also wounded a fire captain at the station about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Los Angeles on Tuesday before setting his house on fire in a nearby community and apparently killing himself, officials said. Preliminary interviews with other employees at Fire Station 81 indicate the shooter and the firefighter who was killed had “some workplace beef,” said Los Angeles County sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean, who is overseeing the homicide investigation. “It sounds like they didn’t like each other,” Dean told The Associated Press, without elaborating about their problems. He said investigators will comb through the Fire Department's personnel files to see if any official complaints had been made or disciplinary actions had been taken before the bloodshed. It was not immediately clear how long the two had worked together at the station in Agua Dulce, a rural community of about 3,000 people in the desert of northern Los Angeles County. The coroner’s office on Wednesday identified the firefighter who died as Tory Carlon. The 44-year-old fire specialist who drove the firetruck was shot several times in the upper torso, authorities said. He had three daughters and had been with the department for more than 20 years. Hundreds of people honored him at a vigil Tuesday night at a park near the station, remembering him as a devoted father and committed firefighter who mentored younger colleagues. The 54-year-old fire captain who was wounded was still in critical but stable condition. He is expected to survive his injuries, Dean said. Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the captain had previously been a deputy before transferring to the Fire Department. Detectives believe the captain, who wasn't identified, heard the shooting and went to find the source of the gunfire, but it wasn't clear if he tried to intervene or the attacker turned the gun on him, Dean said. It was not immediately clear if the shooter also had a dispute with the wounded man. Property records show that firefighter Jonathan Tatone owned the home that burned in the community of Acton, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the fire station. He bought it last July. Tatone is listed as a county firefighter since at least 2012, according to public payroll and pension records kept by Transparent California. The coroner's office has not officially identified him as the shooter, and an autopsy is pending. Fire Department officials on Wednesday did not release more details about his employment. The gunman was off-duty when he went to the fire station and opened fire, authorities said. He then drove to his house and set it on fire. He was later found dead in an empty pool of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted because nobody else was there and deputies didn't open fire, sheriff's officials said. Investigators seized a handgun at the home they believe is linked to the shooting at the fire station. Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the small station — one of 172 throughout Los Angeles County — has only four firefighters per shift and was considered a second home by employees who typically work 24 hours at a time. “As a fire chief, I never thought that when our firefighters face danger, that they would face danger in one of our community fire stations,” Osby said. Tuesday's shooting occurred less than a week after a man opened fire with three handguns at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, killing nine of his co-workers and then himself as law enforcement closed in. He had rigged his home to burn down before heading to his longtime workplace last Wednesday. Acquaintances said 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy had a short fuse at times and a longtime grudge against his workplace, but the exact motive for the shooting was under investigation. Body camera footage from a Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy who went into a building as shots were being fired was released Tuesday. A new FBI report found that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, aligning with the fact that it's the nation's most populous state. © Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

487,https://www.rawstory.com/desantis-kicks-off-pride-month-by-vetoing-funding-for-lgbt-mental-health/,"As Pride months gets underway, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) vetoed two bills intended to support the LGBT community in Orlando, Orlando Weekly reports. DeSantis cut $150,000 in funding for The LGBT+ Center in Orlando, which would have gone towards mental health and counseling services for survivors of the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub. DeSantis also vetoed funding The Zebra Coalition, which planned to convert a portion of an unused hotel into housing for homeless LGBT+ youth -- a move that came one day after he signed a bill banning trans student athletes from participating in sports alongside the genders they identify with. ""Death Wish"" was a hit movie in 1974, starring Charles Bronson as a violent vigilante. Now it's the primary motivation for the Republican Party. As of this week, in 13 states you have a legal right not merely to have a death wish but to inflict it on others by refusing to get vaccinated against COVID. In 21 more states, bills have been introduced that would limit any requirements that individuals produce evidence that they have been vaccinated. In six of those states, the laws specify that schools, including public primary and secondary schools and public colleges, cannot require coronavirus vaccines, even while the same schools continue to require vaccinations against whooping cough, polio, measles and chicken pox. This article first appeared in Salon.                 According to a report from the Washington Post, any hope that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has of regaining control of the Senate is being imperiled by the GOP's inability to find what one Republican consultant called ""top-notch candidates"" to run in what they see as winnable seats. While the path for Republicans retaking the House appears easier, the split 50-50 Senate appears a tougher nut for Republicans to crack and is being made even more difficult by possible strong candidates staying away because of the undue influence of former president Donald Trump who wants to play kingmaker.           Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) fired back at Megyn Kelly after she waved off the severity and detriment of the deadly Capitol riots. On Monday, July 12, the former Fox News anchor discussed the Capitol riots during a segment of her podcast, ""The Megyn Kelly Show."" According to Kelly, what transpired at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 ""wasn't an insurrection.""

488,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/02/boulder-king-soopers-shooting-donations/,"Trending: DENVER — Several families and survivors of those killed in the March mass shooting at a Colorado supermarket have demanded the appointment of a special master to help distribute public donations for victims to a centralized account. They say the nonprofit groups handling the funds are not being transparent about donations provided to victims. Their campaign has reopened a debate that emerged after past mass shootings over how Americans can best help alleviate the anguish of personal and financial losses that survivors endure after their lives have been shattered by senseless violence — and how the administrative costs of fund gathering and administration play a role. The groups giving out donated money to survivors of the 10 people killed March 22 at the King Soopers market — Community Foundation Boulder County and the Colorado Healing Fund — defend their work and dispute that the appointment of a special master is needed. They have raised a collective $5.86 million so far. Boulder resident John Mackenzie, whose wife, Lynn Murray, was among those killed, announced that he and three other victims’ families and supporters have created a group called StandUpBolder to demand that government officials intervene and audit the handling of the donations. They’re also asking that Kenneth Feinberg be appointed special master to design and administer the relief effort. Feinberg is a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who oversaw compensation programs after the 9/11 terror attacks, the Boston Marathon bombing, the Pulse nightclub massacre in Florida, the Aurora, Colorado movie theater attack and many other mass shootings. “Millions are being collected because of this tragedy,” Mackenzie said in an interview. “There is no victims’ fund. You don’t treat people this way, especially people who are grieving the loss of their loved ones in the most horrific way I can imagine.” His 62-year-old wife was shopping at King Soopers when she was killed, following a long career as a photo editor and photographer for magazines including Cosmopolitan and Vogue. She and Mackenzie had two children. StandUpBolder has claimed that the Colorado Healing Fund, a nonprofit created in 2018 to help the public securely contribute to victims of mass casualty crimes in the state, is keeping 5% of donations for administrative costs. StandUpBolder also said the healing fund is making spending decisions without victims’ input and plans to distribute some of the money to other nonprofits in the community. Mackenzie’s group wants an audit of the fund, the Community Foundation Boulder County and other nonprofits that have solicited donations. He said he hoped other victims’ families would join the effort. Jordan Finegan, executive director of the Colorado Healing Fund, said Tuesday the group has been very clear and open about charging a 5% administrative fee. “Our focus is just to make sure that the best possible things are happening with these donations,” she said in an interview. About $700,000 in direct and indirect cash payments have been distributed through the group’s service providers, Finegan said. Steve Siegel, a founding executive board member for the Colorado Healing Fund, also defended the group’s approach — saying the entire community was affected by the supermarket attack, not just the immediate families of those who were killed. “It’s kind of like you throw a big rock in the middle of a pristine lake and it creates concentric circles,” he said. “That’s the way I see this world when you have mass tragedy. It doesn’t mean that you just divide the number by whoever falls into any of those concentric circles. It means you need to be ready for the demands or the needs that are placed upon a community in the aftermath of a major shooting.” Feinberg, who spoke with Mackenzie this week, said that “in my way of thinking the best route is to divide the proceeds on a pro rata basis and that’s it.” The focus is on immediate victims and survivors, he said. “There’s no reason to set up an administrative compensation system,” Feinberg said. “And all of this should be done pro bono, including a public audit afterwards. This much came in, this much came out.” Siegel said it would be unwise to appoint Feinberg, whom he called a “spectacular man,” because the attorney “has an approach to things that is diametrically opposed to the way I see these things.” If someone specifically designates a donation for a victim or purpose, that’s how the money will be spent, Siegel said. The donation would be sent to the Colorado Organization for Victim Assistance, another nonprofit group that makes the direct payments to victims. The Colorado Healing Fund’s bylaws as a nonprofit and a foundation prohibit it from directly sending checks. Tatiana Hernandez, CEO of Community Foundation Boulder County, echoed Siegel’s belief that donations should be used as part of a “comprehensive and holistic” approach to healing the broader community after a mass shooting. Her group’s board just approved a $500,000 grant to be distributed directly to the families of the Boulder shooting victims. “Donor intent is paramount to us, and I believe we were very clear with our donors that there was a broader lens that we were taking than simply immediate support for victims’ families,” she said.

The boy, Jotsaroop, calls out for his father. “We don’t know how to handle it,” said Singh’s brother, Karman Singh. “We tell him he’s with Babaji.” He’s with God. A week after a disgruntled employee killed nine coworkers, including 36-year-old Taptej Singh, in a blaze of gunfire at the Valley Transportation Authority, the families of the fallen are struggling with how to say goodbye. On Wednesday, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office completed the autopsies of the nine victims and reported all died of “multiple gunshot wounds.” Now, authorities have started to release the bodies to the families so funeral arrangements can be made. Relatives are flying in, and coworkers and first responders are filling living rooms to share condolences. In the midst of it, the families are waiting for answers. “We’re trying our best to not look at the news, just focus on healing together as a family,” Karman Singh said Wednesday. “But there’s that need to know what happened and to understand why it happened.” Why did Sam Cassidy, who worked at the VTA for 20 years before pulling out three semi-automatic handguns from his duffle bag last Wednesday, target some workers and let others live? Had there been complaints about Cassidy to VTA management? Where and when did he get the guns he used in the attack and the dozens of high-capacity magazines, which are illegal in California? What made him snap? A full week into the investigation, neither the VTA, the Santa Clara County sheriff nor the FBI are offering answers. The rail yard and the buildings where the workers were gunned down remain an active crime scene. Yellow police tape still keeps everyone out. The trains are stopped indefinitely. Because Cassidy turned the gun on himself — shooting himself twice — some answers may never be known. “With Mr. Cassidy dead, there’s no opportunity for justice,” said Kasey Halcon, director of victims services for the Santa Clara County district attorney’s office, who also helped families affected by the Gilroy Garlic Festival mass shooting less than two years ago. “When we have a criminal case, the facts are laid out for everyone to see. When the person who killed your loved one goes unpunished, is deceased or never identified, you don’t have the opportunity to have those questions answered — and that complicates healing.” For some families, though, it’s too soon for answers. “The motive is not important to me,” said Karrey Benbow, who is mourning her “loyal, faithful” son, Jose Hernandez III. For now, what she knows about Cassidy is enough: “He’s a coward.” At the Singh home in Union City, three generations of the extended family have been gathering every day. Never are fewer than two dozen loved ones surrounding Singh’s widow, son and 1-year-old daughter. At night, they lay out mats to sleep on the living room floor. The women spend the day cooking lentils and vegetables and baking roti flatbreads for the crowd of more than 100 people from the Sikh community who gather at the family home every evening at 6 p.m. to recite from the holy book. They sit inside and outside — mostly on mats and sheets laid on the ground — in the backyard and front, in the family room and garage. They sing prayers for Singh’s departed soul. Survivors have told the family that both Singh, a light-rail operator, and Paul Megia, a supervisor, were gunned down while shepherding other workers to safety. Singh’s family takes solace in knowing that he died helping others. A selfless act like that, performed with humility, is a highly revered tenet in the Sikh religion known as “sewa,” a way of life to which Sikhs aspire. “In that sense, he was fortunate to sacrifice for others in these moments,” his brother said. But they can’t help feel the anger and frustration that Cassidy — who was widely viewed by family, co-workers and neighbors as antisocial with anger issues — wasn’t stopped. As much as the family has tried to avoid the news, they are aware of reports that Cassidy was detained in 2016 by U.S. customs officials on a return trip from the Philippines carrying books on terrorism and a notebook full of grievances toward his coworkers. “We believe this situation never should have happened in the first place,” said Singh’s brother-in-law, Navdeep Singh. “Some kind of follow-up should have been done. At the least they should have taken the guns away from this guy.” On Thursday, Navdeep Singh, Karman Singh and two other male relatives will perform another sacred function — washing of the body. They won’t know until they get to the Church of the Chimes in Hayward just where the young father was shot or how many times. But they will gently cleanse him, dress him in fresh clothes and tie a turban around his head. His body will be placed in a big hall and, while prayers are sung, the viewing will begin one by one. Singh’s brother, Karman, will try to stay focused on his older brother’s life, the family’s healing, and the grieving widow and toddlers left behind. He still doesn’t know how to tell a 3-year-old child that his father will never come home. Maybe answers about the shooter will help explain, if not to Singh’s little son, then to the rest of the family.Related Articles

(AP Photo/David Swanson) David Swanson  SANTA CLARITA, Calif.  — A Los Angeles County firefighter appeared to have a long-standing job-related dispute with the colleague he shot and killed at their small, rural fire station in what became California’s second deadly workplace shooting in less than a week, authorities said Wednesday. The gunman also wounded a fire captain at the station about 45 miles north of Los Angeles on Tuesday before setting his house on fire in a nearby community and apparently killing himself, officials said. Preliminary interviews with other employees at Fire Station 81 indicate the shooter and the firefighter who was killed had “some workplace beef,” said Los Angeles County sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean, who is overseeing the homicide investigation. “It sounds like they didn’t like each other,” Dean told The Associated Press, without elaborating about their problems. He said investigators will comb through the Fire Department’s personnel files to see if any official complaints had been made or disciplinary actions had been taken before the bloodshed. It was not immediately clear how long the two had worked together at the station in Agua Dulce, a rural community of about 3,000 people in the desert of northern Los Angeles County. The coroner’s office on Wednesday identified the firefighter who died as Tory Carlon. The 44-year-old fire specialist who drove the firetruck was shot several times in the upper torso, authorities said. He had three daughters and had been with the department for more than 20 years. Hundreds of people honored him at a vigil Tuesday night at a park near the station, remembering him as a devoted father and committed firefighter who mentored younger colleagues. The 54-year-old fire captain who was wounded was still in critical but stable condition. He is expected to survive his injuries, Dean said. Detectives believe the captain, who wasn’t identified, heard the shooting and went to find the source of the gunfire, but it wasn’t clear if he tried to intervene or the attacker turned the gun on him, Dean said. It was not immediately clear if the shooter also had a dispute with the wounded man. Property records show that firefighter Jonathan Tatone owned the home that burned in the community of Acton, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the fire station. He bought it last July. Tatone is listed as a county firefighter since at least 2012, according to public payroll and pension records kept by Transparent California. The coroner’s office has not officially identified him as the shooter, and an autopsy is pending. Fire Department officials on Wednesday did not release more details about his employment. The gunman was off-duty when he went to the fire station and opened fire, authorities said. He then drove to his house and set it on fire. He was later found dead in an empty pool of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted because nobody else was there and deputies didn’t open fire, sheriff’s officials said. Investigators seized a handgun at the home they believe is linked to the shooting at the fire station. Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the small station — one of 172 throughout Los Angeles County — has only four firefighters per shift and was considered a second home by employees who typically work 24 hours at a time. “As a fire chief, I never thought that when our firefighters face danger, that they would face danger in one of our community fire stations,” Osby said. Tuesday’s shooting occurred less than a week after a man opened fire with three handguns at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, killing nine of his co-workers and then himself as law enforcement closed in. He had rigged his home to burn down before heading to his longtime workplace last Wednesday. Acquaintances said 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy had a short fuse at times and a longtime grudge against his workplace, but the exact motive for the shooting was under investigation. Body camera footage from a Santa Clara County sheriff’s deputy who went into a building as shots were being fired was released Tuesday. A new FBI report found that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, aligning with the fact that it’s the nation’s most populous state. ___ Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and Robert Jablon in Los Angeles contributed to this story. ‘Housing takes time’: Northampton homeless settlers defy city deadline to move NORTHAMPTON — In November’s election, voters will be asked to choose two Trustees Under the Will of Charles E.

I feel like a homesteading pioneer every time I make my own peanut butter. Most of my conservative friends and colleagues have been down in the dumps this year, feeling as if we’re barreling toward the republic’s final days. Lots of gloom and doom out there. Ever the contrarian, I’ve been coasting along enjoying life, feeling that these are truly heady times we live in. I’m not concussed, I’m not hallucinating, I just tend to look at most things differently than other people. Perspective helps. I have been hanging around the political circus for so long I take a longer view of things. Yeah, almost everything since March of 2020 has been irritating. I’ve had a sneaking suspicion all along, however, that a lot of the nutjobs like me would eventually be vindicated. That’s not an easy thing to hope for when you’re up against a mainstream press that now does nothing but lie for a living, but I knew that this clown car we’ve been watching for 17 months wasn’t built for the long haul. It’s having its first big breakdown by the side of the road and it’s delicious to watch. My colleagues here at PJ Media and I were never big fans of Anthony Fauci. Anyone with a smarm detector could tell that the guy was more full of crap than a constipated rhinoceros. Those of us who didn’t elevate Fauci to Divine Exalted Expert status in our hearts have been constantly derided. Well kids, as our own VodkaPundit wrote yesterday in his Insanity Wrap, we’ve been right all along about Fauci. Just last week, I led the Briefing with a headline that said: “Fauci Is Unhinged, Untrustworthy, and Unqualified.” It appears that I was being uncharacteristically kind. After Mr. Green got things rolling with the story about Fauci being China’s puppet, Megan took a deep dive into the email story that blew up yesterday: Dr. Anthony Fauci is getting roasted all over social media after the Washington Post and BuzzFeed released scores of his emails, obtained through FOIA requests. The ones that aren’t heavily redacted tell quite a story. It should come as no surprise to readers of PJ Media that Dr. Fauci didn’t believe the line of crap he sold us about wearing “the typical mask you buy in the drugstore” to protect us from the virus—at least he didn’t in Feb. 2020. “Masks are really for infected people to protect them from spreading infection to people who are not infected rather than protecting uninfected people from acquiring infection,” Fauci wrote in an email to Sylvia Burwell, presumably President Barack Obama’s former HHS secretary. “The typical mask you buy in the drug store is not really effective in keeping out virus, which is small enough to pass through the material.” It would appear that Anthony Fauci was one of the first people to know that Anthony Fauci was full of it. Of course, no one was allowed to mention that a man who reversed his positions more frequently than a cat licks itself might be wrong about things. As Megan notes, we had our livelihoods threatened for merely questioning His High Holiness the Dalai Fauci and the Church of COVID: PJ Media has written extensively about how Facebook decimated our traffic and hurt our business over false fact-checks for raising questions about the response to the virus. When our sister sites Townhall and RedState reported that some scientists were questioning whether COVID-19 was engineered or leaked from a lab, they got choked by the Big-Tech bullies and told that we were spreading “fake news.” (Sign up for VIP today to help us stay independent from the censors.) You’ll forgive us if we gloat a little while this fraud is being exposed. Two days ago, Fauci’s cult members were rejoicing about the upcoming book he was publishing detailing his pandemic brilliance. After the email story hit yesterday, that book was — for the moment, at least — sent down the memory hole. Fauci will no doubt spin his way through all of this in a way that is pleasing to his fans. As notorious Fauci foil Sen. Rand Paul said yesterday, the media is predictably giving Dr. ChiCom an assist. While being proven right about this charlatan brings a small bit of satisfaction, the damage he did won’t soon be forgotten. The fact that Republicans and Democrats listened to everything he said for so long is a national embarrassment. That Democrats still treat him like a god is all the proof anyone should need that they should never be in charge of anything. As I wrote last week, why Trump kept him around will endure as one of history’s greatest mysteries. I’m sure we haven’t heard the last of Fauci’s unraveling. There’s got to be more stink to uncover. His only guiding principle was building his own brand. He’s a Kardashian but without the integrity. And he needs to go away forever. WAY TO GO, GRADUATE!

Filed under: The budding multi-hyphenate makes it all look easy, with an acclaimed memoir and a bold new Japanese Breakfast album, ‘Jubilee.’ Is Hollywood next? Michelle Zauner doesn’t have all that much to do at the moment. And she absolutely hates it. It’s the middle of March, and life hasn’t begun crawling back yet. Sure, she has the Zoom interviews to promote two big projects that are finally seeing the light of day, the memoir Crying in H Mart and Jubilee, her third album as Japanese Breakfast, out Friday. (The book is as wrenching as the album is life-affirming, which is a neat dyad.) Zauner, 32, also recently directed a panoramic, single-take live performance for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, so at least the creative rust has started to come off. But it’s been too long since she’s been able to lose herself in something big, to let an artistic work subsume her until she comes out a different person on the other end. Instead, she’s been having to sit still. And that doesn’t sit well with her at all. “I feel like for the last six years I’ve always had another project lined up,” she says while Zooming from her Bushwick apartment. “It is hard for me, definitely. I feel like so much of my mental health is rooted in working on a project, and so not knowing exactly what that’s gonna be is a little nerve-racking, but I’m ready to live in that for a little bit.” There’s been a lot of binge-watching over the past year. (The Queen’s Gambit gets a thumbs up; that last season of Westworld gets a thumbs down.) And like many of us, she spent the pandemic trying new dishes. “I tried to bake like everyone else a little bit, and that did not go well,” she says. “I’ve learned how to make a number of Middle Eastern dips for the first time. I got really into the Headbangers Kitchen, which was this Indian guy who is really into metal and Keto Indian dishes.” She takes food very seriously. It’s all but the essence of culture itself to her. Before Crying in H Mart, she wrote a 2018 essay for The New Yorker of the same name, an ode to the popular Korean American supermarket chain often located on the edge of town. She regards it as “a holy place,” and a safe one for her to mourn while searching for the cuttlefish, rice cakes, and other assorted ingredients to re-create the dishes of her childhood in an attempt to hold on to her mother’s memory. It’s now the book’s opening chapter. (It was a pretty hands-off editing process for that essay, by the way. She just had to tweak one word and cut the last sentence. Nailed it on the first take.) But while many of us struggled with our sourdough starter kits, Zauner followed through on her big pandemic projects, finishing a final revision of her book. Crying in H Mart lovingly but not sentimentally tells the story of Zauner’s mother, Chongmi, who died of cancer at the age of 56 when her daughter was 25, and the difficult transition from child to caregiver. Chongmi, a Korean woman who moved to Eugene, Oregon, to be with Zauner’s American dad, was a tough woman who could only give tough love. “A love that saw what was best for you 10 steps ahead, and didn’t care if it hurt like hell in the meantime,” Zauner writes. They were able to bond through food, at least—Korean as well as American fare, like the fries she liked to order from McDonald’s. Zauner looked to Joan Didion’s grief-stricken memoir The Year of Magical Thinking and Richard Ford’s Between Them: Remembering My Parents, as well as Chang-Rae Lee’s Native Speaker, and his food writing in The New Yorker. “I read a lot of memoirs and stole what I thought was working well for other people,” Zauner says. In H Mart she proves equally adept at describing the mouth-watering texture of noodles and deep-fried battered pork “with its rich sauce on the side,” as she is conveying the void of her grief with breathtaking precision, rendering it as a room without doors. “There’s no escape, just a hard surface that I keep ramming into over and over, a reminder of the immutable reality that I will never see her again,” she writes, crafting the sort of sentence that might make one put the book down for a second and say “damn” to no one in particular. Aware of what some might think, Zauner didn’t mention her music career at all in the first draft, and admits that she was a bit nervous that some people would think her book was “about how I came to be Japanese Breakfast,” she says. But she knew the time she spent taking care of her mother, watching helplessly and trying her best to be strong because those were the only available options, was something unique, something that could resonate even if you think Stereogum is an exotic flavor of mint. Zauner’s literary agent, Brettne Bloom of the Book Group, met her after she won an essay-writing award for a Glamour piece about how learning to cook kimchi helped her feel connected to her mother. At the time, Zauner’s focus was on her music, but they stayed in touch, and after finishing the New Yorker piece “with tears in my eyes,” Bloom knew it was the first chapter of a book. “She is a born storyteller, and this instinct influences everything she does—from the way she cooks to the way she approaches her personal style to her songwriting to her prose,” says Bloom, who is glad her client waited just long enough to begin writing. “I think Michelle wrote this book at the perfect time in her life—she had some distance from the trauma of losing her mother and therefore she was able to examine it from all angles. She was able to see how this loss shaped her work and her sense of self, but she was still close enough to the experience that she remembered it with tremendous specificity.” Bloom also has no regard for anyone who might think 32 is too young to write a memoir. “At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if a writer of Michelle’s talent is 22 or 42 or 92. Michelle writes with eloquent precision about experiences that are incredibly universal—the unique love between mother and daughter, the yearning to belong, the anguish of watching a loved one suffer and die, and the healing power of food and memory.”  Crying in H Mart received rave reviews upon its release in April, and debuted at no. 2 on The New York Times’ Best Sellers List, leading to this priceless tweet about the masterpiece that kept her from the top. But still, we all know How the Internet Is, and Zauner did receive some criticism for the New Yorker essay from those who felt that a biracial woman with a Caucasian father and husband wasn’t an authentic enough source to write with authority on Korean food or identity. “I was definitely the most worried about what, specifically, Korean people would think about the book. But ultimately I’m writing from my own personal history,” she says. “I’ve actually felt really relieved and excited, because I’ve talked to a lot of Korean American journalists who’ve felt this story resonated with them really deeply as a Korean person, and so I feel like I am OK.” (Note: This interview took place a week after the mass shooting at three Atlanta-area spas and massage businesses that left eight people dead, six of whom were Asian women. Through her publicist and Twitter account, Zauner made it clear she wasn’t in a space to publicly comment on the horrific, rising wave of violence against the AAPI community, and didn’t want to come off like she was using a tragedy to promote her work. The Asian American Studies Program at Cornell University has a comprehensive list of resources for the AAPI community, if that might be of interest to you.) Eugene, Oregon, was, in retrospect, a serene place to grow up. But at the time, Zauner felt isolated, “an indoor kid put in a very outdoor environment,” and H Mart recounts the many times she wished she could erase all but the white parts of herself. She got into indie rock as a teenager, as teenagers often do in the Pacific Northwest, finding comfort in the alienation anthems of Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie. She began playing guitar at 16 as a solo artist, “just ’cause I don’t even think that being in a band seemed possible to me,” she says. “It’s like internalized patriarchy.” Not seeing anyone who looks like you can be discouraging, and she was getting discouragement from all sides. “Growing up with an immigrant parent, it was something that [my mom] felt like was her job to protect me from how unrealistic that kind of goal was,” she remembers, with a slight grimace. “She forced me into piano lessons when I was 5 years old that I hated, but value now. But yeah, I think it’s really a funny paradox that many Asian parents force their children to learn an instrument at a young age, but God forbid they become genuinely interested in doing it and pursuing it as a career.” Chongmi never got the chance to see Little Big League, the emo-ish group Zauner formed after graduating from Bryn Mawr College with degrees in creative writing and film, and moving to Philadelphia Rock City. “I think she had seen a couple of my shows when I was 16, a teen playing in Eugene,” says Zauner. “Everyone’s parents always say the same thing. ‘What are you saying? I can’t understand the words.’”  Zauner moved back to Eugene in 2013 after her mother’s stomach cancer diagnosis, taking care of Chongmi for the last year of her life and marrying her boyfriend and bandmate Peter Bradley shortly before her mother passed. She began channeling her pain into a series of homemade recordings, which she would later (in between working at a “hipster pizza place”) turn into Psychopomp, the official debut album by Japanese Breakfast, which was eventually released by mega indie label Dead Oceans in 2016. She quickly followed it up with 2017’s Soft Sounds From Another Planet. Channeling and updating the indie rock she grew up with, the albums were born of pain and confusion, but Zauner wrapped her ballads in enough chilly synthesizers and waved-out guitars that you could become lost in them, until a line like “I ran a mile and then another / Spent my nights by hospital beds” (from “Heft”) jostles you out of your reverie. 2017 was the year that, as Pitchfork’s Jillian Mapes wrote, indie rock was starting to finally become not so thoroughly dominated by white men. That fall, Japanese Breakfast headed out on tour with Mannequin Pussy, a ferocious and tuneful Philadelphia indie-punk band fronted by Marisa “Missy” Dabice. They’d had a lot of mutual friends in common, and had been online friends for a while. (It’s extremely worth pointing out that Mannequin Pussy recently released the Perfect EP, and it whips very hard.) Check your inbox for a welcome email. “There weren’t a lot of young women as the front people of rock bands, and so we felt a lot of camaraderie for each other, which is really nice considering you’re supposed to feel competition toward people,” Dabice says while calling from Philadelphia. “But we never really gave in to that. We started realizing that we might not be able to really hang out unless we went on tour together.” Dabice recalls the 2017 outing as “definitely the most comfortable and at home I ever felt on a tour just because of how inclusive it felt,” she says, pointing to the “women performing and people of color performing and just, like, queerness on stage and seeing a crowd that was so diverse every night.” The two became intensely close very quickly, bonding over a shared understanding of the pain of cancer and the terror of living with the uneasy knowledge that your body can betray you and life can be brutally unfair. Dabice is a teenage cancer survivor, and also moved back home for a while in her 20s to be a caregiver for her mother after she had a stroke. “We have a lot of those same fears still,” she says. “Going through something that people don’t usually go through until much later in their life, this wall kind of starts to exist whether or not you want it to be between you and other people. And it takes years to find people who really understand what it felt like to be in that place. People can have sympathy and people can be empathetic, for sure, but it is different when you meet people who understand in a different way.” And when you understand someone in a different way, it makes it easier to see when they’ve changed. Dabice spent the beginning of the pandemic rarely leaving her apartment, fearful because of her health history. But eventually, she and her partner began joining Zauner and her husband for epic, hours-long drunken nights of Settlers of Catan, replete with Renaissance Faire music blasting. (As is often the case with high-achieving individuals, Zauner is quite competitive, apparently.) One those nights, Dabice could tell her friend was in a different place. “We’d spent an hour talking about how everything’s so fucked up, but it was really just finding the joy in being together and having fun and laughing and playing and doing really ugly makeup on her face,” Dabice says. “When I’m with Michelle, I definitely access the joy a lot more too. We’re both kind of like going, ‘We definitely exist.’”  If you feel bad that you didn’t get around to finishing your King Lear during quarantine, do know that Zauner finished Jubilee before everything shut down. Which was kind of her, because finishing off two magnum opuses in a year would have made the rest of us wonder what we’re doing with our lives. (Though she did drop an EP as Bumper, a collaboration with her friend Ryan Galloway of the band Crying, a collection of dance pop so exuberant it makes Carly Rae Jepsen look like a wallflower.) The two projects informed each other, she feels, and closing the book on the worst era of her life has allowed her to start a better one. “I think after writing two records about grief and suffering and trauma, and then a whole book about that experience, it felt like I was ready to write about something else in my life. I felt like flinging myself to the opposite end of the spectrum and challenging myself to write about something new,” she says. “It’s been six years since my mom passed away, and I am someone that is capable of joy and fascinated by it.” The newfound desire to fight for happiness, to allow sadness to be just a part of her, is right there on the album cover, an explosion of color and life compared to the more muted images associated with her earlier. Zauner is eating a persimmon, a popular snack in East Asia, a “very hard, bitter fruit that matures into this very sweet dried fruit.” The album is drenched in yellow, a color of joy and rebirth. Being a fan of geek culture, she knows some will think she’s referencing the X-Men character Jubilee (one of the most high-profile Asian superheroes), and she’s fine with that too. “It was the first time that I also really allowed myself to be front and center in an album cover.” She originally planned to release the album last year, and was all set to film a video for “Be Sweet” that would have involved “kids running around New York City and touching each other’s faces.” She didn’t want to sacrifice her vision for the live shows, “and music videos have become such an important part of the Japanese Breakfast Universe, and not having that was really devastating.” So she decided to wait until she didn’t have to scale down, even if she would occasionally look at the fervor around Fiona Apple’s acclaimed quarantine staple Fetch the Bolt Cutters and think, “Am I being too markety about finding the correct time to release this? Someone like Fiona Apple is just such a true artist that does not give a shit about this kind of thing.” In H Mart she says there was a time in her life when she entertained the idea of being a music journalist, and often thinks of her catalog in terms of narrative. She worried about the sophomore slump for Soft Sounds From Another Planet, and having survived that, she knew it was time to level up. “I found myself looking at other artists that I really admired with tremendous third LPs, like Wilco or Björk, and feeling like, ‘OK, it’s the third album,’” she says, “It’s time to flex every muscle and really assert who you are and what you’ve become as a musician and the skill set that you’ve developed, and open up the world to other musicians that you know and have met.” Jubilee is indeed a big step forward, one concerned with the hard work of cutting out toxic people and forcing yourself into the light, making yourself feel grateful for what’s good in your life. Coproducing alongside longtime confidant Craig Hendrix, she took music theory lessons and pushed herself to cowrite string arrangements for the seasick ballad “Kokomo, IN,” an ode to enjoying a moment even if it won’t last or isn’t perfect. For closer “Posing for Cars,” she steps up to drop, frankly, the sickest solo indie rock has seen since, depending on how deep you go into the emo scene, the War on Drugs’ “Up All Night” or Foxing’s “Lich Prince.” It’s a pull-down-the-sky moment reminiscent of Pink Floyd and Sonic Youth at their most grandiose, one only capable of by an artist who knows they can do whatever they set out to achieve. Originally, she planned to ask her friend Meg Duffy of Hand Habits to handle the solo but decided it had to be her. Noting that “I was really inspired by the Wilco song ‘At Least That’s What You Said.’” “‘Posing for Cars’ starts as this very sweet observation of how two people in a relationship can love each other, and I wanted to have this long, sprawling solo, this kind of sonic narrative, where everything that can’t be said in the lyrics or in that moment out loud can be expressed through the guitar.” Jubilee was introduced to the world with “Be Sweet,” a Janet Jackson–inspired indie-pop banger she wrote with Jack Tatum of Wild Nothing. With its effervescent, dancing-on-molecules mien, it looks to be this era’s answer to Phoenix’s “Lisztomania,” the Song of the Summer for a certain type of music listener and the soundtrack to house parties and new beginnings that will, at least, be better than what we all just lived through. (Right?) Zauner directed the endearingly goofy “Be Sweet” video, which was equally inspired by Spike Jonze’s video for the Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” and The X-Files, which fits into the whole “I want to believe” lyrical motif. (She swapped out FBI agents for cop show tomfoolery, “’Cause, like, fuck the police. We’ll be special agents that are observing aliens.’”) She’s been directing her own videos, working alongside her director of photography Adam Kolodny, since he handed over the reins after they codirected “Everybody Wants to Love You.” She’s grown into one of the most imaginative music directors in the field with a sharp eye for the beguiling power of color contrast. Her latest video, for the rich-guy takedown “Savage Good Boy,” stars Michael Imperioli, the Sopranos star turned popular indie-rock Instagram influencer. But the “Be Sweet” video was just a bit more personal, as she recruited Dabice to be her co-agent, thus cementing the public image of the pair as the indie Tina and Amy, aspirational friendship goals for anyone who’s ever felt attacked by a low Pitchfork score. Dabice was impressed by Zauner and Kolodny’s attention to detail (the lyrics to “Be Sweet” are written out in binary code in one scene), but she’s even more impressed with the relentless generosity of her friend, who pushed her to start directing Mannequin Pussy’s videos, starting with “Drunk II.” “It was definitely something I was interested in, but didn’t think I could do. I had written this big treatment and asked Michelle to direct it. And she was like, ‘Well, what do you want to do?’ And then I just said everything I wanted in the video and all these things, and she was like, ‘You are a director. I know you. You’re like the same as me. You already thought of everything that a director would do. You should just do it,’ and that gave me the confidence to be like, ‘Just because I haven’t done something before doesn’t mean I couldn’t learn it.’ When your friend is Michelle and she believes in you, it’s definitely infectious and you believe in yourself as well.” (Ever a bestie, Zauner also stepped up for Dabice when the buzzy HBO drama Mare of Easttown wanted the show’s high school band Androgynous to cover a few Mannequin Pussy songs in a scene. Since they were on tour, Zauner showed up on set and coached the actors on how to look like they were really in a group.) Zauner is already an impressive multi-hyphenate who’s directed for other artists (including a video for the Phoebe Bridgers–Conor Oberst collaboration Better Oblivion Community Center), hosted a Vice cooking show, and acted in an episode of Search Party at the behest of director Carrie Brownstein, and she’s currently working on the score for the video game Sable. But it’s possible we have yet to see the full scope of her vision just yet. “I’m working on a feature, and I know that she’s working on a feature, too. So we’re kind of planning a getaway to get into that headspace of just writing all day and then like sharing our work,” says Dabice. “I think we’ll be seeing a feature film directed by Michelle Zauner sooner than we might think.” Until then, the hyperproductive Zauner is still planning her next step. “I’m kind of just really looking forward to the world opening back up and hopefully getting to go on tour again and having some life experience to figure out what I want to do next,” she says. But of course, she can’t help but think about what her next book might be. “I don’t know when I could possibly have time for this, but I don’t think I’ll ever feel completely Korean in some ways or connected to my Korean heritage without becoming fluent in the language,” she says. “And I’m sure that once I become fluent in the language, I will still suffer from feelings of not belonging, but I think that I would love to create the space for myself to study Korean for a year and actually live in Seoul for a year. “I think even people who don’t have this mixed identity, there’s also something that’s really interesting about being an older person, someone in your 30s ... ‘Am I too old to learn something?’ I think everyone has that anxiety, and I would like to explore that.” Even though she has found some healing, much of the Michelle Zauner Cultural Experience is still heavily associated with grief. The trauma of the pandemic, and the loved ones many lost—often through the callous neglect of an unfair system—is still fresh, even as the world begins to reopen. And it’s an obvious but sad statement that someone somewhere loses someone dear to them every single day. For them, Zauner also has wisdom to offer. “It’s different for everyone. Be incredibly gentle with yourself, and find something or someone to help keep you grounded,” she says with a weary and knowing smile. “Let yourself really feel it and go through it. Because it’s just gonna take time.” Michael Tedder is a freelance journalist who has written for Esquire, Stereogum, and Playboy.

It was a small silver lining to be found in COVID-19’s dark cloud, a temporary benefit of an unfortunate circumstance. The skies cleared, animal and plant life thrived. I made peace with the fact that these benefits wouldn’t last past the lockdowns’ lifting. But when it came to the mass shooting events that seemed to largely fade from sight, I dreaded what a “return to normal” looked like. Then news came that a gunman killed nine people and himself. The Bay Area’s deadliest mass shooting in history, here in Santa Clara County. I was shocked by the tragedy but not by reports that the perpetrator had a known history of domestic violence. Most mass shooters are domestic abusers. A 2020 analysis by Bloomberg found that almost 60% of mass shooting incidents between 2014 and 2019 involved a perpetrator who was a domestic abuser and that nearly half had a history of abuse. Some of the deadliest mass shootings in our community were committed by domestic abusers, according to The Mercury News’ reporting, and their families account for a significant portion of their victims. In 1986, 28-year-old David Welch was upset over his breakup with his 16-year-old girlfriend, so he killed her and five of her relatives and friends. In 1988, Richard Wade Farley shot and killed seven people, motivated by an obsession with his female colleague who didn’t return his advances. It seems logical to conclude that more should be done to curb domestic abusers in the early stages of violence if we’d like to stop mass shootings. The correlation is too great to be ignored. In my time overseeing a domestic violence court, serial abusers seemed to exhibit in greater numbers the sort of indifference toward life that would lead them to commit more violent acts. So what do we do about it? How can we make it so this tragedy is not in vain? What legislative actions and reforms can be undertaken to prevent this sort of thing from happening? The sad truth is that we can’t expect much at this juncture, because we still fail to understand the problem. Maybe we’ve even actively ignored it. We need to study that link before we start pitching cure-alls; not all domestic abusers will become mass shooters, nor are all mass shooters domestic abusers. Identifying the strong correlation isn’t enough when we don’t know why it matters, how we can use it, or what we can do about it. What we can do is start actually trying to understand. We shouldn’t have to rely on domestic violence coalitions or interest groups to fund studies on this subject. There should be teams publicly dedicated to it year-round. If the studies can’t identify any meaning to the correlation, at least we’ll know. If we understand the problem better, we might have the means to do something about it. Related Articles

Rochelle Keyhan and Camila Zolfaghari discuss common practices used by massage parlors engaged in human trafficking and sex work EXCLUSIVE: The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) placed billboards around Rep. Ron Kind's, D-Wis., district encouraging people to call his office about the massage parlor controversy. On Thursday, the NRCC peppered Kind’s western Wisconsin district with billboards blasting the congressional veteran over the spa controversy he is facing and telling people to call his office about it. The five billboards include a picture of Kind and the silhouette of a stripper with the words ""Wisconsin Dem's property used for seedy massage parlor."" ""Disgusted?"" the billboards read. ""Call Ron Kind."" The billboard also included the phone number to Kind’s district office in La Crosse. WISCONSIN DEM’S PROPERTY USED FOR SEEDY MASSAGE PARLOR THAT TOUTED ‘YOUNG’ MASSEUSE ""Wisconsin voters deserve to know Ron Kind made tens of thousands of dollars from a massage parlor that advertised on human trafficking websites,"" NRCC spokesman Mike Berg said in a press release exclusively obtained by Fox News. ""Kind needs to come clean on what he knew and when about his tenant’s ties to illicit activity."" Fox News reported last month that Asian Sunny Massage, a massage parlor renting a business-facing property Kind owns in La Crosse, Wis., advertised its business on various illicit websites that are known as avenues for illicit sex, such as RubMaps. Kind has made thousands of dollars in rent from the parlor, which also advertised its ""young"" masseuses while including suggestive photos of young women on the business’s Facebook page. After the story dropped, the Wisconsin Democrat accused his Republican challenger, Derrick Van Orden, of a ""baseless smear rooted in racism and insinuations"" while invoking the tragic Atlanta spa shooting to defend his business deal with the spa. REP. RON KIND INVOKES ATLANTA MASS SHOOTING IN DEFENDING BUSINESS DEAL WITH MASSAGE SPA ""As a former special prosecutor, I take any allegation of wrongdoing seriously. But that’s not what this is. This is a baseless smear rooted in racism and insinuations. Tawni and I have never received any complaint from the community or police about this small business,"" Kind said in a statement released to the La Crosse Tribune. Tawni Kind is the congressman's wife. Chunyan Yang, the mother of the Asian Sunny Massage’s current registered agent, Jie Yang, was the previous registered agent for the spa while the business was known as Impression Spa. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Fox News has no information that Asian Sunny Massage or Impression Spa have violated any laws or regulations, public records show that Chunyan ran a massage parlor in Plymouth, Minn., where a masseuse was arrested for prostitution in 2017 — one year prior to opening the parlor in the space the company rents from Kind.

503,http://rssfeeds.jsonline.com/~/653884916/0/milwaukee/news~Christopher-Stokes-enters-guilty-plea-in-fatal-shooting-of-family-of/,"Christopher Stokes on Wednesday pleaded guilty to shooting and killing five members of his family in a home on Milwaukee’s north side in April 2020. Stokes, 44, pleaded guilty to all five counts of first-degree intentional homicide and another charge of possessing a firearm by a felon after his case was stalled for months to determine if he qualified for what’s called an NGI plea, not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. His attorney, Nathan Opland-Dobs, declined to comment More: One year later, victims of north side mass shooting remembered as suspect's court case gets reinstated Stokes' sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 27. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Michelle Havas is presiding over the case. According to prosecutors, Stokes called 911 on the morning of April 27, 2020, to report he had “just massacred my whole family” in a home along the 2800 block of North 12th Street, in the North Division neighborhood. Investigators believe Stokes shot and killed Teresa Thomas, 41, her two children, Tiera Agee, 16, and Demetrius Thomas, 15, and two other teens related to Christopher Stokes who had been staying with the family — Marcus Stokes, 19, and Lakeitha Stokes, 17. Stokes was found sitting outside the home with the lone survivor of the shooting, a 3-year-old grandchild of Teresa Thomas, according to documents from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office. Stokes’ case stalled for three months last year after the court determined he lacked “substantial capacity to understand court proceedings,” online court records said. After his case was reinstated, two doctors evaluated him for an NGI plea, which contends that at the time a defendant commits a crime, a mental disease or defect prevented him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his action or from conforming his conduct to the law. In April, the brother of Teresa Thomas, Johnny Hall, told the Journal Sentinel it had been difficult watching Stokes’ case drag on without a trial, saying, “We need a sentencing and we need it now. Justice must be served.” “Being around them, it meant a lot to me,” Hall said, referencing Teresa Thomas and her family. “They mean the world to me.” Contact Elliot Hughes at elliot.hughes@jrn.com or 414-704-8958.

""If I were a Jew I would be concerned about my insatiable appetite for war and killing“ “I would be afraid of my increasing insensitivity to the suffering [of] others."" – Kamau Bobb, head of diversity at @Google 🤯 How is the obscene, antisemitic bigot still employed there? pic.twitter.com/IzXQkAzmv9 — StopAntisemitism.org (@StopAntisemites) June 2, 2021  In an overly kiss-assy statement, Google said it “condemned the past writings by a member of our diversity team that are causing deep offense and pain to members of our Jewish community and our LGBTQ+ community.” I’m not sure why they mentioned, the “LGBTQ+ community” other than June is Pride Month. Google issued their apology on June 2, International Sex Workers Day, but didn’t include prostitutes in their mea culpa. “These writings are unquestionably hurtful,” the statement went on. “The author acknowledges this and has apologized. He will no longer be part of our diversity team going forward and will focus on his STEM work.” STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, a department that is probably full of Jews. ISIS wannabe Elvin Hunter Bgorn Williams was arrested last week at Seattle-Tacoma airport trying to fly to Egypt and join ISIS. Hunter told undercover FBI agents he was eager to behead people and even thought about driving a truck through Seattle’s Pride parade. Members of a local mosque gave Hunter a laptop and a cell phone, supposedly to help him find a job and “de-radicalize.” Shockingly, he used the computer to watch ISIS beheadings. He told the undercover agents he specifically wanted to be a suicide bomber or be in charge of beheadings. Hunter’s dreams are likely to be delayed by a 20-year stint in federal prison. Texas crazyman Coleman Thomas Blevins was arrested last week before he could pull off a planned mass shooting at a Walmart. The press was quick to point out Blevins is a neo- Nazi but somehow forgot to mention his devotion to Islam, Francoism, and a bunch of other isms. The Kerr County Sherriff’s picture of Blevins’ radical stash is a cornucopia of ideologies proving that, if anything, Blevins is a complete wackadoo. Francoism? He’s CRAZY! Swedish police chief Erik Nord said what other Swedes think but will never say: shootings and bombings are linked to migration. “It is no longer a secret today that much of the problem of gang and network crime with the shootings and explosions have been linked to migration to Sweden in recent decades,” Chief Nord wrote in an opinion article for the newspaper Goteborgs Posten. “When, like me, you have the opportunity to follow matters at the individual level, you see that virtually everyone who shoots or is shot in gang conflicts originates from the Balkans, the Middle East, North or East Africa,” he said. Every gang leader arrested thus far is a migrant or is descended from migrants. The emboldened gangs have gone so far as to put up their own roadblocks and openly threaten police. Sweden, once one of the safest counties in Europe now has the most gun violence, and has held that Detroit-like title since 2018. Some refer to Sweden’s problem of Muslim violence as a “ticking time bomb.” As I reported in Allah in The Family Vol. 1, two parents were arrested for “honor-killing” their gay son, filmmaker Babak Khorramdin, and disposing of him in suitcases. The couple, Iran and Akbar Khorramdin, have since admitted to icing their daughter and son-in-law as well. Apparently killing your kids is ok in Iran. The only way the couple will get a life sentence is for killing their son-in-law. Police are looking into whether or not more members of the Khorramdin clan have disappeared in Samsonite luggage.

506,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/03/colorado-redistricting-police-reform-the-spot/,"Trending: Redistricting commissioners in Colorado expect to release their first proposed map in less than three weeks. The congressional map will be unveiled June 23 and the legislative map June 28, both coming after the Colorado Supreme Court gave the green light to use incomplete data. These maps will be drawn by nonpartisan staff and will almost certainly change after commissioners take a look, hold dozens of public meetings across the state and receive final census data in August. Still, it’ll be the public’s first glance at how the commissions are leaning. Where will the new 8th Congressional District be? Which congressional district will Pueblo fall into? Will U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert’s district become more or less Republican? And what happens to competitive legislative districts in Jefferson County that Democrats hold and Republicans want? “If other states’ experiences are a guide, we should expect considerable public interest in Colorado’s new redistricting process overall and the release of the preliminary plan is one of the first milestones,” said Curtis Hubbard, a Democratic consultant who is registered to lobby the commissions. “But it’s important to remember that we’re still in the early miles of a redistricting marathon.” Alan Philp, a Republican consultant who worked on Colorado’s redistricting in 2001 and 2011, said the preliminary maps “should be taken seriously because the nonpartisan staff is drawing the maps and they take their job very seriously” but noted these will be just the first of several iterations. “The bottom line is, no one should get too excited or too depressed about the preliminary maps. They are the start of a map drawing process that will take several months,” Philp said. To support the important journalism we do, you can become a Denver Post subscriber here.

Read more from The Associated Press here. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has signed 205 bills as of June 1, and the legislature was still considering 215 bills at that time, according to a legislative analysis. Lawmakers have until 11:59 p.m. June 12 to finish the session, though there has been some discussion they’ll end earlier. You can check the status of major bills with The Denver Post’s bill tracker. Polis signed several bills since our last The Spot newsletter, including: The nonpartisan Colorado Capitol Watch has compiled a list of all signed bills here. Dark-of-night policymaking Late nights are common at the end of a legislative session — even if people in the Capitol grumble about it. But when committee hearings run into the early mornings, it discourages citizens from weighing in. As one Senate committee hearing neared midnight last week, for example, there were still four major bills left on the agenda. Sure enough, when the chair called for the signed-up witnesses on those bills, many had dropped off. The result: Major policies are amended and voted on to the floors in the dark of night. Of course, committee members almost always have their minds made up before they vote on something. It’s rare that a person’s testimony meaningfully changes a bill. But in a democracy, people should still have their say if they want to. “I don’t know what else to do to fix that,” said Rep. Susan Lontine, a Denver Democrat who chairs the House Health & Insurance Committee. “It’s tough to balance citizen participation with trying to get our work done with the limited time left.” This year, people could testify remotely instead of going to the Capitol and waiting around for hours to speak. It’s a COVID change that interviews with several Capitol leaders suggest is likely to stick. More Colorado political news A community task force handed Denver’s public safety officials a laundry list of ways to improve. But there won’t be immediate action — there’ll be more study, and it’ll take a while. While Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration considers the 112 recommendations from the Task Force to Reimagine Policing and Public Safety, so too will the city council’s newly created Public Safety Working Group. The council has less say in day-to-day operations but more control over the city’s budget. It could shift funding away from police and toward other programs and nonprofit service providers, Council President Stacie Gilmore said. But there’s always the threat of a mayoral veto (which Hancock has only used once in his three terms). “If there’s a stalemate, that’s going to be really difficult,” Councilwoman Jamie Torres said. “The role we’ve got to play is to avoid getting to that extreme point.” Torres said she’s specifically interested in strengthening the role of the city’s independent monitor — which provides citizen oversight for Denver’s law enforcement agencies. The council could also refer to voters other recommendations, like decriminalizing drug use, public intoxication or traffic offenses, Gilmore noted. Torres said she empathizes with calls for immediate action, but noted that the council must study and understand the recommendations before taking any concrete action.

All known evidence rules out any connection to the VTA massacre. A law-enforcement source told this news organization that the shooting appears to be a gang-related retaliatory attack for another deadly shooting in East San Jose in March, and that the man killed Thursday was not the target, but was walking with that person. At least one man was seen by witnesses running from the intersection of West Hedding and North San Pedro streets moments after the gunfire, which left a man lying dead in a street surrounded by the county’s Hall of Justice, Main Jail, and county government center. Friday, San Jose police announced that 43-year-old Eric Zarate and 34-year-old Michael Herrera, both San Jose residents, were arrested soon after. The shooting victim, identified by the coroner’s office as 20-year-old Malik Johnson, died at the scene. His death is the 27th homicide in the city this year, the 18th investigated by San Jose police. Law enforcement officers swarmed the area after the shooting broke out around 1:50 p.m. — San Jose police and the sheriff’s office are headquartered within line of sight. San Jose police said early on there was no indication that the shooting was connected to the mass shooting May 26 at the VTA railyard off Younger Avenue, which claimed the lives of nine VTA employees and ended with the gunman, also a VTA worker, fatally shooting himself. Around the same time Thursday afternoon, the sheriff’s office stated in a tweet that “there is no threat to public safety.” Zarate is the father of 25-year-old Eric Zarate Jr., who was shot and killed March 6 on Alvin Avenue and Center Ridge Drive, just steps away from O.B. Whaley Elementary School. On March 25, two teens and a man were wounded in a shootout at Brigadoon Park near Silver Creek High School in what sources told this news organization was an attempted retaliation for the Zarate shooting. Witnesses to Thursday’s shooting reported seeing a Mercedes-Benz with bullet holes on the driver’s side. Pooran Haq said she was driving through the intersection to pick someone up from the courthouse when she heard at least three shots behind her. “I thought maybe there was fireworks,” Haq said. “I came out of my car and I looked, and I saw the guy. He raised his hands up.” Haq then said she saw the victim “flat on the ground.” Moments later, she said she saw another male running away. “He came from here and he ran this way,” Haq said, gesturing east toward North First Street. State Sen. Dave Cortese, who just finished a stint as a county supervisor, issued a statement in response to Thursday’s shooting. “With our community still reeling from last week’s horrific shooting, we are experiencing shock and profound heartbreak once again,” Cortese said. “Another violent shooting has occurred today right in our County Civic Center a block away from last week’s tragedy. Thank you once again to our first responders that rushed to the scene.” “This is only another indication that meaningful steps need to be made to strengthen and expand California’s laws to prevent this kind of violence and I am committed to taking any action needed to safeguard our community. This can’t continue to happen.” Anyone with information about Thursday’s shooting can contact SJPD homicide Detective Sgt.

As it turns out, the site got it right this time around, as all of those titles fit Burnham well throughout his latest Netflix special Inside, his first special in five years. Some standout, ridiculously catchy, and laugh-out-loud funny songs and videos from Inside include the delightfully absurd “Jeffrey Bezos” and bitingly accurate “White Woman’s Instagram.” But while the entire 1 hour and 27 minute special — which was completely written, shot, and edited solely by Burnham — showcases the depth of his brilliance and talent accumulated over the past 15 years of his career, it is Burnham’s number, “Funny Feeling,” that ultimately steals the show and best encapsulates his many job titles and monikers all in the span of less than five minutes. Compared to the poppier and slightly busier “Jeffrey Bezos” and “White Woman’s Instagram,” “Funny Feeling” is much more contained and understated, which is probably what helps to make it so incredibly impactful. There are no synthy beats, flashing lights, or props to distract the viewer. It’s just Burnham and his acoustic guitar, backlit by a wooded background projected on his wall, emitting both a vibe and sound that’s contemplative, melancholy, and folky. Arriving about three-quarters of the way into Inside, “Funny Feeling” enters the fray on the heels of songs and short bursts of stand-up revolving around the internet, but immediately sets itself apart by evoking the sort of titular funny feeling that’s repeated in each refrain. The song feels almost like a gut punch, as something about the words, so seemingly discordant with each other but all so familiar, may out of nowhere make you feel like you’re ready to cry. “Funny Feeling” makes it clear that “poet” absolutely deserves to be a role associated with Burnham’s name and work, full of evocative and hyper-specific lyricism that immediately resonates and helps this song to emerge as one of the top works of not just the special, but of Burnham’s entire career. Throughout Inside, we see that Burnham is struggling with his mental health, and yet is shutting himself in this narrow room for months upon months to feed us insatiable consumers the “content” that we keep demanding. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an isolating and lonely time for most of us, and even worse for those who already suffered from depression and anxiety. Burnham’s special demonstrates his complete understanding of this broad spectrum of feeling, from wacky to manic to furious to utterly miserable. In some parts of the special, it is hard not to look at Burnham and feel like this is a man who is suffering, who is breaking his back to make something to satisfy us, his desperate audience, but also to satisfy himself and his (perhaps unwanted and almost involuntary) desire for attention and praise.  “Funny Feeling” perfectly ties together all of these fragments of emotions, musical numbers, breakdowns, and bits. This song is so perfect for this special, in particular, because Inside — which reads as part comedy special, part Black Mirror-like work of dystopian horror and social commentary — will leave you with a funny feeling. You may laugh, you may be impressed, you may love and dance to some of the catchier music, you may feel unsettled or upset, or maybe you’ll feel all of the above. Your own mileage may vary, but Burnham inarguably succeeds at his ultimate mission: it’s impossible to walk away from Inside without feeling something.

510,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/briefing/vaccines-china-cicadas.html,"Advertisement Supported by Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. By Will Dudding and Jade-Snow Joachim (Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Besieged with requests to share coronavirus vaccines, the Biden administration said it would distribute 25 million doses across a “wide range of countries.” The vaccines — which will be sent to Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, as well as the Palestinian territories, war-ravaged Gaza and the West Bank — are the first installment of a total of 80 million doses President Biden has pledged to send overseas. The Biden administration recently backed waiving intellectual property protections for coronavirus vaccines, but activists say donations and waivers are not enough. They have called for pharmaceutical companies to transfer their intellectual property to vaccine makers overseas, so that other countries can build their own vaccine manufacturing operations. (Above, a mobile vaccination center in Kolkata.) In other developments: In Italy, only three of 20 regions accept the temporary ID numbers given to hundreds of thousands of migrants to book vaccine appointments. As U.S. colleges announce Covid vaccine mandates, some international students are unable to get the required shots. The U.S. is roughly on track to meet the president’s goal of getting at least one Covid-19 shot into the arms of 70 percent of adults by July 4, but some states are lagging. 2. President Biden issued an executive order barring Americans from investing in Chinese firms that are linked to the country’s military, or selling surveillance technology that is being used to repress dissent or religious minorities. The order expands another edict issued in November by Donald Trump, and comes at a moment when China is ramping up its ability to spy on its population using facial-recognition cameras and software, phone-scanners and a range of other tools. Biden also told Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the lead Republican negotiator on an infrastructure package, that her party must embrace $1 trillion in new spending as part of any bipartisan deal. He also suggested a willingness to narrow his corporate tax proposals to win Republican support. Separately, the Justice Department is investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy over potential campaign fund-raising violations when he was in the private sector. 3. Post-pandemic wage growth is holding up. Unlike low-wage workers in past recessions, many of those who held on to their jobs saw their wages rise even during the worst months of the pandemic. Above, a Target in New Jersey. The Biden administration is hoping that broader wage gains will shift power toward workers and away from employers. And Federal Reserve officials have indicated that they would like to see employment and pay keep rising. The stage is set for an economic experiment that will test whether the economy can restart without igniting rampant inflation. But nothing is certain. Ahead of the jobs report tomorrow, a variety of indicators that normally move more or less together are telling vastly different stories about the state of the economy. 4. Benjamin Netanyahu isn’t going down without a struggle. The longtime Israeli prime minister, who is on the verge of being ousted by an unlikely coalition of opposition parties, called on lawmakers to oppose “this dangerous left-wing government.” On Thursday, he began an all-out campaign against his opponents, listing concessions that he claimed the coalition leaders Naftali Bennett, the head of a hard-right political party, and Yair Lapid, a centrist politician, had made to secure an alliance with Raam, an Arab Islamist party. Lawmakers from Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, can also use parliamentary procedure to delay a crucial confidence vote until June 14. In that time, his party has promised to pile pressure on right-wing members of the alliance to jump ship, arguing they sold out by aligning themselves with leftist and Arab lawmakers. 5. When does a gunman’s motive matter? One of the biggest questions after every mass shooting is what drove the gunman to violence. But some criminal profilers have begun to discuss the limitations of fixating on motive, with one expert saying “there is no such thing.” One big exception: With hate crimes, motive is of utmost importance. When six women of Asian descent were killed in Atlanta, the suspect denied any racial motive. The trial could serve as a test of what kind of evidence might persuade jurors that a hate crime was committed, and the credibility of the defendant’s own explanations of his actions. Above, a protest in Georgia. Separately, a United Nations report suggested that an A.I. drone used in Libya’s civil war may have selected a human target autonomously — a possible first that forebodes a scary new future for unmanned warfare. 6. A U.N. agency tasked with reducing carbon emissions in the shipping industry is doing the opposite. The International Maritime Organization, which has close ties to the shipping industry that it oversees, has repeatedly delayed and watered down climate regulations. Shipping produces as much carbon dioxide as all of America’s coal plants combined. Above, a container ship in Hong Kong. Just last week, delegates met in secret to debate what should constitute a passing grade under a new rating system. Under pressure from China, Brazil and others, they set the bar so low that emissions can continue to rise at roughly the same pace as if there had been no regulations at all. 7. Michelle Wie West was ready to hang up her clubs. Pregnant and struggling with chronic wrist injuries, the champion golfer was considering retirement. But vulgar comments Rudolph Giuliani made about her putting stance crystallized her determination to make a comeback to address inequities and ignorance in women’s sports, and in the broader culture. “What this person should have remembered from that day was the fact that I shot 64 and beat every male golfer in the field, leading our team to victory,” she said. In the past year, Wie West has revealed a different side of herself as a leader in the drive for equity and change. Giuliani’s comments triggered her election to the L.P.G.A. board of directors and a determination to speak out. 8. There are only about 360 right whales alive today. And they’re getting smaller. Scientists have found that the animals have declined in length by roughly 7 percent since 1981, which translates to a size reduction of about three feet. The culprit is most likely fishing gear that entangled whales can carry around for years. “What we think is going on here is that dragging these big trailing heaps of gear is creating all this extra drag, which takes energy to pull around, and that’s energy that they would probably otherwise be devoting to growth,” one researcher said. And by looking at the fossil record, researchers believe they’ve discovered a mass shark extinction that occurred 19 million years ago. 9. This might be the summer that Anthony Ramos breaks out. Raised by a single mother in Brooklyn, Ramos worked for years to kick down doors, eventually landing in the original Broadway cast of “Hamilton.” Now, as the star of “In the Heights,” he is hopeful that the film will supply some of the uplift that he feels has been missing from movies released during the coronavirus pandemic. “We don’t have enough movies right now that feel like a celebration of life,” he said. “We need movies that are telling real and honest stories in a raw way that are hard for people to watch. But also, like, we need to feel happy. There’s also joy. That’s like a thing that exists.” We also spoke to Stephen King about the new Apple TV adaptation of one his favorite novels, “Lisey’s Story.” 10. And finally, maybe don’t eat that cicada. In celebration of the emergence of Brood X, we recently alerted our readers to the crunchy-turned-creamy texture of cicadas, reminiscent of soft-shell crabs, but health officials are warning that the similarity to crustaceans also makes the cicada an allergy risk. Cicadas — which do not bite or sting — are gluten-free, high in protein and low in fat and carbohydrates. As insects, however, they also belong to the arthropod family, and people with existing allergies to crustaceans may develop a reaction, according to a new report. But if that doesn’t apply, bon appétit and have a crunchy Thursday. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern. Want to catch up on past briefings? You can browse them here. What did you like?

All three — Jeffrey Norman, James MacGillis and David Salazar — have a history with the Milwaukee Police Department. Wauwatosa's Police and Fire Commission officially named the finalists Thursday. The new chief will lead a department of 100 sworn officers that in the past 18 months experienced a high profile fatal shooting by a police officer, a mass shooting, civil unrest and citywide curfews. Announcement of the finalists comes one day after sources confirmed that Norman, the acting Milwaukee police chief, was a candidate for the job following the June 1 retirement of former Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Webber. Wauwatosa's interim chief Luke Vetter is temporarily leading the department. The police and fire commission will soon hold a public forum with Norman, MacGillis and Salazar.

512,https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/03/hamas-west-bank-terror-cartoon-israel-palestinian/,"(Photo: Screenshot/Hamas West Bank via Telegram) The West Bank wing of Palestinian terror group Hamas released an animated cartoon video on Telegram Thursday showing two Palestinian youths laughing and plotting a terror attack against Israeli forces. The incitement video is one of several that target Palestinian children. Hamas is a Sunni Islamist and Palestinian nationalist terror group that rules Gaza and has a noteworthy presence in the West Bank. Hamas has been growing in popularity in the West Bank, where its rival Fatah dominates. Its armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, recently fought along with other Palestinian terrorist groups in the two-week war with Israel, which began on May 10. Even in times of relative peace, the group is generally known for carrying out terror attacks and inciting violence against Israelis. The video released Thursday is set at night in what appears to be one of the hilly areas of the West Bank. Two animated boys — a short, chubby one wearing a red shirt and blue jeans, and a thin, tall one wearing a light blue top and blue jeans — stage menace and attacks against Israelis, and then laugh about it. (RELATED: ‘The Hamas Caucus’: Republicans Launch Explosive Term For Ocasio-Cortez ‘Squad’) WATCH:  In one scene, the boys get Molotov cocktails ready for an attack and set up wooden planks studded with nails on the road to puncture the tires of incoming Israeli vehicles. After a brief interlude, the short film shows the boy in blue looking ahead with binoculars as an Israeli military jeep arrives along with a pick-up truck carrying electricians. The wooden planks with nails attached puncture their tires, forcing them to stop. As soon as the soldiers within the jeep get out to check what happened, the chubby youth, shouts “Allah is the greatest.” The boys collectively hurl Molotov cocktails towards the jeep, setting it aflame. Finally, all the soldiers get out as a cloud covers the moon. The screen then blacks out as the words “the resistance is will and innovation” appears on-screen. Picture released by Hamas showing its militants on a vehicle in a parade in Gaza following the end of a two-week war with Israel in May (Photo: Hamas/Press Release via Telegram) Hamas has held terrorist training summer camps for children in the past, as reported by Times of Israel, where young Palestinians were taught how to carry out kidnappings of Israeli soldiers, use firearms, and infiltrate Israel through underground tunnels the terror group digs. According to the Times of Israel, such camps occur every year and aim to prepare the next generation of Palestinian youth for conflict with Israel. Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar holds the child of an Al-Qassam Brigades fighter, killed in the recent fighting with Israel during a rally in Gaza City on May 24, 2021. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images) Besides the summer camps, the group features children and teens dressed in military gear and carrying toy weapons as part of its propaganda. The group also incites minors and promotes the admiration of militants through means accessible to them, notably cartoons and T.V. shows. Such use of cartoons by the group goes as far back as the Bush era. Videos below from organizations such as the Palestinian Media Watch and Middle East Media Research Institute —and verified by Daily Caller for the translation’s accuracy — show incitement catered for children in Hamas’ affiliate networks and other media organizations in the Arab world. WATCH:  While Palestinian protestors and Israeli security forces clashed across the West Bank and Jerusalem during the riots over Sheikh Jarrah, Hamas shared a cartoon encouraging young Palestinians to commit violence against Jews on Telegram. WATCH:  The incitement video shows a young Palestinian boy scouting a mall for a terror attack. The boy snaps a picture of the security in order to plan a similar disguise. After purchasing similar clothing, he heads to his house on the Palestinian side of Israel’s protection barrier erected in the West Bank. Inside his house, a painting of the Al Aqsa Mosque is prominently displayed. Then, he kisses the Quran and heads out for the terror mission. The disguised Palestinian youth grabs the security officer’s firearm and shoots him in the head. The youth then carries out a mass shooting inside the mall. The video ends with the words “the non-stop resistance continues.” One of the earliest well-known uses of cartoons for terrorist propaganda by Hamas was the show “Ruwād al-Ghad,” or “Pioneers of Tomorrow,” which was broadcasted from April 13, 2007, to October 16, 2009, on Hamas-affiliate Al Aqsa TV. WATCH:  The show, on-air during the twilight years of the Bush administration and the first year of the Obama administration, was known for its Mickey Mouse character, Farfour, who preaches Islamic domination, anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism, and “resistance”— a euphemism for terrorist acts. “There is nothing comic about inciting young generations of Palestinians to hate Israelis,” an Israeli official told The Associated Press while the show was on-air, according to a 2007 Der Spiegel report. Shortly after the Der Spiegel covered the story, then Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti announced that al-Aqsa TV pulled the show “Ruwād al-Ghad” for “review” in compliance with a government order, adding that using cartoons to incite Palestinian children to fight Israel and strive for global Islamic domination was a “mistaken approach,” Der Spiegel reported.

Shankquia Lechelle Peterson, 32, died Thursday after being shot in the hail of bullets fired by three gunmen into a crowd outside El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, the Miami Herald reported. Twenty other people were wounded in the gunfire. Police are still searching for the suspects. On Monday, authorities released surveillance footage showing three shooters hop out of a white SUV, carrying rifles and a handgun before opening fire. Miami-Dade Police Department Director Alfredo “Freddy” Ramirez III said the gunmen appeared to fire randomly into the crowd — but they had targeted the venue. “These are cold-blooded murderers that shot indiscriminately into a crowd and we will seek justice.

News By Jorge Fitz-Gibbon Submit June 3, 2021 | 11:28pm				| Updated June 3, 2021 | 11:28pm Four suspected gang members were arrested Thursday in connection with a mass shooting at an illegal South Carolina party last month that left a 14-year-old girl dead and more than a dozen others wounded. North Charleston police and US Marshals rounded up the suspects Thursday and charged them with manslaughter and gun possession in the May 22 attack that killed Ronjanae Smith in the city’s north end, WCSC-TV reported. The gathering, which authorities described as an “unauthorized party,” turned deadly when a dispute between rival gangs erupted in violence, police said. “They were so worried about themselves,” North Charleston Deputy Police Chief Ken Hagge said at a briefing Thursday. “They don’t know how to conduct themselves out in public, that’s fine,” Hagge said. “They need to stay home, but we’re going to keep them home now.” Cops said members of the two rival gangs saw each other at the event and opened fire, killing the 14-year-old girl in the crossfire and wounding 14 others. All four alleged gangbangers — Malachi Wigfall, 18; Tye Robinson, 18; Tyquan Denard Cooper, 21; and Manqual Laval Horlbeck — were taken into custody over the course of the day on Thursday, police said. Hagge said police interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed cellphone footage from the scene — and said more arrests are expected. “I’m not going to say how many, but there’s going to be more held accountable for this.” He said nine of the wounded victims were young women. “Manslaughter is murder, folks,” the deputy chief told reporters. “We can only use the tools we have in our toolbox, and we can only charge what we can prove. Manslaughter is where we feel comfortable coming forward today on those charges.” Read Next 'Nepal mutation' cited as UK renews Portugal travel restri...

520,https://www.rawstory.com/texas-republican-leaders-promised-action-on-gun-safety-after-the-el-paso-shooting-instead-they-passed-permitless-carry/,"Sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. There was hope in the air when state lawmakers from El Paso arrived in Austin for the 2021 Texas Legislature. For them, this was going to be the year they passed substantive firearm restrictions in gun-loving Texas — an unreachable, unfathomable goal for any other Legislative session. But this wasn't just any session. It was lawmakers' first gathering since 2019, when 30 people were killed and dozens more were injured in back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Midland-Odessa. The tragedies were so earth-shattering that they moved Texas' Republican leaders at the time to express an uncharacteristic openness to some gun control measures backed by Democrats. Gov. Greg Abbott swore to do ""everything we can to make sure a crime like this doesn't happen again,"" proposing a slew of policies to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and other people who should not possess them. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick famously said he was ""willing to take an arrow"" from the National Rifle Association in order to pursue stronger background check laws. What happened instead was a whiplash-inducing pivot in the opposite direction. The Legislature, which ended its work Monday, passed House Bill 1927, allowing Texans to carry handguns without a license or training — an expansion of gun rights so divisive Republican leaders in previous years refused to touch it. Law enforcement groups vocally opposed the measure, worried it would endanger officers and citizens and make it easier for criminals to get guns. Abbott touted that the bill was ""the strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history."" For El Paso lawmakers who spent days with Abbott, Patrick and others brokering gun safety compromises in the weeks following the attack on their hometown, it was a slap in the face. Gov. Greg Abbott prayed at a vigil in the wake of the Walmart shooting in El Paso in August of 2019. Credit: Ivan Pierre Aguirre for The Texas Tribune ""We're not living up to the work that we did in the aftermath of those shootings, and quite frankly, it's been forgotten,"" said El Paso Sen. César Blanco, one of several Democrats who pushed for gun restrictions after the Walmart shooting when a gunman killed 23 people. The shooter posted a racist manifesto online shortly before the attack, admitting he was targeting Mexicans. ""My best hope was to pass a lot of these sensible bills to keep our community safe, but [permitless carry] drastically moves the goal posts."" After the shootings, both Abbott and Patrick raised concerns about state laws allowing private gun sales between strangers without background checks. Democrats called for a special session in 2019 to address gun violence, hoping to capitalize while they had Abbott's and Patrick's attention. But the special session never materialized, forcing lawmakers to wait more than a year to file dozens of bills in response to the shootings. Their efforts floundered. As expected, proposals to restrict assault weapons got little traction in the Legislature. Neither did bills to implement ""red flag"" laws that allow courts to order the surrender or seizure of guns from people deemed dangerous. But more frustrating to Democrats was that other measures stalled which Abbott and Patrick had previously expressed support for, including bills to tighten the state's background check laws and crack down on lost or stolen guns. By the end of the session, the Legislature passed only two of the key gun safety bills written by Midland-Odessa and El Paso lawmakers — one to create a statewide active shooter alert system and another measure called the ""lie and try"" bill that makes it a state crime to lie to on a background check form to illegally buy a gun. Both have been signed into law by Abbott. El Paso Democrats and gun control groups say those are good policies but that lawmakers should have done more. ""All [El Paso community members] wanted was something better. All they wanted was some accountability. Yet here we are,"" state Rep. Joe Moody, D-El Paso, told colleagues on the floor before the House approved a deal on the permitless carry bill. ""When the doors were closed, I heard lots of promises. I haven't heard them since."" Adding insult to injury for the Democrats, Abbott championed the ""Second Amendment sanctuary state"" bill that lawmakers passed. It was branded as a way to shield Texas from gun laws that could potentially be passed at the federal level, such as mandatory background checks for private gun sales. Abbott in 2019 stopped short of Patrick's push for mandatory background checks on private stranger-to-stranger sales, but he suggested the Legislature consider ways to make voluntary background checks for such sales easy and affordable. The ""Second Amendment sanctuary state"" bill prohibits state agencies and local governments from enforcing certain new federal gun rules — though legal experts say the move is largely symbolic. Laying out his legislative priorities in February, Abbott made no mention of either shooting. ""We need to erect a complete barrier against any government official anywhere from treading on gun rights in Texas,"" Abbott said during his speech. Lawmakers this year also doubled down on gun rights when they approved bills that would eliminate the governor's power to ban gun sales during an emergency, prohibit big state and local government contracts ""that discriminate against the firearm or ammunition industries"" and make it legal for gun owners to bring weapons into their hotel rooms. The Legislature also passed a measure which failed in 2019 to allow school boards to let school marshals carry guns on their person instead of being required to keep them locked up, among other gun rights proposals. The House approved a bill to allow election judges to carry a gun in most polling places, though it failed to gain traction in the Senate. Asked how Abbott squares passing policies to expand and protect gun rights with his vows to prevent future tragedies like the ones in El Paso and Midland-Odessa, spokesperson Renae Eze said the governor ""took decisive action"" after the 2019 shootings, ""directing state law enforcement to enhance anti-mass violence measures through eight executive orders and supporting [the Department of Public safety's] safe gun storage campaign."" Roundtable meetings with Democrats and gun safety advocates culminated with Abbott's 2019 Texas Safety Action Report, which recommended the Legislature consider several items including banning ""straw purchases,"" where someone buys a gun for someone else, and cracking down on criminals who try to illegally buy or possess guns. ""Many of those have been taken up by the Legislature this session, including bills that would codify actions taken by the Governor and the Office of Court Administration following the report,"" Eze said in an email. ""The Governor will continue working with the Legislature and taking action, as laid out in the recent Texas Homeland Security Strategic Plan, to protect all in the Lone Star State."" Asked which specific items based on Abbott's report were taken up, Eze did not respond. Of the items recommended in Abbott's report, the ""lie and try"" legislation — written by Blanco and sponsored by Republican state Rep. Charlie Geren — appears to be the only one that passed. Before passing permitless carry earlier this month, the Texas Senate rejected a number of Blanco's amendments that would have codified Abbott's recommended gun safety proposals after the 2019 shootings. The amendments would have required background checks for gun sales between strangers, required courts to notify criminals that they may no longer possess a firearm and incentivized the reporting of lost or stolen guns, among other changes. Patrick, who presides over the Senate, did not respond to requests for comment. Blanco said he's been perplexed as to why Republicans wouldn't budge on measures Abbott backed. ""We have a report that gives recommendations. I've filed those recommendations as bills, I filed those recommendations as amendments,"" Blanco said. ""These were non-partisan, common sense solutions that came out of the Governor's office. I figured there would be consensus."" The crusade this year to expand and protect gun rights in Texas came as GOP lawmakers fell in line with the most conservative wing of the Republican party, focused on staving off challenges from the right during the 2022 primary elections. Abbott, Patrick and other Republicans who were initially noncommittal about permitless carry were under immense political pressure this session from conservatives and gun rights advocates, who have long lobbied the Legislature for the bill but struggled to win support. ""By working together, the House and Senate will send Gov. Abbott the strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history, and protect the right of law-abiding Texans to carry a handgun as they exercise their God-given right to self-defense and the defense of their families,"" the bill's author, state Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, said in a May 21 statement. Abbott has yet to sign the bill into law, though he has said he plans to. Current law requires Texans to be licensed to carry handguns openly or concealed. Applicants must submit fingerprints, complete four to six hours of training, and pass a written exam and a shooting proficiency test. Texas does not require a license to openly carry a rifle in public. The measure saw a breakthrough in April when the House passed the permitless carry bill. Patrick initially said the Senate did not have the votes for permitless carry, but he later created a new committee, referred HB 1927 to it and got the bill to the floor, where it passed last month. ""This is our first session since those tragedies, and this is our response: A bill to allow permitless carry,"" state Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, said on the floor May 23. ""A bill to say you don't have to have any training to carry a handgun in the state of Texas. And I can't imagine a worse slap in the face to all those people who have advocated, to the victims and to the family of those victims."" Fueling Texas Republicans' push for permitless carry and other deeply conservative legislation that has historically failed is a byproduct of the 2020 election, when Democrats swept the White House and U.S. Congress but Republicans maintained control of the Texas House, said James Henson, head of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. Proponents of what Republicans call ""constitutional carry"" argued that Texas should follow the lead of at least 20 other states with similar laws on the books. The current pressure on Republican incumbents to fend off a potential primary challenge in 2022 is ""much more immediate than the kind of pressures they felt from an increasingly organized gun safety movement that doesn't have much of a presence or exert much force in Republican politics,"" Henson said. A solid majority of Texas voters don't think permitless carry should be allowed, according to the May University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. El Paso lawmakers are notching as a ""rare win"" the passage of the ""lie and try"" bill that would make it a crime in Texas to lie on a background check form to illegally buy a gun. The action is already illegal under federal law, but the cases are rarely prosecuted. ""We have accomplished something in an environment where we have never passed gun safety measures,"" Moody said. ""While some, including myself, will be critical that there were other things we could have fixed … because of the culture in Texas politics around weapons, it's going to take time."" Three-fourths of the state's voters believe Texas should require criminal and mental background checks before any gun sales, including those at gun shows and private transactions, according to the May UT/TT Poll. Only 18% oppose such checks. Republican lawmakers from the Midland-Odessa region, where seven people were killed in a mass shooting four weeks after El Paso, took a different approach to gun violence prevention this session. A bill by Odessa Rep. Brooks Landgraf to establish the Texas Active Shooter Alert System sailed through the Capitol, never receiving a single negative vote. Landgraf said the system could have alerted community members to the gunman's shooting rampage.

The bill by Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat from San Rafael, would have imposed a 10% tax on the sales price of handguns and an 11% tax on the sales price of rifles, precursor parts and ammunition. The tax would have applied to retailers, not consumers. But a legislative analysis of the bill said retailers could have passed that cost along to buyers. The Assembly Appropriations Committee estimated it would have generated $118 million per year, with the money going toward gun violence prevention programs and research. A majority of the Assembly’s 80 members voted for the bill. But because the bill would create a new tax, it required a two-thirds vote. The bill fell five votes short of the 54 required for passage. Democrats control 59 votes. But several Democrats come from more moderate districts, making a tax increase on guns a tough vote for them. Despite the bill’s failure on Thursday, Levine said he believes it’s possible to revive the legislation later this year. “California is in the midst of a gun violence epidemic that will only end when our leaders have the courage to do what is right and necessary to end it,” Levine said. The vote comes one week after nine people were killed in a mass shooting at Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard in San Jose, California. Assemblyman Alex Lee, a Democrat from San Jose, read the names of each victim on the Assembly floor as he urged his colleagues to support the bill. “We continue to see the breaking news headlines of yet another mass shooting in our nation on a nearly weekly basis.

The federal government never disclosed that customs agents reportedly found terrorist literature and notes detailing hatred for the transit agency in Cassidy’s possession five years ago, Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said. The 57-year-old light rail mechanic was virtually unknown to local law enforcement until he opened fire on his colleagues last Wednesday, killing nine people in the deadliest mass shooting in Bay Area history. “Had this information been shared with local law enforcement, there would have been an intervention with Mr. Cassidy,” Rosen said in an interview with this news organization. “After speaking with Mr. Cassidy, there may at that point have been enough evidence for a gun-violence restraining order, there may have been information for them to refer Mr. Cassidy to mental-health services or some other therapeutic alternative.” Under California’s “red flag” law, such a restraining order allows law enforcement to seize a person’s firearms if they can cite reasonable grounds that person poses a significant danger. Rosen added: “Could that intervention have put Mr. Cassidy on a different path such that he didn’t murder his coworkers? We’ll never know because we were not provided that information.” Rosen said his office continues to seek details from the Department of Homeland Security about what federal customs agents learned when they detained Cassidy upon his return from a trip to the Philippines in 2016. According to a DHS memo circulated after the shooting last Wednesday and obtained by the Wall Street Journal, agents found Cassidy with “books about terrorism and fear and manifestos … as well as a black memo book filled with lots of notes about how he hates the VTA.” San Jose police and Rosen’s office have confirmed that they were never notified about the incident. DHS has not responded to repeated requests for comment over the last several days. “We’re in the process of figuring out why they stopped him and what they found,” Rosen said. “I want to know why the information was not shared with local law enforcement. And will Customs and Border Protection act differently in the future? I’m in the process of getting answers to those questions.” If San Jose police had been alerted to the circumstances of Cassidy’s detainment, police said, investigators would have performed a threat assessment including a criminal background check, evaluation of any threatening social media messages, and an inventory of any registered firearms in Cassidy’s possession as well as any specific skills indicating proficiency with weapons, explosives, or both. In the wake of the shooting at the San Jose light rail yard, investigators have found that Cassidy amassed a large cache of weapons — including three handguns and 32 high-capacity magazines he was carrying with him when he carried out the massacre, as well as a dozen firearms including rifles, shotguns and handguns, improvised explosives and more than 25,000 rounds of ammunition found at his home. The guns were legal, but the high-capacity magazines were not. Use of the red flag law has increased steadily, with 1,110 requests to remove a person’s firearms filed in 2019, according to the state Department of Justice. In some cases, the law allows citizens to file such requests, which must be approved by a judge. In Santa Clara County, that jump was from seven in 2016 to 122 in 2019. San Jose is the largest applicant of the orders in Santa Clara County, in part because it has the largest portion of the region’s population. Local authorities have credited the law with disrupting potential threats, including several people who hinted at workplace shootings, and in some cases their guns were returned after a judge deemed that they were not an ongoing danger. Although current federal officials have remained mum about their encounter with Cassidy, John Sandweg, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told this news organization that there are no specific procedures for what customs officials are supposed to do when they detain a U.S. citizen with potentially deadly intentions. Sandweg said that, generally, unless there’s an imminent threat, Customs and Border Patrol agents would just record details of the encounter in the Treasury Enforcement Communications System, a database accessible to federal agencies. The agents might also flag the FBI but not typically local or state authorities. “There’s just not as much coordination or interaction between the customs officers … and local law enforcement,” he said. “A U.S. citizen presenting a threat like this is just very unusual.” Depending on what materials Cassidy was detained with, it’s possible they were flagged as terror-affiliated but still didn’t merit a warning to the FBI, according to agency spokesperson Prentice Danner. “If it were just literature and it wasn’t a specific threat that would not necessarily be flagged to us,” he said. But the nature of what CBP agents found on Cassidy — including his comments about his hatred for the VTA in interviews with agents — should have been enough to warrant a heads up to local law enforcement agencies, Rosen said. “It may not be a crime to have books about terrorism and to have notes about how you hate your coworkers, not in and of itself,” Rosen said. “However, it certainly warrants intervention from law enforcement to determine if he was planning a mass shooting.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",2021-06-04 08:00:32,Santa Clara County DA: VTA shooter could have been stopped if feds told local authorities about prior detention,,27512,http://www.ibabuzz.com/insider/

525,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/653949982/0/phoenix/nation~Mass-shootings-turn-Americas-gun-culture-into-a-killing-culture/,"Lost amid the weekly spasms of gun violence  – the latest a shooting spree outside a Miami-area banquet hall early Sunday that left two dead and 21 wounded – are the numbers documenting America's unique love affair with firearms. Whether the result of a constitutionally guaranteed right to own a gun, or a natural consequence of a U.S. history forged by conflict and rugged individualism, or both, USA's gun culture is without peer. There are more guns than people in the United States, with 121 firearms for every 100 residents, (although the weapons are concentrated in about a third of U.S. households.) America has less than 5% of the world's population but about 40% of privately owned guns. War-torn Yemen holds second place, with 53 firearms per 100 people. And gun ownership in the USA is rising rapidly. During the socially disruptive pandemic, the federal government tracked gun sales exceeding a million per week  – the first time that benchmark was hit since officials started gathering data in 1998. Whether a corollary to that or not, gun-related homicides and nonsuicide shootings have risen just as fast, with a 25% jump in 2020 over 2019. According to an analysis by the gun-control group Everytown, firearm deaths of all types last year will likely exceed 40,000 –  marking 2020 with the highest gun-related death rate in two decades. About three-quarters of U.S. homicides are related to firearms, a gun-killing ratio that far surpasses Canada (39%), Australia (22%) and England and Wales (4%). The same pattern is borne out within the USA, where states with the most gun ownership have recorded the highest rate of firearm-related deaths, though most of the difference is driven by suicides. While not the means by which most gun deaths occur in America, mass shootings are traumatizing, high-profile tragedies that lately have become numbingly routine. The Miami-area incident came just days after a mass shooting in San Jose, California, where a gunman fatally shot nine before killing himself. Six weeks before that, nine died in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. And there were four killed in Orange, California, March 31; 10 in Boulder, Colorado, March 22; and eight in Atlanta on March 16. In fact, eight of the 15 worst mass shootings in the United States have been in the past decade. America's culture of guns has become a culture of killing. This Editorial Board has long supported sensible gun control laws such as closing the gun-show loophole by expanding background checks (favored by 81% of Americans), banning high-capacity magazines (favored by 64%) and banning assault-style rifles (63%). President Joe Biden has lately taken modest gun-control steps through executive action, most notably cracking down on homemade firearms known as ghost guns. But truly effective change is possible only through federal legislation. Sensible restrictions imposed by individual cities or states can be blunted by relaxed access to guns in neighboring areas. Biden has a legislative wish list that includes expanding background checks and banning assault-style rifles. But there seems less appetite than ever in Congress for tightening gun laws. Pew Research polling shows that rank-and-file Republicans have grown even more recalcitrant about reform. For example, only 37% support banning assault-style rifles  – the weapon of choice for mass shootings – down from 54% in 2017 and 50% in 2019. There was a time when it was thought that a single horrible event, such as the slaughter of first-graders in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, could spur Congress to act. That hasn't happened. Now mass shootings seem to be happening at a harrowing pace. Will lawmakers continue to remain unaffected? Or perhaps Americans' love of guns is just too strong.

529,https://www.aol.com/news/police-third-victim-dies-miami-120624502-141323283.html," MIAMI (AP) — Police in South Florida announced “Operation Summer Heat” to combat escalating gun violence as a third person died from a gunshot wound suffered during a mass shooting outside a banquet hall near Miami. Shankquia Peterson, 32, died on Thursday afternoon, Miami-Dade police said in a news release. She was among the 23 people shot early Sunday during a rapper’s album release party at the El Mula Banquet Hall. Two of the victims remained in critical condition at a hospital, police said. Other gun violence over the past week included a car chase and shooting near a Miami casino, a mass shooting in Wynwood that left one dead and six wounded and a shooting outside a South Beach restaurant that left a man paralyzed and a rapper behind bars. The motive for the banquet hall shooting is still unknown, but investigators were focusing on social-media feuds involving the local rappers who hosted the show, the Miami Herald reported. This includes two rival groups whose tensions go back years and have been fueled by threats made online and in rap lyrics, according to the Herald. “A lot of these violent acts you’re seeing on their social media. You’re seeing them call each other out, they’re giving verbal cues,” Miami-Dade Police Director Alfredo “Freddy” Ramirez said during Thursday’s press conference. “Some of the songs have verbal cues that are triggering rolling violence, real-time violence. Back in the ’90s it was drug turf wars. Here it’s a little bit of that but a lot of it is showing off.” Peterson's relatives told news outlets she had a bullet lodged in her head and had been in a medically induced coma since the shooting. “Our family wants the gun violence to end, for these predators to be caught. This shooting has shaken the family to its core,” Peterson's family said in a statement. Two 26-year-old men, Desmond Owens and Clayton Dillard III, also died in the banquet hall shooting. Police said they've confirmed there were multiple shooters “from various locations"" outside the banquet hall. Surveillance video shows some of the shooters arrived in a Nissan Pathfinder late Saturday night and parked close to banquet hall. The video shows three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two carried what police described as “assault-style rifles.” Another video showed another person shooting from a different angle, news outlets reported. The crowd had been waiting to get inside for an album release party by Courtney Paul Wilson, 24, better known as rapper ABMG Spitta. Authorities said the suspects began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, but had specific targets in mind. The Pathfinder had been reported stolen earlier, and was found Monday submerged in a canal several miles away.

The California Assembly on Thursday failed to pass a bill that would have raised taxes on handguns and ammunition. The bill by Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat from San Rafael, would have imposed a 10% tax on the sales price of handguns and an 11% tax on the sales price of rifles, precursor parts and ammunition. The tax would have applied to retailers, not consumers. But a legislative analysis of the bill said retailers could have passed that cost along to buyers. The Assembly Appropriations Committee estimated it would have generated $118 million per year, with the money going toward gun violence prevention programs and research. A majority of the Assembly’s 80 members voted for the bill. But because the bill would create a new tax, it required a two-thirds vote. The bill fell five votes short of the 54 required for passage. Democrats control 59 votes. But several Democrats come from more moderate districts, making a tax increase on guns a tough vote for them. LA COUNTY DA GASCON'S PROGRESSIVE POLICIES DRAW ‘NO CONFIDENCE’ VOTES FROM 17 CITIES Despite the bill’s failure on Thursday, Levine said he believes it’s possible to revive the legislation later this year. ""California is in the midst of a gun violence epidemic that will only end when our leaders have the courage to do what is right and necessary to end it,"" Levine said. The vote comes one week after nine people were killed in a mass shooting at Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard in San Jose, California. Assemblyman Alex Lee, a Democrat from San Jose, read the names of each victim on the Assembly floor as he urged his colleagues to support the bill. ""We continue to see the breaking news headlines of yet another mass shooting in our nation on a nearly weekly basis. And frankly, I’m sick of it,"" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a letter to lawmakers, the pro-gun group Gun Owners of California wrote that the bill wasn’t fair because it sought to ""penalize the lawful for the misdeeds of the unlawful.′ Levine, the author of the bill, said his goal was in part a response to the increase in gun sales and gun violence since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. California already imposes a fee of $37.19 on gun sales, which includes a fee for background checks.

Police have made no arrests. Ashley Gantt, who is a cousin of one of the three victims — Desmond Owens — and also is representing his family as an attorney, issued a “call to action to speak up and say something"" on what they know about the Memorial Day weekend shootings. “It was so many people, friends, loved ones,"" she said. “The pain and the suffering is reverberating throughout our community. No one deserves to lose their loved ones like this in such a senseless act.” Police have said they're focusing on a rivalry between local rappers in their investigation. But Miami-Dade County’s top prosecutor, Katherine Rundle, indicated that there's been a hesitancy among members of the community to come forward with tips because of a climate of violent retribution for turncoats and a general mistrust in law enforcement. “You’ve got to give us information. I know there’s a lot of talk of people who live in fear of retaliation, but we do have victim protection procedures,” Rundle said. “People want us to get the killers and guns off the street and people want to be safe ... We hear you, but we need you.” Top county officials also have launched what they call “Operation Summer Heat” to combat gun crime and deter what they anticipate will be a violent season ahead as the region comes out of the pandemic. They described it at a news conference Thursday as a 12-week period of boosted cooperation and information-sharing among law enforcement agencies, scouring of social media and heightened enforcement of local codes to shut establishments deemed hotbeds of crime. Officials overnight confirmed that a third victim had died from the shootings, identifying her as Shankquia Peterson, 32. Two other victims in the shooting remained in critical condition, police said. Surveillance videos released by police show a white SUV driving into an alley before three masked gunmen spray bullets indiscriminately into the crowd early Sunday.

Officials said the shooting Thursday was located a block away from the Valley Transportation Authority, but the two incidents are not believed to be related.
Advertisement Police said Thursday's shooting killed one person, a man. ""This is an isolated incident. It's, unfortunately, a very bad coincidence,"" San Jose Police Department spokesperson Christian Camarillo said, according to KGO-TV. Meanwhile, authorities are still investigating the mass shooting last week at the VTA. The gunman, Samuel Cassidy, killed himself at the scene before police reached him. Officials released dramatic body camera footage earlier this week. Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said Thursday night that the attack might have been prevented if federal authorities had given local police information about Cassidy. Homeland Security agents detained Cassidy in 2016 after a trip to the Philippines and later found books on terrorism and unspecified manifestos in his possession, as well as notes expressing hate toward the VTA, where he worked. Rosen said the findings could have been enough to activate California's ""red flag"" law, which allows police to confiscate weapons and referred a potentially dangerous person for mental health services.",2021-06-04 11:23:32,Man killed in shooting near San Jose rail yard where 9 died last week,,1706,http://www.upi.com/

On Wednesday, DeSantis vetoed almost a million dollars in funding for LGBT residents of his state from the state’s budget, including $150,000 earmarked for mental health services for survivors of the Pulse massacre. In a particularly cruel twist, DeSantis’s veto came just days before the fifth anniversary of the mass shooting at the Orlando nightclub. Given that the state’s budget is a record $100 billion this year, $150,000 doesn’t even count as a drop in the bucket. But it is a lot of money for the LGBT community center that is serving the survivors of the mass shooting. More, via the Washington Post: But staff at the LGBT+ Center Orlando, which lost the $150,000 in state funding, said the governor’s veto would definitely hurt Pulse survivors and other LGBT residents in the area. Joél Morales, the Center Orlando’s director of operations, said that earlier this year, the center took over a counseling services program offered to Pulse survivors and the families of those killed. A federal grant had previously paid for similar services in the state, but it ended in 2019. Without state funding, the center can’t afford to keep running the program, which currently serves 68 families and survivors. “We only requested $150,000, which is the bare minimum to just sustain the program as it is,” Morales told The Post. Morales added, “It was a slap in the face. I bawled just because of all the hard work our community is doing and the healing that still needs to be done.” While DeSantis’s office claims that this funding cut won’t impact Pulse survivors, pointing to an overall increase in funding for mental health services in the budget, there’s no guarantee that any of that funding will go to this specific program. As one survivor, Brandon Wolf, told the Post, “How much of it is going to these survivors? They have not been able to answer that question. It’s shameful.” The counseling program wasn’t the only program DeSantis decided to gut. He also vetoed $750,000 for the Zebra Coalition, an Orlando-based group that is building housing for homeless LGBT youth. As the Zebra Coalition wrote in a statement, much of the funding would have gone to a project to turn a former motel into housing for 35 young people. “The veto creates significant obstacles toward our goal to ensure that all LGBTQ+ youth have a safe place to call home,” the group’s executive director wrote. Congrats to DeSantis for deciding Pride was the perfect time to take a big dump on survivors of a mass shooting and on homeless queer youth. I defy anyone to explain what the modern day GOP has actually done for anyone other than cause hardship and suffering for people who aren’t rich, straight, white CEOs and the companies they run.",2021-06-04 10:30:00,"Ron DeSantis Celebrates Pride By Gutting Mental Health Program for Pulse Shooting Survivors, Housing For Homeless LGBT Youth",,6154,http://jezebel.com
534,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/04/colorado-gun-bills-laws-2021-legislature/,"Trending: Colorado lawmakers have passed six gun bills, coming on the heels of at least two of its deadliest mass shootings this year. The House gave final approval Monday night to HB21-1298, a bill to expand background checks for gun purchases and attempt to close loopholes. It was part of a package of three gun bills that Democratic lawmakers introduced after the Boulder King Soopers shooting. The others that will be sent to Gov. Jared Polis are SB21-256, a bill that would allow local governments to enact stricter gun laws than the state’s, and HB21-1299, which would create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention. “Every year, it seems we are shocked by a horrific mass shooting that shakes us to our core. But it’s the countless other shootings happening every day that represent the deadliest component of this crisis,” Lakewood Democratic Sen. Brittany Pettersen said in a statement this week. Republicans in both chambers opposed the gun bills, saying they were not getting at the root of the problem. It’s why GOP Rep. Dave Williams of Colorado Springs doesn’t believe the bills will reduce crime, either. He called the gun legislation an overreach by Democrats and said “all these measures do is punish law-abiding citizens who want to defend themselves and they empower criminals who endanger our neighborhoods.” Prior to the shooting, lawmakers were considering three other gun bills, two of which have since been signed into law. HB21-1106 requires the safe storage of guns in homes to ensure that minors and people not allowed to have guns don’t have access to them. SB21-078 requires lost or stolen firearms be reported to authorities within five days of finding out they’re gone. The last of the original three, HB21-1255, is aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers; it is also headed to Polis’ desk.

535,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/47sNXqPZso8/,"In the year and a half since the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset, gun violence has skyrocketed across the U.S., even with nationwide lockdown procedures, social distancing mandates and attempts to limit interactions between individuals. Now, cities and states across the country are beginning to lift their COVID-19 restrictions amid vaccine rollouts and cases dropping. Summer weather is approaching, and more and more people are outside—in many cases, having to relearn social behaviors and co-exist in public spaces amid a time of heightened tension, divisions and incendiary political rhetoric. And with gun violence typically increasing in the summer months, experts are raising concerns that the season will see a further rise in shootings and gun crimes. “We’re fearful of what this summer is going to look like,” Paul Carrillo, Community Violence Initiative Director at the Giffords Law Center tells TIME. “I’m fearful that people are still going to be carrying some of the anger and despair that we’ve all dealt with this past year.” Carrillo, who has been worked in the violence interruption field for over a decade, cites the potential for volatile situations to escalate rapidly as Americans begin to re-socialize and come into contact with each other. This could be the case in particular for young people, he tells TIME, for whom conflicts aired over social media or through intermediaries could easily become dangerous in face-to-face environments. (This example fits into the broader context of endemic gun violence, as opposed to larger-scale mass shootings, though the latter category has also been on the rise in recent months.) Read more: What Counts as a Mass Shooting? Why So Much of America’s Gun Violence Gets Overlooked 2020 was one of the worst years for gun violence on record in America. That surge hasn’t slowed down in 2021. More than 8,200 people—a number that represents those who have been victims of homicides and unintentional shootings—have been killed this year as of June 3, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA). Last year, that total number of fatalities was 19,402; in 2019, it was 15,447. And in the first three months of 2021, the homicide rate in many larger cities increased by over 20% compared to the same time period last year, according to the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice (NCCCJ). Gun assault rates also increased by 22%. Over Memorial Day weekend, traditionally seen as the beginning of the summer months, a mass shooting in Miami outside a banquet hall left two people dead and 23 people shot; video of the incident shows a crowd of people waiting outside of the venue as three men got out of a vehicle with weapons and open fire. No arrests have been made. In New York City, there were nine shooting incidents on Memorial Day itself—with 12 people were reportedly shot over a six-hour period. In Philadelphia, 16 people were shot over the holiday weekend. There were multiple shooting incidents reported in Houston and Dallas. Overall there were more than 100 shooting victims across the country during the long holiday weekend. That grim figure is not an outlier by any means, but the latest tally in a consistent trend of deadly weekends—and weekdays—across the U.S. Experts have pointed to a variety of factors for the recent increase in gun violence, including the pandemic’s socio-economic impacts, tensions that have flared between minority communities and the police as well as a rise in firearm purchases—though this increase has been more so attributed to those who were already gun owners than new buyers. These trends have ramifications at both the national and local levels and are not easily resolved. “Economic stress is always an important factor in violence, and the pandemic produced tremendous stress,” Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University says of the COVID-induced financial hardships many Americans now struggle with. “We haven’t gotten out of the economic consequences of the pandemic yet.” Specific to urban communities that often struggle with daily gun violence, activists are also concerned that many summer youth programs will be functioning with limited resources this year—if they’re open at all. This will mean less support for vulnerable communities at a time when it is sorely needed, and for the most vulnerable members thereof also. Unfortunately, it’s often at-risk youth in marginalized neighborhoods who are enticed by gangs and fall into violent behavior patterns. “The kids that need the most services are the first ones to get kicked out,” Carrillo says—a problem set to be exacerbated in the coming months. “There are too many people that want to push youth programs, which is great and needed, but not many people specialize in the hard to reach kids.” On April 7, President Biden announced a new drive to combat gun violence, calling the problem a “public health epidemic.” Along with committing to curb gun trafficking and address some loopholes in gun laws, the administration also promised to invest in community-based violence intervention initiatives. This is something activists have long called for, particularly the implementation of programs using credible street and outreach workers to quell conflicts between gangs. But with bills on gun reform stuck in Congress, it is most likely, at least for now, that Americans will bear both the brunt of continued, devastating violence, and the work needed to prevent or curtail it. Despite his fears, Carrillo still hopes for a summer in which Americans can find moments to relax and recuperate. “I hope that people feel a sense of relief from the pandemic and the worrying, and the uncertainty and the illnesses and everything that came with it,” he says. “I hope that [people] just kind of exhale, and just chill out.” Write to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.",2021-06-04 12:46:30,"As Shootings Continues to Surge in 2021, Americans Set to Face a Summer Plagued by Gun Violence",,4419,http://time.com

Overall, 17 employees of the department left between May 2020 and June 2021. ""It is a concern of ours. It is a challenge,"" said Wauwatosa interim police chief Luke Vetter during a Tuesday committee of the whole meeting. ""We know we need to get on top of it. We need to fill a lot of rank positions here in order to get the proper staffing to what you have authorized us to be at."" An annual report said the department saw an ""extraordinary amount of turnover"" in the last year. Some of the turnover in the last year is due to retirements and resignations. Numerous command staff changes in the department also occurred in the last year. Barry Weber retired as the longtime police chief June 1. Currently, the department has 90 sworn officers, even though it's authorized to employ 100. Of those 90, only 79 are currently working. That's because four officers are injured, three are on family and medical leave, one officer is on administrative duty, one officer is on military duty and two others are in field training. From 2018-21, the department hired 28 new officers. Of those 28, only 19 are still with the department. Wauwatosa Police Capt. Gary Gabrish didn't give a specific reason as to why officers and employees are leaving. But he did say some have left to take new jobs at other law enforcement agencies. ""A lot of that is for positive reasons, not exactly negative reasons for leaving,"" Gabrish said. Other employees who have left include supervisors, clerks, dispatchers and parking specialists. RELATED: Here's a list of police reforms being undertaken in Milwaukee since the death of George Floyd one year ago But a recent letter from the president of the Wauwatosa police union said morale is ""plummeting"" within the department. Wauwatosa also saw a high number of protests focused on reform within the police department in 2020 after former Wauwatosa Police Officer Joseph Mensah shot and killed 17-year-old Alvin Cole in February. Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, said he thinks officer shortages are part of a larger problem being seen across the state and nation. ""It is entirely consistent with what we're seeing across the state,"" Palmer said. Although the WPPA does not represent the Wauwatosa Police Department, Palmer said he's heard from other departments that are having fewer applications for new positions. Other departments across the nation are also facing recruitment and retention issues. ""It's a very serious problem,"" Palmer added. RELATED: Some Milwaukee area police departments are still without body cameras. Cost remains the biggest setback. Even as the department is facing shortages, Gabrish said, the current employees with the department want to stay there. ""I will assure you that our sworn and non-sworn personnel that are here, they want to be here,"" Gabrish said. ""They want to serve and continue to protect this community."" Gabrish said he thinks there's generally been a decrease in the popularity of a career in law enforcement. The department is conducting research to better recruit, retain and hire officers. The department is actively recruiting more officers now as well. ""We have to remain competitive with other law enforcement agencies in terms of benefits, pay and training, community involvement and equipment,"" Gabrish said. Palmer also said departments should be proactive with positive messaging that can help curb the decline. Active recruitment could also help, Palmer said.

Police have made no arrests. Ashley Gannt, who is a cousin of one of the three victims — Desmond Grant — and also is representing his family as an attorney, issued a “call to action to speak up and say something” on what they know about the Memorial Day weekend shootings. “It was so many people, friends, loved ones,” she said. “The pain and the suffering is reverberating throughout our community. No one deserves to lose their loved ones like this in such a senseless act.” Police have said they’re focusing on a rivalry between local rappers in their investigation. But Miami-Dade County’s top prosecutor, Katherine Rundle, indicated that there’s been a hesitancy among members of the community to come forward with tips because of a climate of violent retribution for turncoats and a general mistrust in law enforcement. “You’ve got to give us information. I know there’s a lot of talk of people who live in fear of retaliation, but we do have victim protection procedures,” Rundle said. “People want us to get the killers and guns off the street and people want to be safe ... We hear you, but we need you.” Top county officials also have launched what they call “Operation Summer Heat” to combat gun crime and deter what they anticipate will be a violent season ahead as the region comes out of the pandemic. They described it at a news conference Thursday as a 12-week period of boosted cooperation and information-sharing among law enforcement agencies, scouring of social media and heightened enforcement of local codes to shut establishments deemed hotbeds of crime. Officials overnight confirmed that a third victim had died from the shootings, identifying her as Shankquia Peterson, 32. Two other victims in the shooting remained in critical condition, police said. Surveillance videos released by police show a white SUV driving into an alley before three masked gunmen spray bullets indiscriminately into the crowd early Sunday. Another video showed another person shooting from a different angle, news outlets reported. Police say the assailants had specific targets in mind. The crowd had been waiting to get inside for an album release party by Courtney Paul Wilson, 24, better known as rapper ABMG Spitta. Relatives of Peterson, the last victim to die, told news outlets she had a bullet lodged in her head and had been in a medically induced coma since the shooting. “Our family wants the gun violence to end, for these predators to be caught. This shooting has shaken the family to its core,” Peterson’s family said in a statement. Other gun violence over Memorial Day weekend included a car chase and shooting near a Miami casino, a mass shooting in Wynwood that left one dead and six wounded and a shooting outside a South Beach restaurant that left a man paralyzed and a local rapper behind bars. While the motive for the banquet hall shooting is still unknown, investigators were focusing on social-media feuds involving the local rappers who hosted the banquet hall show.

542,https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2021/06/04/judge-grants-delay-in-civil-rights-case-over-floyds-death/,"Trending: By Amy Forliti | Associated Press MINNEAPOLIS — A magistrate judge has delayed until September the arraignment of four former Minneapolis police officers charged with federal civil rights violations in George Floyd’s  death, ruling Friday that the case is complex and not subject to time restraints under the Speedy Trial Act. Prosecutors had asked for more time to prepare for the case, due in part to the sheer volume of evidence. Defense attorneys did not oppose the delay. A federal grand jury indicted Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao last month, alleging they violated Floyd’s rights while acting under government authority as Floyd was restrained face-down, handcuffed and not resisting. Chauvin is also charged in a separate indictment alleging he violated the rights of a 14-year-old boy in 2017. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung said the four men would be arraigned Sept. 14, subject to any further orders from the court. A date for trial has not been set. Chauvin has been convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court and is awaiting sentencing in that case. The other former officers also face state trial next March on aiding and abetting counts. Floyd, 46, repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe as Chauvin pinned him to the ground on May 25, 2020. Kueng and Lane helped restrain Floyd — Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back and Lane held Floyd’s legs. Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint that was captured on bystander video and led to worldwide protests and calls for change in policing.

The federal indictment alleges Chauvin violated Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and from unreasonable force by a police officer.

544,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/AXhqdIL-3cg/,"A Texas Sheriff tells Newsy the FBI and U.S. Attorney have taken over the case against a man accused of a plot to carry out a mass shooting at a Wal-Mart. ""He was going to die for the cause and kill some people at Wal-Mart,"" said Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha. ""As you know, nowadays, we just we just couldn't sit. We had to act.” Leitha says the FBI reached out early last week to get local help monitoring 28-year-old Coleman Blevins, who Leitha says told his undercover agent he planned to carry out the assault. Local investigators seized firearms, ammunition and a wide variety of hate group paraphernalia from Blevins' home. Evidence taken included a flag with a swastika and materials from other international entities in Russia and elsewhere, including a flag from La Falange, a Spanish fascist group. The sheriff says Blevins later claimed to have been just researching radical groups. ""This represents the transnational nature of fascism,"" said Alexander Reid Ross, a fellow at the Centre for the Analysis of the Radical Right in the UK. ""It represents the networks that are bound together through the assumptions of collective violence and martyrdom."" Federal intelligence officials warned this spring racially motivated violent extremists are the type of threat ""most likely to conduct mass-casualty attacks against civilians."" Also seized from Blevins' home: A t-shirt with a logo from the Injekt Division, a fascist group which launched a Telegram channel in February.  On the group's channel, members post videos glorifying murder and other violence. Multiple subscribers to the Telegram channel claim the group's president, who goes by the alias ""Korb Taran,"" is in fact Blevins.  In the days since the arrest of Blevins subscribers to the channel have posted pictures of him with calls to ""#FreeKorb."" Newsy has not independently confirmed Korb is Blevins and his appointed public defender would not comment. However, a man going by the name Korb appeared in a Facebook livestream wearing an Injekt Division t-shirt,  while calling for action against perceived enemies. “Do I feel the need to genocide all brown people here today ,"" Korb asked in the video, before going into a detailed answer Newsy has decided not to share.  Newsy brought the stream to Facebook's attention, pointing out that it remained online even a week after the arrest of Blevins.  Within hours, a spokesperson for Facebook said, “We've removed this video for violating our policies against hate speech.” The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on this story. The Kerr County Sheriff said for now, Blevins remains in local custody but said he expects federal charges could be forthcoming against Blevins soon.

545,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Ratifying-Democracy-by-Bob-Passi-Citizens_Community_Courage_Democracy-210604-120.html,"George Floyd Portrait(Image by Dan Lacey from flickr)   Details   DMCA The guilty sentence handed down in the George Floyd murder case is, on its face, a ratification of our basic democratic principles, often followed more by exception than by rule, especially when it comes to racial groups and the poor in U.S. courts. There was much to celebrate with the verdict, but everyone had a strange and eerie feeling that there was another shoe to fall. Was this an indication of a real shift in our dealings with blacks in our courts or was this just an anomaly? The following days and weeks have not provided much clarity. We hoped for the signs within society of a recognition of the past imbalances of justice and some movement redirecting not only policing practices but also dealing with an entire range of social problems, now too often, and inappropriately, left to the police to handle. Unfortunately, we saw, here in Minnesota and across the nation, almost immediately a continuation of police killings of unarmed black citizens. One was left with the haunting concern that some police saw the verdict as an affront and were willing to double down on their present deadly tactics. We also watched as too many on the conservative side, egged on by the Republican Party, which was still too much the party of Trump, began to resist any meaningful change in policing or in national policy. It appeared to be the same-old obstructionist strategies of the past, slowing down any momentum for change, hoping that it would fade away and be satisfied with some mere window-dressing instead of any real change. This brings to mind the hopes for gun control in the face of continuing gun violence in this nation. Gun control gains momentum after each mass shooting with little to no meaningful response. And we watch, again and again as those hopes slowly die, after battering themselves against the unbreachable walls of the conservatives in the US Senate, who are always willing to use the filibuster as a last resort rather than allow any change. Too often we have seen the glimmer of hope for any real ratification of the principles of democracy, which should be the foundation of this nation, being beaten down by the entrenched power of conservative forces who want no change. Instead, we see the return, again and again, to the domination of an entrenched aristocracy of an economic elite. Those forces are too often much more concerned with economics as a way to retain their hegemony than to any concerns for social justice or democratic ideals. This is a part of a narrative that has been foisted upon the unwary citizens of this nation. It is based on an illusion of a world dominated by an innately wise and wealthy, white, male, Christian elite, who have been chosen by the universe or by God to control the rest of the citizens. It is the illusion of White Christian Supremacy with the assumption of inferiority when dealing with other racial, religious, and even ethnic peoples. It is an illusion of a static world and society, with no change possible or even necessary. And as the illusion gets farther away from the observable reality of the world and of the life most people deal with, the justifications get more strained, and the tactics used to sustain those illusions get more extreme. To sustain that illusion you must disregard science, and logic and reports of what is actually happening. You must limit and control education to only allow the indoctrination of that delusional narrative. You must control ideas by controlling the communication media of the nation. You must disregard all but the most fundamentalist Christian beliefs.  And you must justify your actions by economic standards and not by any human standards or by the standards of a democracy. You must rely on imposed solutions handed down from on high, allowing no deviation, with punishment being immediate and harsh. After the ruling of the George Floyd murder case, we, almost immediately, see some states outlawing educational attempts to understand the role of race within our society. We see states restricting voting rights, especially aimed at racial groups. We see an easing of gun controls. And we see a portion of society ready to move into an armed camp to defend the status quo at all costs. But the struggle is not over yet; social justice still has great momentum within the society and will not be easily turned aside by the old solutions of a dying system. The inactivity and frequent obstructionism of factions within governments on the national, or even state level, will not stop this call for change. If it cannot be done with political support on that level, then it will continue to be practiced on the individual and community level. The recent experiences of the pandemic have reminded everyone of how vital and effective individual and community activity can be in sustaining our society. The community is the real representative of the political will of the people, and this will not be stopped by the ""political won't"" of the conservative elements of government. The situation is very much like an old and dying, very powerful and entrenched system, willing, in its death throes, to bring everything down with it, regardless of the consequences.  Those within that system feel like they are fighting some noble and preordained fight for what is good and true. They are sure there is no meaningful life outside the bubble of their illusion. The way past this is to change direction and leave that old system behind with less and less support as their irrelevance becomes more and more apparent and their isolation grows. It is like they have constructed an impenetrable castle in the hopes that it will stand for all time and protect their illusions of a world gone by. That castle is sustained by the support of those who toil outside the walls of the castle, whose purpose, they are told, is to support the needs of the aristocracy within the castle walls. Until, one day that aristocracy, within the castle walls, awakens to a world without sufficient support to sustain that castle. It will become clear that their castle has become as irrelevant as the Maginot Line was to the French when WWII began, and the German invasion simply went around the fortifications of the Maginot Line. That castle will simply be an abandoned artifact of another era and will exist as a monument to past folly. Regardless of what past illusions some in our society are trying frantically to sustain, the need for fairness, inclusivity, racial justice, and the other principles of a democracy will win out if we have the courage to continue on the path of justice and equality to ratify democracy in the face of an old and dying system. The result of the George Floyd murder trial seems to have been to clarify the distinctions between the faction for the old system and a new faction with the courage as individuals and communities to create and ratify a democracy with its actions. A George Floyd Trilogy We have just passed the first anniversary of the killing of George Floyd. This past year, watching events in Minneapolis from my home a bit farther north in Minnesota, I have written articles about the killing of George Floyd, the political implications, and the national and international response. All three have been published online in OpEdNews.com. The first one, ""Catalyst"", was published on June 12, 2020, shortly after the initial event. The second, ""The Soul of American Democracy"", was published on April 10, 2021, as the trial was beginning. This, ""Ratifying Democracy"", will be the third of the trilogy about the results of the trial and about the aftermath of the George Floyd event.  Rate It |

An article on Page 4 this weekend about the diversity of young assistant conductors incorrectly describes the status of Black music directors of top-tier American orchestras. James DePreist was the music director of the Oregon Symphony from 1980 to 2003; it is not the case that there have been no Black music directors in this group. An article on Tuesday about an Arctic station that keeps satellites connected misstated the relationship between the paths of orbiting satellites and the location of ground stations. Because of Earth’s rotation, a station at the Equator, which might have been aligned with a satellite’s orbit when the satellite was crossing the pole, would have rotated far to the east, not the west, by the time it passed overhead. An article on June 8 on Page D1 about diversity and inclusivity in JAMA journals incorrectly described Dr. Mary Bassett’s recollection of her experience submitting a study to the journal JAMA.

547,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/05/surviving-a-school-shooting-northern-illinois-university,"More than a decade later, I can still recall the terror of that day with precise, photographic dread Last modified on Mon 7 Jun 2021 17.37 BST “Somebody’s shooting on campus!” The words ripped my concentration away from my laptop screen. Our law school classroom fell silent. “What should we do?” I asked our professor. He said: “Well, if I were you, I’d run.” I paused to type “There’s a shooter” in a chat box to my husband Aaron before slamming my laptop shut.  I took refuge between stacks in the law library until police said it was safe to leave, hours later. When I walked out of the law school, I heard loud rumbling above me and looked up to see news helicopters circling overhead against a cold, gray sky. Some kind of war had been waged on our campus, and the air was heavy with it. I was going home to my family, but the flashing lights of police cars and ambulances suggested others weren’t. Surviving a school shooting was an initiation of evil. The world didn’t look or feel the same afterward. Its colors were less vivid, and any sense of peace and security that once surrounded me was gone. I knew I’d never exist with quite the same ease again. The trauma of what’s since become known as the Northern Illinois University “Valentine’s Day Massacre” has never left me. More than a decade later, I can still recall the terror of that day with precise, photographic dread. But I’m no longer a 24-year-old student; I’m a 37-year-old mother of three. Despite 12 years and countless other mass shooting incidents across the country, not much has been done by our federal legislators to make anyone safer from gun violence anywhere – let alone at school. One hundred and ninety-four mass shootings occurred in the US this year, with at least 45 in April alone. I assumed the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary shooting would be the wake-up call our country needed to act on gun violence. Multiple school shootings had taken place since the one I experienced in 2008, yet Sandy Hook was the first to invade my consciousness as a mother. I clutched my eight-month-old son to my chest as the precious faces of young children murdered at school cycled across my television screen on the evening news. As tears streamed down my face, my mind tried to reconcile the fact that the victims in these manmade tragedies were no longer limited to teenagers and college students. Little kids were new casualties in our country’s ongoing struggle to define itself. Its endless argument over guns appeared to be a symptom of a national identity crisis between political polar opposites – two parties so ideologically opposed that even the needless deaths of tiny innocents couldn’t bridge the divide between them. What sickened me most, though, wasn’t our government’s failure to prioritize people over partisanship. It was knowing that there were parents who took their kids to school and returned home eternally empty-handed. My stomach churned over whether their children might have experienced some iteration or degree of what I remembered from the NIU shooting: the hell, helplessness and panic of staring at a doorway, wondering if a person on the other side was about to end my life. The only thing worse than knowing those feelings first-hand was wondering how many more children might one day know them, too. So far, hundreds of thousands of American students have been exposed to school shootings, and these incidents have increased in recent years. The human cost of school shootings extends beyond those who are injured or die, negatively affecting the mental health of survivors. According to a 2019 Stanford University study, “local exposure to fatal school shootings increased antidepressant use among youths”. Yet children are not the only ones suffering from this epidemic. Parents are also struggling. Survivors of school shootings like me are now raising kids of their own, worrying they will suffer similar fates. Although the psychological effects of school shootings on parents may not yet be fully known or understood, research suggests that those with loved ones who have been exposed to “assaultive violence” have a higher risk of mental health disorders. Another study found that parents of terrorist survivors were five times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress and three times more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than the population at large. (Mass shootings can be classified as acts of terrorism in many cases.) Like spouses of military veterans, parents of school shooting survivors might also be more susceptible to secondary traumatic stress, especially if they experienced a school shooting themselves or have a history of past trauma. But school shootings may pose mental health risks to all parents, not just those whose children are victims or survivors. One study concluded that acts of terrorism can have detrimental emotional impacts on general populations. School shootings don’t just deprive children of their lives and innocence; they deprive parents of a sense of safety and security their parents and grandparents took for granted. The sanctity and sanctuary of school are long gone. This reality is a painful part of our collective consciousness. We send our kids to school, hoping the horror of gun violence won’t happen there, but knowing no child or school is immune. Carrying this mental load may be commonplace for modern parents, but it doesn’t have to be. Biden recently took executive action to address gun violence, and although Americans are divided on gun policy, strong bipartisan support exists for expanded background checks and preventing the mentally ill from obtaining guns. Measures like these, limiting who has access to firearms, have proven more effective in reducing gun-related deaths than limiting access to specific types of firearms. Precious time has been wasted on political finger-pointing and partisan talking points, particularly when leftists and conservatives have each historically supported and opposed gun control (albeit for morally divergent reasons). Both sides seem content to debate the second amendment and the founders’ intent until they run out of breath. But in the meantime, Congress must come together, in earnest, to find common ground and common-sense solutions to stop this bleeding. The consequences of inaction have become too high – and our kids are counting on them.

Kendra wasn't usually one to get mad, especially not on the job. She'd joined Dollar General in 2019, as a longtime homemaker hoping for a change of pace. She loved chatting with the regulars who filed into her small-town location. She was meticulous about all the little tasks that went into keeping the store clean, organized, and running smoothly. Kendra had even worked her way up to the role of key-holder, the store employee responsible for opening and closing. But then came the coronavirus pandemic, and Kendra began to watch the stress start to ""roll downhill."" The headwaters of the strain seemed to be visits, announcements, or corrections from regional and district management. The negativity seemed to submerge Kendra's store manager, who became overwhelmed and less communicative toward her team. Soon, Kendra herself would find herself drowning in an increasingly fraught work environment. ""By the time you get down to that lowly stay-at-home mom that just wanted a part-time job — who is earning less than a hundred dollars a week because she's making $7.25 an hour and only working 10 hours a week — it's not worth it,"" Kendra told Insider. She says she's not the ""type of person"" who acts out of anger. Yet, in the springtime of 2021, Kendra rage-quit her job. Kendra isn't the Dollar General worker's real name. After verifying her employment records, Insider is protecting Kendra's identity because she is concerned about getting her former boss in trouble with management. She said her manager was a ""good person"" who was simply under pressure. On her last shift, Kendra says, she could tell her store manager was displeased with something. During the pandemic, Kendra said she felt as if she was constantly dealing with passive-aggressive and snide remarks, instead of clear direction. ""It's like, if I've done something wrong, just tell me — you don't have to be mean about it,"" Kendra said. ""Just tell me."" The manager declined to share what the problem was, and the conversation got heated. So Kendra walked out, and never went back. The phenomenon of rage-quitting is as old as work itself. Some people prefer to end things with a bang, not a whimper. So things like bridge-burning, walking off sans a two weeks' notice, or even making a scene are nothing new when leaving a workplace. But the American workforce seems to be primed for rage-quitting at the moment — especially hourly workers in low-wage occupations like retail, which make up a giant portion of the workforce. In fact, hourly workers made up 58.1% of the US workforce in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Recently, multiple Dollar General employees at a store in Maine walked off the job after posting notes decrying the company's work culture and pay. Similar incidents have occurred at Chipotle, Hardee's, and Wendy's locations around the country. At the same time, employers are complaining of a tight labor market, in some cases accusing unemployment benefits of luring workers away. Read more: An economic theory called 'reallocation friction' may explain why employers are having a hard time finding workers — and why a full recovery could be years away But there's also evidence that many hourly wage earners are simply fed up with their jobs. A study from the human-resources assessment platform Traitify found that one in four respondents were at least ""somewhat"" less happy with their job than they were a year ago. Gigs in industries like retail have long been denounced over low pay and high stress. But will the boiled-over rage of workers fresh off a life-altering pandemic — and any resulting labor shortage — finally prompt a major shift in working conditions? The pandemic itself had an outsize influence on workers' decision-making. In some cases, workers who spoke with Insider cited the coronavirus as a primary reason for their unhappiness on the job and their ultimate departure. That was the reasoning behind Crista's choice to depart from their job at PetSmart. Crista is also a member of the labor-rights group United for Respect. ""I was really concerned about bringing COVID home from my place of work,"" they told Insider. Those fears grew as they watched managers and coworkers continually flout mask requirements within the stores, even as COVID-19 deaths spiked. Crista says they found the work environment ""callous."" ""It's definitely hard to report stuff to the boss when the boss is breaking the rules, too,"" they said. Crista lives with their mother, who is 62. Their decision to quit was informed less by ""rage"" than by a deep dread over the prospect of infecting their loved one. Still, it amounted to a hasty departure. Crista can even pinpoint ""the exact moment"" they realized they needed to leave. ""My coworker was talking about how masks are so inconvenient to wear,"" they said. ""And she said, 'If any of y'all get COVID from me, then sorry, not sorry.' So she literally was like: 'Yeah, I don't care if you get sick — I just don't want to wear my mask.'"" After thinking it over at home, they decided the ""amount of pay"" wasn't worth the ""lack of safety."" They called into work to put in their two weeks' notice. ""The team lead said, 'Just write it down on a piece of paper and don't say anything about why,'"" they said. ""I found it very strange and concerning that they would rather not hear why someone found a company to be a bad fit, especially during a global pandemic,"" Crista said. Crista says they went in to hand-deliver the note but couldn't find a manager. They left after situating the letter on a doorknob and never received another call from PetSmart. ""PetSmart should know that there's a huge disconnect between the corporate policies that have been put in place versus what their management and their staff actually do at their stores,"" they said. ""And that there needs to be some oversight and enforcement."" In a statement sent to Insider, a PetSmart representative said the company remained committed to measures like ""enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols, face covering requirements for associates and customers, daily health screening for associates, and many other steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19."" ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our teams and pet parents, and since the beginning of the pandemic, we have continuously directed our stores to adapt business practices to meet or exceed all applicable health and safety guidance, as well as other best practices for retail store operations,"" the person said. ""Additionally, we have significantly invested in personal protective equipment, including cloth face coverings, KN-95 masks and gloves for associates, cleaning supplies, physical barriers in our stores, and other items to protect our associates and customers."" Insider also spoke with Helena, a former employee at a fast-fashion retailer. Insider verified her work history and is using a pseudonym to protect her identity over concerns about retaliation. Helena says more than one of her relatives died from COVID-19 and she was often stressed about her boss taking the side of maskless shoppers over her team. ""I was like, you know what, this company and the employees here just don't care about anything other than the bottom line,"" she said. But things came to a head after Helena took a moment to check her phone at work, looking for updates on a relative who had just had a stroke. ""My manager went on the walkie-talkie for everyone to hear, saying, 'Do me a favor and put your phone in your locker,'"" Helena said. ""This was right after the mass shooting where the employees couldn't even call home because they were made to put their phones in their lockers."" During the April shooting at a FedEx hub in Indianapolis, workers trapped inside the facility were unable to call or text loved ones because of the shipping giant's policy against cellphones at work. The next day, the manager sent a long text out to the store workers about staying off their phones while on the job. ""This company furloughed us at the beginning of the pandemic,"" Helena said, thinking to herself: ""Why are you working so hard for them? They pay you $10 an hour and you have to do way more work. They don't care about you."" Helena had always given two weeks' notice before leaving a job, so she wrote a resignation letter and went to work her next shift. At closing, she found herself getting yelled at by her manager once more, as she tried to deliver her two weeks' notice. ""I was just so done with that job,"" she said. She decided to just not show up the following day. ""When they texted me to ask me where I was, I told them I was revoking my two weeks' notice,"" she told Insider. ""It felt so good to know that I would never have to work there again."" Gypsy Noonan, another United for Respect member, thought about quitting Walmart many times. She was often assigned as the sole cashier in the store, a task that she found incredibly stressful. Noonan says work-related stress ended up causing her seizures. But she ultimately managed to hold off until she was offered a new opportunity. She gave her two weeks' notice but then found herself assigned to work the cash registers alone, once more. She requested backup from her team lead and from other coworkers. Everyone refused. ""At this point, it's like a light bulb went off and I was like: 'I'm not doing this. I don't have to do this. I refuse to let myself be abused by the system,'"" she said. ""And I walked out the next day."" Some experts say the spate of rage-quitting could signal a sea change for hourly workers. Quincy Valencia, the vice president of product innovation at the hiring platform Hourly by AMS, began her career in big-box-retail management, where she said ""you enjoyed your workers, and the best ones you wanted to keep, but if someone quit, it was not a big deal — there were 10 people waiting to take that job."" Now, Valencia said that attitude ""boggles"" her mind. ""A bad experience with the cashier is going to ensure that a customer doesn't come back,"" she said. ""Nobody cares who your financial analyst is. And yet these industries have always taken more time and more care in trying to hire the right people into those [corporate] roles than in hiring the people who are upfront."" She said that there's a ""twisted mentality"" around hiring hourly workers, in particular. Namely, jobs like working as a cook at a fast-food joint or a clerk in a grocery store are seen as a ""rite of passage"" for high schoolers, a frequently touted myth. ""Even now, the debate is going on about how these workers shouldn't make $15 an hour, because these should be for high-school students,"" she said. ""I would counter that this is sort of off-topic. So what, you can abuse them because they're not raising a family?"" Valencia said this attitude ""cannot"" continue to pervade the talent-acquisition community. ""This category of worker — particularly in retail — has driven our economy over the past, especially here through this pandemic,"" she said. ""And now there's a big mismatch right now between job availability and applicants for those jobs."" But still, that doesn't mean that going through with rage-quitting will empower workers on an individual basis. Laurie Ruettimann, a human-resources expert with a focus on fixing work, told Insider she was concerned about the long-term implications for rage-quitters forced to find a new job on the fly. ""Why would you give up your known crappy job for an unknown, potentially crappy job?"" she told Insider. ""There is this tendency — especially when we've been sheltering in place for so long — like, 'I've just got to get the hell out of here.' But that instinct to just flee is always the wrong instinct."" Ruettimann said employees considering rage-quitting on the spot should try to give themselves ""permission to take this process slowly"" and to focus on gathering information on truly promising new opportunities before resorting to drastic measures. For her part, Kendra, the former Dollar General worker, says she doesn't feel good about quitting out of anger. For now, she is enjoying spending more time with her husband, whom she says she rarely used to see because of all the night shifts she worked. She also says there was no reason for her to continue subjecting herself to a high-stress environment for so little pay. ""I feel bad about it,"" she said. ""But in this country, everyone's making money except for the ones actually doing the work."" Kendra tries to avoid driving by her old Dollar General. The sight of the distinctive black-and-yellow sign makes her sad, thinking about all the workers ""just trying to survive.""",2021-06-05 07:08:00,Workers are 'rage quitting' their jobs as a tightening labor market forces employers to take note of unfavorable conditions and low pay,"medicine and health,labor",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

551,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/06/05/california-judge-assault-weapons-ban-unconstitutional/1321622893890/,"June 5 (UPI) -- A federal judge has struck down California's ban on assault weapons, saying it violates the Second Amendment rights of the state's law-abiding citizens. Judge Roger Benitez compared the AR-15 rifle to a Swiss Army knife in his ruling Friday, citing Supreme Court precedent that protects Second Amendment rights.
Advertisement ""Like the Swiss Army knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment,"" Benitez said in his ruling. ""Good for both home and battle, the AR-15 is the kind of versatile gun that lies at the intersection of the kinds of firearms protected,"" he added, citing Supreme Court cases the District of Columbia vs. Heller and the United States vs. Miller. ""Yet, the State of California makes it a crime to have an AR-15 type rifle. Therefore, this court declares the California statutes to be unconstitutional.""
RELATED Man killed in shooting near San Jose rail yard where 9 died last week Benitez acknowledged that the Supreme Court cautioned in Heller that the Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to keep and carry ""any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" But he referred to ""assault weapons"" as ""fairly ordinary, popular, modern rifles.""
Advertisement The AR-15 has been involved in 11 mass shootings, according to a USA Today Fact Check. These include a shooting at Boulder, Colo., grocery in March that killed 10 people, a December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 children and six educators, and a July 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting that killed 12 people. The AR-15 was also among other weapons used in a October 2017 Las Vegas shooting that killed 61 people. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta argued that the AR-15 should be banned under state law because its features are characteristic of military weapons, which are designated to be accurate with rapid firing that is not needed for self-defense.
RELATED Officials release police body camera video of San Jose shooting attack However, Benitez found that just because the design features were similar to a military rifle that did not take way its ""constitutional protection for self-defense."" ""As the same time, it actually enhances a firearms constitutional protection for militia readiness,"" Benitez said in the ruling. In 2019, Benitez also struck down a pending California law that banned high-capacity machine guns.

RELATED Firefighter killed, another injured in shooting at LA fire station Bonta plans to appeal the latest ruling. ""Today's decision is fundamentally flawed, and we will be appealing it,"" Bonta said in a statement. ""There is no sound basis in law, fact, or common sense for equating assault rifles with swiss army knives -- especially on Gun Violence Awareness Day and after the recent shootings in our own California communities. We need to take action to end gun violence now. We will fight this ruling and continue to advocate for and defend common sense gun laws that will save lives. ""The decision is stayed for 30 days, and the California laws that are subject of the ruling currently remain in full force and effect,"" Bonta added. The death toll from the May 26 mass shooting, including the gunman, in San Jose, Calif., rose to 10 the next day, after one of the injured died in the hospital overnight, according to the medical examiner's office. FBI San Francisco special agent in charge Craig Fair told CNN the handguns used in the Northern California shooting were legally obtained and registered. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who questioned what was wrong with the United States in regards to the frequency of mass shootings in a press conference after the San Jose shooting, also objected to the judge's ruling on assault weapons ban Friday.
Advertisement ""Today's decision is a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent Californians, period,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""As the son of a judge, I grew up with deep respect for the judicial process and the importance of a judge's ability to make impartial fact-based rulings, but the fact that this judge compared the AR-15 -- a weapon of war that's used on the battlefield -- to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who've lost loved ones to this weapon. We're not backing down from this fight, and we'll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives.""",2021-06-05 12:13:57,Federal judge strikes down California's assault weapons ban,"politics and government,law and legislation,gun control,decisions and verdicts,firearms",1706,http://www.upi.com/
552,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/inside-reviewed-bo-burnhams-virtuosic-portrait-of-a-mediated-mind,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Rachel Syme There is an emerging genre of hyperactive art born of the minds of people who have been online since before they hit puberty—call them Dispatches from a Mediated Mind. These are works (whether in writing or performance) that explore what it means to live with a brain broken into shards by a steady stream of social media and open tabs and reality television. Peppered with Reddit slang and obscure pop-culture references, the pieces may not be comprehensible to those who are, say, over sixty, or who are generally well-adjusted enough to have healthy relationships with their phones. But to the rest of us they are both a relief and a terror to encounter, a mirror held up to our own frazzled, fractured consciousness. I’m thinking of “No One Is Talking About This,” the novel by Patricia Lockwood, which dives into the headspace of a woman who is obsessed with logging onto “the portal,” and who has become semi-famous for tweeting, “Can a dog be twins?” Or the zany podcast “POOG,” in which the comedians Kate Berlant and Jacqueline Novak both parody and indulge their own obsession with wellness culture. Or “This American Wife,” a work of “live-stream multi-camera Internet theater,” by the collective Fake Friends, which follows three men who are trapped in a Long Island mansion experiencing a fever dream (slash psychotic break) brought on by watching too many episodes of “The Real Housewives.” These dispatches are not so much about psychological well-being (though mental health, and the precarity of it in a world of relentless stimuli, is a major theme) as they are about the push-pull tension between the self and the media that we produce and consume. We all have multiple personalities now; we are performing constantly. It’s exhausting. It’s exhilarating. It’s making us manic. It’s making us depressed, and never more so than during this past year, when many of us were isolated, our faces pressed up against our laptops like homesick sailors peering through portholes. One of the leading auteurs of the mediated mind, the thirty-year-old comedian Bo Burnham, has a new Netflix special, “Inside,” that captures, with a frenzied and dextrous clarity, the unmoored, wired, euphoric, listless feeling of being very online during the pandemic. The ninety-minute show, which Burnham wrote and directed, is in no way a traditional comedy special, in which a person tells jokes while standing in front of an audience. It contains barely any spoken punch lines at all outside of a few canned, tinny segments, in which the “bits” feel deliberately hackneyed and out-of-date. (Why don’t pirates laminate their treasure maps, eh?) Instead, “Inside” is a virtuosic one-man musical extravaganza, and also an experimental film about cracking up via Wi-Fi connection while trying to make said one-man musical extravaganza—although, in the mediated age, when genres are twisted and mashed together, characterizing it feels almost beyond the point. At its core, “Inside” is an exploration of what it means to be a performer when you are stuck to a screen but also stuck inside your head. Burnham never explicitly mentions the pandemic, a purposeful omission that allows the special’s title to accrue multiple meanings. Technically, yes, “Inside” is a variety show about the isolation of life under quarantine. It is also about Burnham’s very particular interior unease. He craves being seen but resents his gnawing, insatiable need for feedback. (During his last live set, in 2016, he told the crowd, “If you can live your life without an audience, you should do it.”) Burnham leaps among visual and musical references with a swaggering fluency. In one segment, he meticulously recreates the slick, manicured aesthetic of a “white woman’s Instagram.” In another, he jumps into the character of a blasé Twitch streamer testing out a new video game, also called “Inside,” in which he controls a Bo Burnham avatar who can do only a few things: cry, pace, sit. This sight gag underscores the essential claustrophobia of Burnham’s project, and of the past year, in general—but it also evokes the self-punishing aspects of being a performer. Much of the special tries to pinpoint the feeling of living internally and externally in the same instant, and the defensive mentality that it can inspire. “The backlash to the backlash to the thing that’s just begun,” Burnham sings in one number. Burnham is no stranger to sitting alone in a room recording himself. He became famous, as a teen-ager, for the viral YouTube videos that he made in the bedroom of his home, in eastern Massachusetts. Heralded as a comedic wunderkind and a sort of millennial soothsayer, he was living through the comments section from a young age, painfully attuned to what others thought of him and his work. “The reason people give me shit is because I came out of the Internet and I wasn’t getting enough criticism in the clubs,” he said during a roundtable discussion when he was twenty. “But, the truth is, for the older comics who say that, I want them to read ten thousand Internet comments and see if they don’t feel fully criticized.” Burnham had filmed three live specials by the time he was twenty-six, and he found himself torn apart by a decade of churning out “content” (a word that he uses in “Inside” with pointed frequency). As my colleague Michael Schulman reported in a Profile, in 2018, Burnham gave up live performance after suffering regular panic attacks before going on stage. He focussed his efforts instead on behind-the-camera work, directing specials by Chris Rock and Jerrod Carmichael, and making “Eighth Grade,” a film in which he attempted to “take inventory emotionally” of how it feels to be perpetually plugged in at a tender age. (He also turned to acting, appearing in Emerald Fennell’s “Promising Young Woman” as the love interest whose true nature is revealed by a resurfaced bit of old video footage.) In “Inside,” Burnham explains that he had finally gotten his anxiety under control and was planning to get out from behind his laptop and return to the stage sometime in 2020. “I thought, You know what? I should start performing again,” he says. “I’ve been hiding from the world, and I need to reënter. And then . . . the funniest thing happened.” “Inside” unfolds in two acts, with a brief “intermission,” during which Burnham slowly wipes down his camera lens with a squeegee—one of the special’s many meta-references to its own painstaking creation. We also see wires tangled across the floor, shots of Burnham editing the shots we’ve just watched, a montage of him putting on a costume and setting up cardboard backdrops, a scene in which he re-records himself singing because he breathed at the wrong moment, and monologues on the film’s progress that he shoots while staring at his own reflection in the mirror. These glimpses behind the curtain give the work a veneer of authenticity, but Burnham is quick to tell us that we shouldn’t necessarily trust them. About a half hour into the special, he sings a jazzy song about unpaid interns and exploitative labor (one of several short, unhinged riffs about life under late capitalism), then films a “reaction video,” showing himself praising his own performance. He then films a reaction video to that reaction video, and so on, until he is so many layers deep that his reactions cease to ring true at all. As the special goes on, it gets sadder and stranger. Burnham’s hair and beard grow longer, and he looks more and more stranded at sea. Sometime during filming, he turned thirty, and he celebrates by watching a clock tick to midnight and then performing a pop song about existential panic, in his underwear. He frets about finishing work on the special, telling the camera, “That means I have to not work on it anymore, and that means I have to just live my life.” At one point, he starts to cry and knocks over his lighting equipment. Meanwhile, the Web is always there, taunting him. In one of his best numbers, “Welcome to the Internet,” he wears round, carnival barker-esque spectacles and performs in front of a planetarium projection. “Could I interest you in everything all of the time?” he sings. In the early days of the pandemic, there was a lot of chatter on Twitter about the fact that Shakespeare had written “King Lear” during the plague; would isolation give all of us the time to complete our own masterpieces? Then again, wasn’t it hard enough to stay sane during such a fearful, overwhelming time without expecting great things of ourselves? “Inside” is about feeling wayward and alone, but it’s also a record of a pandemic year spent putting extreme, electrifying effort into making something. Burnham constructs tableaus for each shot, using creative lighting techniques born of isolated necessity: a disco ball illuminated with a headlamp flashlight, a phone screen used as a follow spot, a white wall cleverly transformed into a green screen. But my favorite scene is a quieter one toward the end, in which Burnham performs an acoustic song in front of a projection of aspen trees, lit only by candlelight (a nod to TikTok’s “cottagecore” aesthetic, another visual joke). He spouts a list of terms—“ ‘Carpool Karaoke,’ Steve Aoki, Logan Paul / A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall”—that don’t make sense together, except that they do, when you have online brain. “There it is again, that funny feeling,” he croons. At the end of the special, he briefly finds a way out of his room and into the sunshine—but the freedom, too, proves to be a ruse. As we emerge from a long year of solitude, many of us are negotiating a version of the same internal conflict that torments Burnham. Is it scarier to “never go outside again,” as he sings in his final song, or to give up our mediated inside lives for a riskier kind of exposure?

553,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/tyler-o-neil/2021/06/05/newsom-squirms-as-judge-strikes-down-calif-assault-weapons-ban-n1452316,"On Friday night, a federal judge struck down California’s decades-long ban on “assault weapons,” ruling that the ban violates the Second Amendment as understood under the precedents of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and United States v. Miller (1939). “Under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive,” U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez wrote, claiming that the California statutes banning “assault weapons” are “arbitrary and capricious.” He issued a permanent injunction that takes effect in 30 days. Attorney General Rob Bonta (D-Calif.) announced he would appeal the decision. Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed that the ruling “is a direct threat to public safety and innocent Californians.” The governor also cited one of the more colorful parts of the ruling, a comparison between a Swiss Army knife and an AR-15. “Overturning CA’s assault weapon ban and comparing an AR-15 to a SWISS ARMY KNIFE is a disgusting slap in the face to those who have lost loved ones to gun violence,” Newsom tweeted. “This is a direct threat to public safety and innocent Californians. We won’t stand for it.” Overturning CA’s assault weapon ban and comparing an AR-15 to a SWISS ARMY KNIFE is a disgusting slap in the face to those who have lost loved ones to gun violence. This is a direct threat to public safety and innocent Californians. We won’t stand for it. https://t.co/feL5BABTXa — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) June 5, 2021  Recommended: Supreme Court Takes Up First Gun Case in 10 Years Yet Benitez’s comparison is not as outrageous as Newsom suggests. In the ruling, Benitez notes that Californians already own hundreds of thousands of “assault weapons” under the state’s definition, and that the definition in the law is rather arbitrary. These and other points make the Swiss Army knife comparison far more reasonable than it appears at first blush. “Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. Good for both home and battle, the AR-15 is the kind of versatile gun that lies at the intersection of the kinds of firearms protected under District of Columbia v. Heller, (2008) and United States v Miller, (1939). Yet, the State of California makes it a crime to have an AR15 type rifle. Therefore, this Court declares the California statutes to be unconstitutional,” Benitez wrote. The judge noted that the legacy media twists the facts on gun ownership. “One is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous AR-15 assault rifles. The facts, however, do not support this hyperbole, and facts matter,” he wrote. “Federal Bureau of Investigation murder statistics do not track assault rifles, but they do show that killing by knife attack is far more common than murder by any kind of rifle. In California, murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle.” In 2019, for example, assailants murdered 252 people in California with a knife, while criminals murdered only 34 people with some type of rifle. “A Californian is three times more likely to be murdered by an attacker’s bare hands, fists, or feet, than by his rifle,” Benitez noted. The judge noted that California appears to define “assault weapon” in terms of accuracy under fire. Under § 30515(a), a rifle is labeled an “assault weapon” if it is one of three principal types. The first type is a semiautomatic centerfire rifle that does not have a fixed magazine but has one of the following prohibiting features: a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the rifle, a thumbhole stock, a folding or telescoping stock, a grenade or flare launcher, a flash suppressor, or a forward pistol grip. The second type is a semiautomatic centerfire rifle that has a fixed magazine able to hold more than 10 rounds. The third type is a semiautomatic centerfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches. “The mechanical design features that identify a rifle as a California ‘assault weapon,’ it is argued, tend to help a person shoot the rifle more accurately under pressure,” Benitez explained. Recommended: SHOCKING New Study Shows Just How Much the Media Is in the Tank for Gun Control Benitez noted that the plaintiffs in the case — the San Diego County Gun Owners Political Action Committee, California Gun Rights Foundation, Second Amendment Foundation, and the Firearms Policy Coalition — argue that better accuracy “is a better condition for all lawful uses, i.e., a more accurate gun is better for everyone. After all, responsible gun-owners worry about the ending point of every round fired. If shooting in self-defense, a home defender wants every round to hit only attackers.” Benitez noted that Attorney General Bonta argued that better accuracy makes a weapon more dangerous. “According to the Attorney General, ‘assault weapons enable a shooter to fire more rounds rapidly in a given period with greater accuracy, increasing the likelihood that more individuals will be shot and suffer more numerous injuries.’ The implied context is a mass shooting.” Yet even in a mass shooting, more accuracy may not result in fewer victims. “A less accurate rifle in the hands of a mass shooter may very well result in different victims, but not necessarily less victims. On the other hand, in the self-defense context, which seems to be more common, taking accurate shots at attackers is vitally important for the innocent victim. While the state ought to protect its residents against victimization by a mass shooter, it ought also to protect its residents against victimization by home-invading criminals,” the judge argued. Yet Bonta’s court filings do not reflect “a goal of preventing violence perpetrated against law-abiding citizens in their homes.” The judge also noted that “the ‘assault weapon’ epithet is a bit of a misnomer. These prohibited guns, like all guns, are dangerous weapons. However, these prohibited guns, like all guns, can be used for ill or for good. They could just as well be called ‘home defense rifles’ or ‘anti-crime guns.'” The judge noted that California’s “arbitrary and capricious” ban on “assault weapons” appears rather ineffective. “Even in California, despite being banned for 20 to 30 years, according to the State’s own evidence, there are 185,569 ‘assault weapons’ currently registered with the California Department of Justice,” he noted. “According to the State’s evidence, a 2018 California Safety and WellBeing Survey reports 4.2 million adult Californians personally own a firearm. And Californians own an estimated 19.9 million firearms. According to this survey, of the 19.9 million firearms in the state, assault weapons make up 5% or approximately 1,000,000.” Benitez also noted that since the original ban in 1989, California has amended the definition of “assault weapons” multiple times, in an apparent effort to disarm citizens. “Like Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert relentlessly searching for Jean Valjean, California continues to amend its statutes to prohibit more and more firearms,” he wrote. While the Swiss Army knife comparison may seem jarring, it illustrates an important principle. The attorney general appears unable to conceive of “assault weapons” as instruments of home defense, rather than tools in the hands of a mass shooter. Accuracy under pressure does not necessarily make a gun more dangerous — in lawful circumstances, accuracy makes a weapon safer. Not only is the term “assault weapon” a misnomer, but singling out more accurate firearms for a ban may actually make many situations more dangerous. Bonta seems utterly blind to that possibility.

554,https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/05/hoober-compact-pistols-and-the-distance-dilemma-sometimes-the-gun-matters-a-little/,"(Photo by ED JONES/AFP via Getty Images) By Sam Hoober When you pick a gun or other gear, you want to select tools that will help you accomplish the tasks you might have to do with it. Therefore, consider those tasks carefully and therefore the tool you choose. Guns are tools, so make sure you pick one that’s capable of what you mean to do with it. It’s no secret that people who conceal and carry a gun tend to prefer compact, subcompact and micro size pistols for daily carry. I mean, DUH, why do you want to make things harder on yourself. The EDC pistols du jour are the Sig P365 and the Springfield Armory Hellcat, though Smith and Wesson has thrown its hat in the ring with the Shield Plus and of course Ruger is now making the Max 9, essentially a double-stack LC9 with a bit of the Security 9 thrown in. These differ from previous double-stack subcompacts, in that all use a half-staggered magazine to reduce width but still retain some capacity. Previous double-stack subbie autos have been short, fat and notoriously hard to shoot well. We’re looking at you Glock 26! The modern guns are great, but let’s throw a little cold water on here. You see, one of the specific threats to the average Joe or Jane in the modern era is the “active shooter” or “mass shooter.” Granted, the risks are low; you literally have higher chances of winning the Powerball or being struck by lightning than being anywhere near one. However, it is a known phenomenon and contrary to what CNN tells you, it is actually global in nature. Gun violence doesn’t only happen in the United States. So, why does this matter in regard to handguns? When you read reports of a mass shooter being successfully engaged by an armed citizen or by  a police officer, what is fairly common is having to take a long-distance shot with a handgun or at least longer than typical pistol-shooting range. For instance, the Fairchild Air Force Base shooting in 1994 was resolved when MP Andy Brown fired his sidearm – A Beretta M9 – at the shooter, hitting him with two out of four shots from 80 yards. A 2012 shooting incident that resulted in two killed at the Peach House RV Park in Early, Texas was concluded when the shooter took fire from resident Vic Stacy. Stacy fired from about 100 yards away with a Colt Python. A 2014 mass shooting in Austin, Texas was stopped when a Mounted Patrol officer made a 100-yard shot – one-handed – with his service pistol, presumably a Glock 22 and hit the perpetrator center-chest. In all examples, the suspect was armed with a rifle. And herein lies the rub: if you carry a gun for your own defense, this is a scenario you may have to be prepared to deal with. You may be the only person with a gun, and you might be the next person in their sights if you happen to be somewhere a mass shooting occurs. If you’re concerned with the possibility of a mass shooter, one of the things you have to be aware of is that you might have to make that 50-yard, 80-yard or even 100-yard shot. What does this mean in terms of equipment? Well, the shorter the sight radius, the more difficult it is to place accurate shots at longer distance. Elmer Keith might have made a 600-yard shot on a deer, but he was doing it with a Model 29 and had to walk the shot onto the buck. Combat-style sights also don’t allow for the greatest amount of precision. In other words, subcompact and micro pistols are going to be very hard to use well in this scenario. A gun with a 4-inch or longer barrel is going to be a bit easier. Is this to say that only a service-size gun is fit to carry? No. Is this to say that you can’t practice up and learn to hit with a S&W Shield or Sig P365 at 50 yards or more? Of course not. This is more to say that you want to really think about what your role as an armed citizen is all about. You might decide that you’re going to be running for the exits if a mass shooting starts wherever you’re located. You might also decide you want to be able to confront any threat, but that you have to be completely out of options before you do. That all is up to you. From there, you choose the gun, holster, accessories and set your training priorities. Mindset and ability have a lot more to do with self-defense than equipment; all equipment does is make certain things easier or harder. You want to set yourself up for success in whatever you do, so these are good things to think about. Sam Hoober is a hunter and shooter based in the Inland Northwest.

558,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/site-miami-mass-shooting-declared-unsafe-structure-county-officials-n1269745," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Miami-Dade County officials declared the El Mula Banquet Hall, the site of a recent mass shooting that left three people dead and 20 others injured, as an unsafe structure following a building inspection. Inspectors found evidence of electrical work that was done without appropriate permits as well as violations of the facility’s certificate of use to operate as a banquet hall. They also reported that plumbing materials and a partition wall had been installed without permits. Tere Florin, a spokeswoman for the county’s Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources, said the building's power was cut off Friday as a result of the violations and will remain shut off until further notice, NBC Miami reported. Officials shut off electricity at the banquet hall one day after a third person died as a result of her injuries following Sunday's shooting. Shaniqua Peterson, 32, had been in a coma with a bullet lodged in her brain before she passed away Thursday. She is survived by her 12-year-old son, according to her family. Two men, Desmond Owens and Clayton Dillard III, both 26, were killed during the shooting Sunday. Florin told the Miami Herald that agency officials ""don’t believe there’s any relationship between the shooting itself and the work that we’re doing” as a result of the building violations. However, the inspection was prompted by the shooting after Miami-Dade police asked county code compliance officials to inspect the site. On Sunday morning, three people got out of an SUV and ""began shooting indiscriminately into the crowd"" outside a ""scheduled event"" taking place at the establishment located on 186th Street, in the Hialeah area west of Miami Gardens. Security video released by authorities Monday shows three people, who appear to be carrying guns, getting out of a white SUV and walking out of the frame. The people can be seen running back to the vehicle shortly afterward before driving away. “They took a mother from her son. They took a daughter from her parents. They took a sister from her siblings. They took a niece from her aunts and uncles,” Peterson's family said in a statement to NBC Miami. “Words can’t express the deep pain my family and I are feeling. If you know something, say something!” Authorities are offering a $30,000 reward for information leading to the shooters' arrests, with an additional $100,000 for their convictions. The $100,000 was donated by businessman and TV personality Marcus Lemonis, who has a reality show on CNBC. Sunday's shooting at El Mula Banquet Hall was one of multiple incidents during a deadly Memorial Day weekend in South Florida. One person died after seven people were shot last Friday night, NBC Miami reported. A homeowner shot a 10-year-old whose father had driven him to participate in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun on Sunday, Opa-locka police said. The homeowner confused the paintball for real gunfire, telling police he thought his family was being attacked. He fired one shot, which struck the child. And on Monday evening, a shooting that erupted outside a Miami Beach restaurant left two people injured. Wisdom Awute, 21, and Christopher Urena, 29, were arrested shortly after the shooting, Miami Beach police said Tuesday. Awute, a rapper known as Wisdom, was part of rapper DaBaby's entourage, according to an arrest report. DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, was interviewed and released by police and was not charged, according to police and his attorney. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has launched ""new efforts to step up enforcement and protection,"" she said in a statement Friday. Some of these efforts include the deployment of joint police and code enforcement special units ""to expand monitoring and enforcement of potential illegal activity in commercial locations that foster environments of lawlessness and violence.""
