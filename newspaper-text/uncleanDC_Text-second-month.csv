(Photo courtesy of Camden County Police Department) There are guns in South Jersey firing bullets that can slice through a police officer’s body armor, or the walls of several homes before stopping. It’s illegal to have them in  New Jersey, but you don’t have to travel far to buy one. And law enforcement officials know the Garden State’s ban isn’t going to stop a criminal — already intent on breaking plenty of other laws — from bringing one across state lines. That's partly why assault weapons — known for their devastating potential — show up enough in South Jersey police reports to warrant concern. That concern was renewed when authorities at first indicated such guns may have been used in the two latest Jersey-connected active shooter incidents — the killing of one and wounding of three at Los Angeles International Airport on Nov. 1 and the Paramus Mall incident Nov. 4 that ended in an apparent suicide. It turns out the guns allegedly used by 23-year-old Paul Ciancia and 20-year-old Richard Shoop were modifications that looked like assault rifles, authorities in both cases said.  But the real thing is never far away, as South Jersey statistics show. New Jersey law prohibits  possession of assault weapons by anyone except law enforcement or military personnel. A judge may also make exceptions for others under strict circumstances. State law defines an assault weapon as a semi-automatic handgun or rifle with a detachable ammunition magazine or “clip,” along with any two of the following: a folding or telescopic stock, a protruding pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor or mount, or a grenade launcher. A gun is semi-automatic when it is loaded with a magazine containing several rounds, and the user can fire a round with each squeeze of the trigger.  After each round is fired, another is automatically loaded into the chamber. A gun is automatic when the user can fire multiple rounds by holding in the trigger. Semi-automatic weapons, whether handguns or rifles, were used in the 2007 Virginia Tech incident, in the December 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and in the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, as well as many other mass shooting incidents that have plagued the nation in recent years. A mix of weapons were used, including assault rifles. Such rifles are no stranger to Camden which, according to the FBI, was the nation's most dangerous city with a record 67 homicides in 2012. There, said Camden County Police Chief J. Scott Thomson, “assault rifles account for 3 percent of our violent gun crime incidents, which is consistent with other urban centers in the region. “However, we have been seeing an increase in the use of military-grade rifles among disputing drug gangs over the past year,” he said. Thomson pointed out an assault rifle’s ability to fire bullets through multiple walls or body armor. He added that “a bullet fired from one of these rifles has the potential to penetrate a three-quarter-inch-thick steel plate at close range.” Such guns also have magazines that can hold up to 30 bullets, “with each bullet having the energy to travel up to one mile with devastating capabilities. “The most prevalent assault rifle we see is the AK-47, which fires a 7.62 round,” Thomson continued. “To a lesser degree, we see crime scenes with .223 shell casings, which is indicative of an AR-15 (rifle), the civilian equivalent to the military’s M-16.” The AR-15 is very popular among gun enthusiasts. But it has also been a weapon of choice for several recent mass shooters. Adam Lanza carried a Bushmaster AR-15, aside from several handguns, when he entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. James Holmes also brought a variation of the AR-15 into the Aurora, Colo., movie theater in which he killed 12 people in July 2012. It was initially alleged that Ciancia used such a rifle at LAX. In Camden, whatever the type, authorities have seized seven assault rifles over the past 12 months, up from four during the previous period, Thomson said. Thomson added that his department has been “working feverishly with the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) to stem the illegal flow of this type of devastating weapon into our city.” He pointed out that many assault rifle varieties can be bought at gun shows as close as Pennsylvania or Delaware. In Gloucester County, the number of arrests involving assault weapons has varied over the past few years. Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office (GCPO) records show seven charges of violating the state’s assault weapons law in 2011, according to GCPO spokesman Bernie Weisenfeld. Three of those charges involved the same defendant, Weisenfeld added. The following year saw no such violations, but there have been two so far in 2013. It was unclear whether the most recent number included the Nov. 2 arrest of a Washington Township man accused of brandishing an AR-15 outside a township home. --- Contact staff writer Joe Green at 856-845-3300 ext. 253 or jgreen@southjerseymedia.com Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

That's because in New Jersey, a gun owner can only transport the gun for extremely limited purposes, such as taking it from his or her home to a licensed shooting range. Deviation on that trip is illegal. So the munchies are a problem. ""If you want to go stop for a bagel, you're breaking the law,"" said  Peter Miscia of the newly renovated RTSP range in Randolph. That's why when RTSP held is grand re-opening this weekend, visitors found among the enhancements a self-serve cafe. It's a place where a gun owner — or any other visitor — can grab a bite without disrupting his or her day out at the range. It's one of the smaller touches to a massive expansion that took the 10,000 square foot gun shop and range — which was the first indoor shooting range in New Jersey to open in several years when it came onto the scene two years ago — to 35,000 square feet. The facility now includes training rooms and a dojo for martial arts lessons. A digital shooting simulator projects bad guys (abusive husbands, bank robbers ... even zombies) up onto a wall, where users can practice their shooting skills with real bullets, against (sometimes) realistic assailants without real bullets. • Follow us on Twitter • Like us on Facebook • NJ.com/morris A ""shoot house"" simulates a home or a school, providing a training ground RTSP hopes will prove useful for law enforcement — as real schools and community facilities aren't always eager to have people running around with guns, even off hours. Role-players and participants use paint-based ammunition — think paintball, but with a much more severe impact. A VIP room with a hefty admittance fee offers a place where VIP Club members (the fee to reserve a spot is a hefty $2,000) can relax in luxury, with signed sporting memorabilia, fanacy furniture, a non-alcoholic wet bar and a pool table on hand. And the range itself has been expanded from nine ports to 21, with a new room offering a more high-tech setup complete with remote-controlled robots bringing targets back and forth. Miscia said he and his partners, Rick Friedman and Brad Tremarol, originally planned to expand RTSP after about four years, if conditions seemed right. But they said they saw such strong interest from law enforcement and civilians over the last two years, they stepped up their timetable. Miscia, a former Montclair police officer, said he was worried after last year's school mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. — when talk of stricter state and federal gun regulation was in the air — that new restrictions could hurt RTSP's business. ""What we do is a gamble,"" he said. ""One piece of legislation could shut us down."" But he said he and his partners were confident they could offer something to the general population and to police they won't find elsewhere in the area. ""We think there's a real place for this,"" he said. Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.

X OUR PICKS: WASHINGTON—It was reasonable for officials to reroute a Capitol Police tactical squad away from the Washington Navy Yard rampage amid concerns about possible threats to the U.S. Capitol after the officers got stuck in traffic, according to a report released Friday that defends the decision. The officers in the specially trained unit, which handles crises such as mass shootings, tried to respond to the Navy Yard but could not even reach the command post there because of traffic snarls caused by emergency vehicles, according to the two-page document. There were also no demands for additional Capitol Police resources beyond the teams that were already there and commanders were faced with “the potential of threats or secondary attacks” to the Capitol building, the report states. The unit was directed to the Capitol more than a half-hour after the first reports of the attack. “Everyone’s intentions were the right intentions ’cause they’re the type of people who want to go,” Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said in an interview. “That’s what they want to do. We respect that and appreciate that.” Dine called for a review into the response to the Sept. 16 shooting amid reports that a Capitol Police supervisor had directed the Containment and Emergency Response Team to stand down and not respond to the rampage. The Capitol Police Board, which oversees the agency, initiated the investigation at Dine’s request and released a summary of a review team’s findings on Friday. Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer, who serves on the board, said at the time the investigation was announced that the reports, if true, would represent an “unbearable failure.” But he said Friday that the reality uncovered by a special review team was far more nuanced, and that the decision to recall the four-member unit made sense in light of the overall circumstances. “It was reasonable to have them come back,” he said. Gainer, a former Capitol Police chief, said while he understood the inclination to second-guess the decision he did not think it was appropriate to speculate whether the unit would have made a difference if allowed inside the building. Tactical officers from multiple other law enforcement agencies also responded to the rampage and the gunman was killed during a police shootout. “These are very fluid, fast-moving events and they’re sort of multilayered,” Dine said. The Capitol Police is responsible for protecting congressional buildings as well as members of Congress and their families. But its units sometimes respond to emergencies away from the Capitol complex. On the day of the shooting, two motorcycle units deployed to the Navy Yard to help with traffic control, along with another team that helped protect the perimeter and a sergeant who served as a command post liaison, according to the report. The gunman, Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old former Navy reservist and government contractor who worked at the Navy Yard, killed 12 people before being shot to death by police. The FBI has said he was experiencing delusions in the months leading up to the shooting, leaving behind writings indicating that he believed he was being bombarded by extremely low frequency radio waves. The review team conducted dozens of interviews and evaluated radio transmissions and command center incident logs. Several other recommendations were made as part of the investigation, including improving communication between different Capitol Police units during an emergency. The full report was not publicly released. Dine said in an email to the department that the report “will truly help our Department moving forward.” ———— Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://twitter.com/etuckerAP Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

The Hartford (Conn.) Courant reported Saturday that it has obtained new details about the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., from police sources. The newspaper said a state police report on the tragedy is expected to be released soon. 
Advertisement Adam Lanza, 20, who had attended Sandy Hook as a child, first shot his mother, Nancy, and then drove to the school where he gunned down 20 students and six members of the staff. He killed himself as police closed in. In one classroom, Lanza's gun jammed, the Courant said. Students told investigators that Jesse Lewis, 6, called to other children to run, and six escaped. Sources also described what they found when the Lanza home was searched. Nancy Lanza was apparently shot at close range as she lay in bed. Investigators found that her son's room was neat with the bed made. The windows were covered with black plastic trash bags fastened down with duct tape. They also discovered Lanza had removed the hard drives from his computers in the room next door and hid them with a barbell in an effort to render them unreadable. Investigators said Lanza's car was parked at the school in a way that suggested he was planning to ambush police when they arrived.",2013-10-20 21:39:15,"Report: Boy, 6, killed at Sandy Hook school told others to run",,1706,http://www.upi.com/

""Small scale demo activity has begun and will accelerate over the next days,"" First Selectwoman Patricia Llodra told television station WVIT, West Hartford, Conn.
Advertisement ""The process of demolition is incremental, staged precisely and executed carefully,"" she said. ""There is no wrecking-ball action. It is rather a piece-by-piece, section-by-section removal."" The work site is shielded from public view to prevent anyone from taking photos or videos. Contractors taking down the school where 20 schoolchildren and six adult staff members were killed Dec. 14 have signed confidentiality agreements, WVIT said. The massacre was the second deadliest mass shooting by a single person in U.S. history, after the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, which left 32 people dead. The Sandy Hook shooting prompted renewed debate about gun control in the United States and led to stricter gun laws in Connecticut, New York and other nearby states. All parts of the elementary school, as well as the playground, driveway and sidewalks, will be pulverized or melted down so pieces of the tragedy can't be taken as souvenirs or sold to bidders on eBay, Llodra said last week. The 28-member Sandy Hook School Task Force voted unanimously May 15 to demolish the school and build a new one on the same spot. Town voters voted overwhelmingly Oct. 5 to fund the project with a $49 million state grant. The entrance to the new school, scheduled to open by December 2016, will be relocated so people won't have to walk in front of a firehouse where anguished parents waited hours before learning their children were dead, the Los Angeles Times said. While most residents say they want the school removed, a parent whose son was a first-grader at Sandy Hook when the mass shooting erupted said he considered the demolition a final surrender to the 20-year-old shooter, whose name is rarely said out loud in Newtown. ""The hardest thing I'm having to deal with is ... the feeling that we didn't just lose 20 children and six adults,"" Peter Barresi told the Times. ""We're letting him take the building too, and he's winning.""

The family of a woman killed during a mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in September is seeking $37.5 million from the Navy and the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that red flags about the deteriorating mental health of the killer were ignored.

The claim, which is the first step toward filing a lawsuit, has been delivered to the agencies. Aaron Alexis gunned down 12 people at the Navy Yard on Sept. 16 before being killed in a shootout with police. At issue is whether the company that employed Alexis knew he was having mental health problems and whether the federal agencies were aware of his troubles.

Every Monday Sandy Hook Promise, based in Newtown, Conn., has announced a new campaign called Parent Together – designed to empower parents and local communities to address causes of gun violence. Loading... November 15, 2013 As the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School approaches, new channels are emerging for people to mark it in constructive ways. Lessons for schoolkids, grass-roots actions to prevent violence, local acts of service, and vigils for gun-violence victims are just some of the ways people will be reflecting on that devastating event. The group Sandy Hook Promise, based in Newtown, Conn., announced Thursday a new grassroots campaign called Parent Together – designed to empower parents and local communities to address causes of gun violence such as mental-health issues and social connectedness for young people. “Unfortunately, all of the debate keeps focusing on just the guns – it’s always about gun control or gun freedoms, and it’s become a very polarized and political debate, rather than a conversation,” says Nicole Hockley, who lost her son Dylan in the shooting and is one of the Sandy Hook Promise organizers. In hundreds of conversations with parents and people on both sides of the gun debate around the country, Ms. Hockley says, the message that came back about preventing gun violence was largely, “We don’t want legislation to tell us what to do, we want to be given the tools to be able to do it ourselves in our own communities.” It’s not that her group hasn’t supported certain gun-control laws and lobbied to improve mental-health treatment, but the Parent Together campaign will begin rolling out tools early next year to spread models that have been effective in some communities – on everything from how to have a conversation with your child about gun safety to ways that pediatricians can detect and address mental-health challenges earlier, Hockley says. So far, nearly 260,000 people have signed on to the website’s “promise” to have open conversations about reducing violence, and the hope is to reach 500,000 by Dec. 14 and continue to grow from there, Hockley says. Like campaigns to reduce drunk driving or increase recycling, she says, the conversations can grow organically into action. For Hockley, it’s very personal work. She wants to spare as many parents as possible what she’s been through. “It’s also my way of helping keep Dylan alive in many respects, because this is a legacy that I want to give him,” she says. “He was 6 when he died, so I’ll never know what sort of person he could have been. But if his name and his beautiful face can be associated with some sort of movement and positive change that helps save the lives of others, that’s what keeps me going.” Children also have a way to lend their voices to the conversation through a new anti-violence lesson plan. Back in January, when Sandy Hook students returned to class in a neighboring building, they were greeted with painted handprints from Connecticut children showing solidarity. Now, cut-out handprints are at the center of the “Hand of Hope for Sandy Hook” lesson plans. They were developed jointly by Hockley, former US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and award-winning teacher Jessica Lura from Los Altos, Calif. Available on the website UClass.org, the lessons are designed to help students in grades 4 through 12 discuss the Sandy Hook tragedy and how people have tried to make schools safer in its wake. They culminate in students writing on their cut-out hands two statements – one starting with “I hope” and expressing how they want the country to be safer, and another stating one thing they will do to make the country better for everyone. Students will upload photographs of their “hands of hope” to the website, and organizers want to receive at least 1,000 submissions before the anniversary to compile a digital collage. “Stopping gun violence takes courage and new ideas,” said a statement about the project by Ms. Giffords on the website of Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization that she founded with her husband to reduce gun violence after she survived a 2011 shooting. “We are proud to bring students together to honor the lives lost in the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, and encourage them to envision an America that is both free and safe.” Another group, the Newtown Action Alliance, which focuses on gun-control laws, is organizing a national vigil in Washington on Dec. 12 to remember approximately 30,000 people killed in gun violence each year in the US.

For their part, Newtown leaders have said there will not be a town-wide event to mark the anniversary. “Our community is choosing to remember and honor those who lost their lives in that awful tragedy in ways that are quiet, personal, and respectful – centered on the themes of kindness, love, and service to others,” wrote Newtown First Selectman Pat Llodra in a statement joined by local schools, churches, and civic groups. “In Newtown, we are encouraging every resident, young and old, to use the weeks leading up to this anniversary as a time to formally commit to acts of service and kindness…. [T]here is no greater gift of love than to act on behalf of those whose lives were taken.” Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.

X OUR PICKS: TAMPA, Fla.—The family of a woman slain during the mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard is seeking $37.5 million from the government, saying the Navy and Department of Veterans Affairs ignored red flags about the killer’s deteriorating mental health. During a news conference Friday in Tampa, attorneys for the family of Mary DeLorenzo Knight said they were seeking the money in an administrative claim. The claim, one of the first steps toward filing a lawsuit, has been delivered to the agencies. Under federal law, the Navy and VA must investigate the claim and determine whether it has merit. If they think it doesn’t, attorneys for Knight’s family said they will sue. A VA spokesman said he could not comment. Navy spokeswoman Courtney L. Hillson said the Navy is working closely with the Department of Justice on the claim but she could not comment further because the investigation is ongoing. Knight was one of 12 people gunned down by Aaron Alexis on Sept. 16 before he was killed in a shootout with police. The lawsuit said the contractor Alexis worked for should have told the Navy about his mental health problems and that the Navy should not have given him security clearance. Navy officials have said they found no record the company alerted the Navy about his mental health. Knight, a 51-year-old divorced mother of two adult daughters, was born into a military family and worked as an expert in cybersecurity at the Navy Yard. “My sister would want me to fight for her and fight for the girls,” said Patricia DeLorenzo, Knight’s younger sister. DeLorenzo wanted to know why a man with a mental illness was allowed into the Navy Yard with a gun. The FBI has said Alexis entered the Navy Yard in a vehicle and parked in a deck across from Building 197. He went into the building carrying a bag and came out of a fourth-floor bathroom with a shotgun. “We can stop crazy guys with guns from coming on our property,” Knight family attorney Sidney Matthew said. “Since 9-11, there is no excuse for any governmental agency not to pass along information that there are dangerous crazy guys out there.” Alexis was employed by the Fort Lauderdale-based company The Experts. The company declined comment on the claim. The Navy has ordered an in-depth investigation into the shooting and the events that led up to it, including a detailed look at the shooter, his mental health background and whether any adverse information was ever reported to the service about him. According to the lawsuit, Alexis was delusional and believed “he was being controlled or influenced by low-frequency electromagnetic waves.” The lawsuit said the VA failed to treat his mental illness when Alexis went to a VA emergency room Aug. 23 for insomnia and detailed three arrests involving Alexis and his post-traumatic stress disorder, anger management problems and alcohol abuse. The VA has said Alexis visited hospitals in Washington and Rhode Island in the weeks before the rampage but denied that he was depressed or having thoughts of harming himself or others. The VA has also said he was evaluated for mental health problems that might have contributed to his insomnia, but records don’t reveal a history of mental health disorders. ——— Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts As you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

Open Carry Texas @OpenCarryTexas Poor @MomsDemand having to lie to its members and the public to push their agenda. Sad. So sad.  Four members of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America gathered for a membership meeting today at Blue Mesa Grill restaurant. We were confronted soon after by gun advocates who found out about our meeting on Facebook - they disagree with our goal of changing America's gun laws and policies to protect our children and families. Nearly 40 armed men, women and children held a protest in the parking lot - many of them armed with semi-automatic rifles. Our mom members and restaurant customers were terrified by what appeared to be an armed ambush. Sadly, these bullies are attempting to use guns to intimidate moms and children and to infringe on our constitutional right to free speech. But Moms Demand Action will not be deterred.

Sybrina Fulton, mother of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, speaks with her attorney at Tuesday's Senate hearing on Stand Your Ground laws.Jay Mallin/ZUMA Wire  When it was his turn to ask a question at Tuesday’s Senate hearing on Stand Your Ground laws, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) lowered his voice and spoke cautiously about the pain Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, must feel. But then he got to his point. Addressing Fulton, who had traveled from Florida to express her opposition to the spread of these laws, Cruz sought to downplay the significance of her message. “I understand, for the family, you’re simply mourning the loss of your son, and I understand that,” he said, “but there are other players that are seeking to do a great deal more based on what happened that Florida night.” Cruz, his Republican colleagues, and the witnesses they’d summoned before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights, had a different point to make: Stand Your Ground laws—which allow a person to kill another if he feels his life is endangered—benefit black people if you hold the data up to the light and squint a little. And those who would say otherwise are using race as a cudgel to force through their anti-gun agenda. “With whom do we stand?” Cruz asked. “I for one believe we should stand for the innocent against aggressors.” Cruz, who threatened a filibuster to block gun control legislation in the Senate last spring, argued that Stand Your Ground laws actually help black people, because black defendants are more likely to have a killing ruled justifiable by a jury. (Black defendants who cited SYG were successful 55 percent of the time, according to Cruz’s statistics; white defendants who made the same claim were successful in 53 percent of the cases.) Fulton and Lucia McBath, another witness whose son, Jordan Davis, was shot by a man who is expected to claim the Stand Your Ground defense, had plenty of evidence to the contrary, but Cruz and his allies talked right past them. John Lott, a pro-gun researcher who has chided President Barack Obama in the pages of National Review for failing to speak out against black-on-white violence, offered more data to support Cruz’s theory that blacks gain from SYG laws. “If you’re going to concentrate on the fact that relatively few people who kill blacks are going to be convicted, you have to realize that most of those people who aren’t being convicted are blacks,” he said. “Ninety percent of blacks who were killed in cases where Stand Your Ground was invoked as a defense were killed by other blacks.” Lott was suggesting that the limited data available could be read to suggest that African Americans were benefiting from SYG laws. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), who was appearing as a witness, started off his prepared remarks by informing the room that he had once defended a black man who was being tried for murdering “an unarmed naked man.” But he didn’t present any statistics to back up Cruz’s argument. Democratic lawmakers and witnesses, however, cited studies from Texas A&M University and the National Urban League that highlighted the stark racial disparities in Stand Your Ground laws and picked up on what Cruz missed: The greatest determining factor in whether your SYG claim will hold up is the race of the victim. According to a study commissioned by the National Urban League, homicides were “justifiable” in 49 percent of cases in which a white man shot a black man compared to just 8 percent of cases in which the roles were reversed. Other studies have found similar results. Here’s a chart that John Roman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, created using data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation: Tuesday’s hearing was originally supposed to be held on September 17, but was postponed because of the mass shooting at Washington Navy Yard. A hearing on gun laws, bumped because of a mass-murderer with a gun. That’s not a metaphor, just a thing that happened.

34,http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_24442078/accused-lax-shooters-new-jersey-hometown-site-serial?source=rss,"Trending: For the second time in 20 years, the tight-knit community of Pennsville Township, N.J., has made the map for murder. On Friday, Paul Anthony Ciancia, a former resident who is the son of a predominant local businessman, was accused of carrying out a deadly mass shooting at Los Angels International Airport. In 1997, infamous serial killer Andrew Cunanan murdered a cemetery worker in Pennsville before moving on to Miami, where he eventually ended the life of acclaimed clothing design Gianni Versace. The killings in 1997 and on Friday morning brought the media spotlight to this riverside town in southwest New Jersey, about 10 miles from Wilmington, Del.   Townsfolk were hesitant to talk about the Ciancia family, or the eldest son accused of killing a Transportation Safety Administration worker inside Terminal 3 at LAX. Ciancia, 23, is reportedly in critical condition at a local hospital, recovering from gunshot wounds fired by airport police. In New Jersey, the Ciancia family remained sequestered inside their large home just outside town. A Pennsville police officer sat at the edge of their long driveway, preventing the media from making contact. The son left this small town more than a year ago and hasn’t been back, the officer said.   A nearby resident mowing his lawn said he was upset by the recent events allegedly involving his neighbor’s son. “Paul has lived here for 30-plus years and is a prominent businessman,” Gary Hankins, who lives across the road, said about the suspected shooter’s father. “He’s a true blue American who works hard and did everything for his kids.” Hankins said the elder Ciancia is involved in local youth sports and worked hard to build his auto body business in order to give his kids a good education. Hankins said his heart goes out to the parents and siblings who are left to make sense of the tragedy allegedly caused by their son and brother in Los Angeles.   “People have to understand that when your kids leave, you have to hope and pray that you did your best,” Hankins said. “It’s not (the family’s) fault.” The news about Pennsville’s connection to the LAX shooting spread quickly. People driving down the stretch of road outside the home slowed to peer down the long driveway and stopped to chat with neighbors. People dining at the local Burger King said they knew about the shooting and were following developments via online media. On Saturday evening, residents gathered at AJ’s Tavern and Restaurant on the main strip in town. The sign out front promised live music and a new menu, complete with prime rib.   All of the people inside the bar had heard what happened in Los Angeles but had little to say about the family. The suspected shooter’s father, Paul Ciancia, is well-known in the community. The elder Ciancia is known to carry a “huge wad of cash,” said Judy Norkis, a bartender at AJ’s. In this town, most of the workers hold blue-collar jobs at the local factories and oil refineries. Most townsmen are Dupont workers or retirees. Others work for ExxonMobil or BP, and some collect a paycheck working at “nuclear island,” the nickname for a nearby nuclear power plant.   According to residents, the Ciancia family is one of the richest in town. The kids went to a private school in nearby Delaware, about 10 miles west of Pennsville, and the family took vacations to tropical destinations such as Jamaica. Duane Samuels, 60, enjoys living in his hometown but claims the taxes are too high and there are too many police officers. He was casual friends with the elder Ciancia and went to his house a few times. “He was a hard worker,” Samuels said. “I didn’t even know he had kids.”   The 14,000 residents of Pennsville still carry on traditions of a long-gone era. Each year, the town crowns a Miss Pennsville and shuts down the streets to celebrate the end of summer with September Fest. Just days after Halloween, the town was still covered in cobwebs and plastic ghouls and monsters. “Everybody knows everybody here,” Norkis said. “It’s just too bad.” Jason Fields contributed to this report.

Spartanburg County deputies released this flier of a man investigators want to talk to about the unsolved killings of four people on the Superbike Motorsports motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., in November 2003.

(AP Photo/Spartanburg County Sherrif's Department) Spartanburg County deputies released this sketch of a man investigators want to talk to about the unsolved killings of four people on the Superbike Motorsports motorcycle shop in Chesnee, S.C., in November 2003. Authorities said he was in the shop less than an hour before the shootings.  (AP Photo/Spartanburg County Sherrif's Department) Tom and Lorraine Lucas looks at photos of the victims of a quadruple homicide in November 2003 at the motorcycle shop where their son worked, at their homein Spartanburg, S.C., on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2013. Deputies have not made any arrests after four people were killed at Superbike Motorsports. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins) After nearly 10 years and more than 750 leads, law enforcement officials and victims' families remain stumped in one of South Carolina's most heinous killings: A gunman who walked into a motorcycle shop, killed the owner and three employees, and slipped out undetected. Nov. 6 will mark a decade since the deaths at Superbike Motorsports in Spartanburg County, on a two-lane highway headed from the city toward the Blue Ridge Mountains. Sheriff Chuck Wright has vowed to get the killer off the street, but he now admits he may be waiting for a jailhouse confession. For the families of the store's owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper, the search for answers is taking a toll. The parents of one victim moved to South Carolina to find justice, but say their hopes that the killer will face justice are fading. Veteran law enforcement officials say that in recent state history, they can't remember another mass shooting remaining unsolved for so long. Investigators say all four victims were killed with the same 9 mm pistol. They think the killer came in the back, perhaps through an open garage door, and killed mechanic Chris Sherbert, 26, as he worked. Bookkeeper Beverly Guy, 52, was found just outside the bathroom in the middle of the showroom. Her son, shop owner Scott Ponder, 30, was found just outside the door in the parking lot, and service manager Brian Lucas, 29, in the doorway; officials say they may have been trying to run. They also cite evidence that the killer may have circled back and shot some victims in the head to ensure they were dead. He was a good shot: Officials say he missed his moving targets only a few times. [pullquote] Wright says that just before the deaths, Ponder had started a bill of sale for a motorcycle about to be sold. He hadn't written down the customer's name, credit card number or other identifying information. Investigators won't say whether there were unidentified fingerprints or DNA in the shop -- only that forensic evidence is limited. ""I think this one will be solved in the jailhouse,"" Wright recently told The Associated Press. ""There are very few cold-blooded killers who won't talk."" Wright was elected sheriff in 2004, about a year after the shootings. He said the investigation could have been handled better but wouldn't give specifics, mentioning only that crime scene technicians missed processing an entire room and had to return the next day. Wright and his investigators are pushing hard a revised sketch of a customer who was in the store less than an hour before the killings. When Wright released the drawing in March 2012, he said he thought that man was the killer. Now Wright says he's not so sure, but he still believes the man has information to crack the case. Investigators do think the killer was a disgruntled customer. Through the Internet, Ponder sold nationwide. A map in the sheriff's office has pushpins where Ponder's motorcycles were sold. Each pin is somewhere a suspect might live, a place where investigators want to get the word out. The victims' families have their theories, too. ""It runs through my mind constantly,"" said Lorraine Lucas, the mother of Brian Lucas. ""I run that day through my head when I first wake up, and it is the last thing I do at night."" Time has given the families plenty of chances to come up with motives. Some are bizarre, they admit, but with no arrests, they say no one can be sure. Ponder was searching for his biological father, who disappeared decades ago -- maybe the killer didn't want the shop owner to learn about his dad. Maybe a rival motorcycle owner was angry about Ponder's success and decided to cut out the competition. Maybe the man who discovered the bodies should be looked at -- he saw Ponder and Lucas bleeding just outside the shop and stepped over his dead friends to call 911 from inside the shop even though he had a cellphone. ""We want them to look at every single angle, just not that it was a customer angry at the business,"" said Tom Lucas, Brian's father. On Nov. 6, the families will gather in Spartanburg to celebrate their loved ones' lives. One of the speakers will be Scotty Ponder, 9 -- his mother was pregnant with him when father Scott Ponder was killed. Since the shooting, Melissa Ponder has gone through two divorces. She said she was shattered over losing Scott and is now sorry she has brought men into her life and into that tough situation. ""I used to think, there's no way a crime this big is not going to get solved. But the fact somebody was able to pull the trigger, end four people's lives and go on their way and hasn't felt bad for 10 years, I don't know,"" she said. Tom and Lorraine Lucas also feel their hope fading. Tom Lucas said he looks down the road to the 20th anniversary of his son's death and can see himself with a walker, still raising hell. ""How can you get away with a killing like this?"" Lorraine Lucas said. The families say they understand that the sheriff's office is trying to solve the case, and Wright said it keeps him up at night, too. He said he doesn't fault the families for holding on to any theory or version of events. ""But in the end, I need probable cause. I need a case that can go to trial,"" Wright said. Terry Guy lost his wife, Beverly Guy, and his stepson. He said he used to dream that deputies would allow him into the killer's cell so he could get his own justice. But over the past 10 years, he's had a change of heart. He fell in love with and married Brian Lucas' sister. Now, Guy said, he just wants to offer the killer forgiveness, and he's sure of only one thing about the investigation. ""I know what I've done, and I know I didn't do it,"" Guy said. ""So who is a suspect? Everyone but me.""

X OUR PICKS: HARTFORD, Conn.—A private charitable fund created to help pay for the mental health care of first responders, teachers and other workers affected by the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school falls short of what’s needed to help those with long-term problems, including one police officer who cannot return to work, a union lawyer says. Connecticut lawmakers created the special Sandy Hook Workers’ Assistance Fund this year. They solicited donations from some of the state’s largest companies, as well as the general public, to help those affected by the Dec. 14 massacre in which 20 first-graders and six educators were gunned down, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. Though legislators estimated in March that several hundred thousand dollars had already been pledged and predicted more money would follow, just $218,361 was donated as of Sept. 30, according to the state’s Office of Victim Services. Eric Brown, staff attorney for AFSCME Council 15, suggested the fund probably requires $10 million or else a law needs to be passed to provide workers’ compensation coverage for mental health-related injuries, including post-traumatic stress. He didn’t say how many people he estimated that $10 million would cover. “The idea of this fund, while it was certainly a good idea and they have given some people an opportunity to pat themselves on the back and say they’ve done something, is completely inadequate,” Brown said. Many of the workers who could potentially benefit from the fund have access to insurance coverage to help pay for mental health care. Lawmakers created the fund to provide immediate, not long-term, relief to workers who had to take time off but were not compensated or had to pay for counseling and medication, said House Majority Leader Joseph Aresimowicz. But with the employment of at least one officer in jeopardy, Brown is seeking more help for the workers. The officer, who responded to the shooting, is too emotionally traumatized to work and faces possible termination, Brown said. The officer should have a hearing scheduled in coming weeks, he said. Because the officer, whom Brown would not name, did not suffer a physical impairment on the job, Brown said he is ineligible for a disability retirement. “We’re not talking about a short-term problem,” said Brown, adding that other officers report still suffering from nightmares and flashbacks and periodically have to take time off. “We’re talking about a long-term problem.” Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe said he could not comment on any particular case but said town officials are looking into the kinds of benefits that may be available to help officers “who cannot be police officers because of this event” and need to leave the force. “It’s certainly a delicate situation for us,” he said. “We recognize the sensitivity and we’re trying to do the best we can.” Connecticut law generally does not provide workers’ compensation benefits for mental or emotional impairments unless they stem from a work-related physical injury or occupational disease. In the wake of the shooting, state lawmakers considered legislation that would make public employees eligible for workers’ compensation if their job led them to witness death, maiming or their immediate aftermath. They would also receive coverage if they were diagnosed with a mental or emotional impairment because of what happened. The bill, however, died. Lawmakers were concerned about creating an expensive financial burden for municipalities and the state, said Aresimowicz, a Democrat from Berlin. The cost of a single post-traumatic stress case could range from several hundred thousand dollars to more than $1 million, depending on circumstances and duration of the claim, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities has said. “It wasn’t an area that we could get total agreement on it,” Aresimowicz said. But he said he’s willing to revisit the issue when the General Assembly reconvenes in February. “I really think it’s something we should talk about,” he said. The fund may be saved by a lack of interest. State lawmakers had originally estimated that 150 to 200 employees would be helped by the special account, but so far, just 58 people have applied for funds. Twenty were approved and received a total of $71,294, mostly for lost wages. Only $903.94 was paid for medical losses, a figure that likely includes insurance copayments. The other applicants have yet to submit bills for reimbursement, said Linda Cimino, director of the Office of Victim Services; no applicants were denied. Though the amount of contributions so far is a concern, the office has not received any new applications lately, Cimino said. The deadline for submitting applications for reimbursement is June 30 and the fund cannot distribute money after Aug. 30, 2015. “If demand stays as it is, the fund may remain solvent,” Cimino said in an email. “But if there is an increase in applications and requests for funds, the balance may not be sufficient.” Legislative leaders said they’re committed to raising more donations if it becomes necessary.

41,http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/08/when-mass-shootings-dont-matter-to-the-media/,"First, the bad news: as you’ve no doubt heard, there was another mass shooting. Nine people shot, three dead. The good news: A “person of interest has been taken into custody. DETROIT – A convicted felon who was wearing body armor when police arrested him in a Detroit suburb will be questioned in an investigation into the fatal shooting of three men in a back gambling room of an east side barbershop. Detroit Police Chief James Craig described the man as a person of interest in Wednesday evening’s shooting at Al’s Barber Shop that left six other people wounded. Speaking at a Thursday news conference at police headquarters, Craig said the bloodshed may have stemmed from an ongoing feud. Craig did not name the person of interest and provided few details about the arrest. He said Rochester police picked up the man north of Detroit without incident on an unrelated felonious assault charge. That’s pretty terrible. And of course, the reason you must know about it is that the press must be all over this story, right? Well… not so much. I heard seond hand that CNN had done a fifteen second throw before commercial on it. Buzzfeed managed five whole sentences about it. ABC News put up a 26 second video segment. Huffpo – always quick like a bunny to talk about the evils of guns when so much as a single person is injured – managed a fair number of paragraphs. But it was entirely factual, with no opinions on the causes, the evils of society or what have you. In short, this story essentially hit the mute button wall shortly after it hit the air. Why is this? Could it be that the shooter(s) and the victims didn’t fit the right profile? Lorne Carter told the Detroit Free Press that he was smoking a cigarette against the wall of a nearby business when he heard what sounded like 30 to 40 rapid shots. Detroit has one of the highest violent crime rates in the country. Including Wednesday night’s barbershop slayings, 289 criminal homicides have been committed so far this year in Detroit. Criminal homicides accounted for 386 of the 461 death investigations in 2012. “Anytime you have … shootings of nine, it certainly does rise up as one of Detroit’s more violent incidents,” Craig said. Craig said one person was shot and three others wounded during a shooting in October 2012 on the city’s west side. Seven teenagers _ including five students at Cody Ninth Grade Academy _ were shot and wounded while waiting at a bus stop near that school in June 2009. This took place on the East side of Detroit. I wonder what could be missing from this story which prevents the scholars at MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times from launching into a lengthy tirade on the evils of guns and the deplorable lack of safety for citizens? Could it, perchance, be that the shooter didn’t fit a particular profile? Were the victims, gathered together in a back room for an evening of gambling, not quite sympathetic enough figures? Were their lives somehow less valuable or the shooter not quite evil enough? Or – just maybe – does this shooting not fit the right profile to make tasty political sausage? Does the fact that this city already has some of the most restrictive gun restriction laws in the country make it somehow less newsworthy?

Every Monday A Christian Science perspective: Superstorm Sandy remembered in an effort to be love-affirming instead of loss-affirming. November 1, 2013 This week marks the first anniversary of superstorm Sandy – the largest Atlantic storm on record and one that affected residents in seven countries and across 24 US states. While I live hundreds of miles from Sandy’s path, the storm hit close to home in a different way, through the sinking of the tall ship HMS Bounty, and the loss of her captain and a female crew member. In my 20s I had worked as a deckhand on a similar vessel, and the Bounty’s captain had been one of my co-workers for several months. While many in the sailing community and around the world rejoiced in the safe and heroic rescue of the majority of the Bounty crew, there was also an overwhelming surge of sadness at the loss of life and the loss of a beloved vessel. Recently, as I’ve watched this date approach on my calendar, I’ve wondered how spiritual thinkers can best support anniversaries such as this one – when a devastating storm, the passing of a loved one, a mass shooting, or specific terror attack resurfaces in our minds and hearts. Certainly there can be a natural desire to honor the memory of loved ones, but it might also be worthwhile to ask whether the spirit of that commemoration is loss-affirming or love-affirming. As a student of Christian Science, I regularly turn to the Bible for instruction and support. The life of Christ Jesus provides powerful examples of love-affirming action in the face of loss. Jesus’ examples of walking over the waves and stilling a storm give us permission to get on top of waves of sadness and silence stormy blasts of regret. His compassionate presence at a funeral (see Luke, Chap. 7) halted the procession of grief and reversed the evidence from death and sorrow to life and rejoicing. At the passing of his friend Lazarus, the Master Christian moved beyond his response at one point of weeping and groaning (see John 11:33, 35) to command that the stone be rolled away from the tomb so that Lazarus could be loosed from his burial shroud. In her primary work, “Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,” the discoverer of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, writes, “Jesus said (John viii. 51), ‘If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.’ That statement is not confined to spiritual life, but includes all the phenomena of existence. Jesus demonstrated this, healing the dying and raising the dead” (pp. 429-430). Jesus must have had a fathomless sense of the presence, power, and continuity of divine Love in order to triumph repeatedly over destruction and death (including his own). His healing record stands for us to follow today. A year ago this week I was not at my best. While I tried to be prayerful and supportive of everyone who was feeling the effects of superstorm Sandy, I was more in “weeping and groaning” mode as I struggled with the grief and loss surrounding the Bounty and her captain. I cried through most of the Wednesday night testimony meeting at our local Christian Science church. Toward the end of the service, however, I received a very clear healing message in thought: “I am the God of the miners.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. This was a precise reference to another situation I had prayed about two years earlier when 33 Chilean miners were trapped in a mine. On the surface, it seemed like a strange juxtaposition – a reminder of the joyous and successful return of the miners to safety versus the very recent loss of life and ship with the Bounty. But I recognized the message as a powerful assurance that God’s love was and is on the scene, despite all outward appearances. To this day, when reminded of the Bounty, I reaffirm that the God of the miners comforts and companions the captain, crew, family, and all within the tall ship community. It may take ongoing practice to consistently affirm the love of God in the midst of trials and in the wake of memories. Thankfully, Christ Jesus charts a course that fixes thought on the omnipotence and omnipresence of divine Love. In this way we can learn, know, and rejoice with the Apostle Paul’s assurance to the Corinthians, “Death is swallowed up in victory” (I Corinthians 15:54). Already a subscriber?

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. RICHMOND, Va. – The state Supreme Court has reversed a jury's wrongful death verdict against the state stemming from the killings of 32 students and faculty at Virginia Tech in 2007. In a decision issued Thursday, the justices say the state had no duty to warn students of the potential acts of a lone student-gunman who initially shot two in a dormitory before killing 30 more people. He then killed himself. Jurors in Montgomery County ruled in March 2012 that the state was negligent in the deaths of two students killed on Tech's Blacksburg campus in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Jurors awarded the families of both students $4 million each, but a judge reduced the award to the state cap of $100,000 for each family.

52,http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/15/wayne-lapierre-obamas-obsession-with-our-gun-rights/,"By Wayne LaPierre, NRA Barack Obama, the candidate who promised Americans in 2008 that “I will not take your guns away,” now, as President of the United States in 2013, has embraced the universal firearm confiscation of Australia and England—schemes that saw the destruction of hundreds of thousands of registered, legal firearms that had been outlawed and taken under threat of force from licensed gun owners by their governments. Obama revealed his gun control endgame in a Sept. 22, 2013, political speech at a solemn memorial for the 12 Washington Navy Yard victims murdered by a deranged killer on Sept. 16, 2013. Obama coldly used the madness of a delusional lone mass-murderer to claim that the rampage “ought to lead to some sort of transformation … it ought to obsess us.” In the same breath, Obama defined his personal “obsession” and his notion of “transformation” for ordinary American gun owners: “That’s what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies. In the United Kingdom, in Australia … they mobilized and they changed.” The Washington Post praised Obama’s demand for “transformation” to an Australia-style gun roundup and destruction as “commonsense.” While the U.S. media either ignored or glossed over Obama’s embrace of the Aussie model for gun bans, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Sept. 23, 2013, led its coverage with this: “The U.S. president, Barack Obama, says it’s time for America to follow the example of countries like Australia when it comes to gun control.” With a Sept. 23, 2013, headline, “Obama hails Australian gun laws,” Sky News led its coverage with: “President Barack Obama has used Australia as a positive example of a country that tightened gun laws after a mass shooting.” Virtually no U.S. media outlet was honest enough to describe what actually happened to our formerly free English speaking cousins as a direct result of mass murders committed by lone, criminally insane killers. In reaction to the murder of 16 people in Hungerford in 1987 by an insane killer, registered semi-automatic rifles in Great Britain were banned and confiscated from all licensed owners. Then, following the 1996 massacre of school children in Dunblane, Scotland, most registered handguns were declared contraband, taken and destroyed. Owners of .22-cal. handguns had been allowed to keep them at government approved facilities, but they, too, were outlawed, collected and destroyed—because of the actions of two criminal lunatics. On the heels of the Dunblane killings in 1996, an insane murderer in Australia, who obtained one of his semi-automatic rifles by killing its owner and his wife, slaughtered 34 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania. As a result, all semi-automatic rifles, including .22s, and all semi-automatic shotguns and pump shotguns were banned, and licensed owners were required to turn them in for destruction under what the government, as in England, called a “buyback.” In reality, the “buybacks” were theft—made possible by using pre-existing government lists of licensed owners and registered guns. All of this explains Obama’s obsessive call for “universal background checks”—a scheme easily morphed into gun-owner registration. The president’s notion of crafting a U.S. version of the Australian/British tyranny has not come in a vacuum. It has been preceded by a spate of articles designed to introduce the public to the concept. Key to this propaganda push was a Jan. 16, 2013, New York Times op-ed by former Aussie Prime Minister John Howard, titled “I Went After Guns. Obama Can, Too.” In it, Howard touted his politics of forcibly disarming licensed law-abiding Australians: “City dwellers supported our plan, but there was strong resistance by some in rural Australia. Many farmers resented being told to surrender weapons they had used safely all of their lives. Penalizing decent, law-abiding citizens because of the criminal behavior of others seemed unfair. Many of them … felt bewildered and betrayed by these new laws. I understood their misgivings. Yet I felt there was no alternative.” And Howard boasted, “Almost 700,000 guns were bought back and destroyed—the equivalent of 40 million guns in the United States.” (Emphasis added) Understand that Australia is perhaps the most urbanized nation in the world where coastal, non-gun-owning city dwellers dwarf rural populations who have a long firearm tradition. But today it is those urbanites in places like Sydney who are reaping the real consequences of John Howard’s multiple “buybacks.” Criminal violence with illegal firearms in those urban centers is soaring. Try these headlines from one month before the U.S. Washington Navy Yard murders: From the Ballina Shire Advocate, Aug. 21, 2013, “New plan unveiled to tackle out-of-control gun violence.” Or this from News Limited Network Aug. 2, 2013, “Is Australia staring down the barrel of a gun crisis?” “There is a gun battle going on in Australia. As bike gang members and drug dealers gun each other down on a regular basis, sending fear through the community, authorities seem to be fighting a losing battle to keep firearms out of their hands.” As for mass murders, Howard, who once summed up his optic on freedom saying, “I hate guns,” wrote in his New York Times op-ed: “The fundamental problem was the ready availability of high-powered weapons, which enabled people to convert their murderous impulses into mass killing.” “People?” Ordinary citizens? The confiscatory bans were a hysterical response to the insanity of one person. One crazy person in Port Arthur. One crazy person in Hungerford. One crazy person in Dunblane. One crazy person in Aurora, Colo. One crazy person in Sandy Hook, Conn. And one crazy person at the Washington Navy Yard. All of these killers had one thing in common: all were totally and recognizably deranged. And nobody reacted to their insanity. Nobody interceded. In the case of the Navy Yard killer—a contract IT worker—police had warned the Navy he was a violent schizophrenic hearing voices and tormented by “extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves.” And he had a record of firearm abuse. Yet, he held a “secret” security clearance and carried a valid Navy ID that allowed him free access to military installations. And, as I said on “Meet the Press,” equally important in the Navy Yard killings was the lax base security in what amounts to a gun-free zone: “That can’t stand. We need to look at letting men and women who know firearms and are trained in them to do what they do best, which is protect and survive.” Yet Obama and his gun-ban cabal demand that millions of sane, ordinary peaceable Americans—you and me—pay the price for lone sociopaths with the loss of our rights. USA Today reported that Obama plans to bring his Australia/UK “transformation” and “obsession” to bear on the 2014 congressional elections. All I can say is “Bring it on, because Americans—by the millions upon millions—will fight to defend our freedom.” Join the NRA – click here ",2013-11-15 10:59:55,Wayne LaPierre: Obama’s obsession with our gun rights,,18775,http://dailycaller.com
53,http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/24/bloomberg-uses-photos-of-mass-murderers-to-attack-cuccinelli-video/,"The Virginia gubernatorial race has gotten so nasty that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has gone so far as to use photos of mass murderers to attack Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli. Bloomberg — a big proponent of gun control laws — is running ads against Cuccinelli ahead of the Nov. 5 election through his Independence USA PAC. The new ad — a $1.2 million buy airing on television in Northern Virginia — criticizes Cuccinelli’s views on gun control, while showing photos of “the dangerously mentally ill” and “criminals” from some of the country’s most gruesome shootings in recent history. Among those who make an appearance in the ad: Virginia Tech massacre shooter Seung-Hui Cho, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza and Aurora movie theater shooter James Holmes. And even though the region is still recovering from the mass shooting at Washington’s Navy Yard last month, the ad includes a photo from a security camera of shooter Aaron Alexis holding his Remington 870 shotgun during his rampage. “The gun show loophole,” the ad begins. “It means anyone can buy a gun without a background check. The dangerously mentally ill. Criminals. Endangering our families.” The ad continues: “Ken Cuccinelli opposed closing the gun show loophole — against comprehensive background checks at gun shows for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill, siding with the NRA and undermining law enforcement.” But is Bloomberg being misleading by tying Cuccinelli and the so-called gun show loophole to these mass murders? Gun rights activists often point out that the proposed legislation would not have stopped any of these shootings because none of these murderers were impeded by background checks. As for the Virginia Tech shooter: Cho passed the FBI NICS background check.

Almost half—49%—of the country believes legislation should be “more strict,” according to a new Gallup poll released Friday. Thirty-seven percent think the laws should be “kept as now,” and 13% want “less strict” laws. Public support for stricter gun laws was at 58% in the days after the shooting in Newtown, Conn. Opposition to banning handgun ownership remains at 74%, a record-high that was the same last year. Just one in four Americans believe the law should limit possession to authorized personnel, according to the poll. The majority of Democrats—77%—are in favor of tightening gun laws, but only 23% of Republicans voted similarly. Additionally, 37% of Democrats and 16% of Republicans support a ban on the possession of handguns. Favorability for stricter gun laws fell to record lows—44% and 43%—between 2009 and 2011. Gallup released the poll on the same day as destruction began of the Sandy Hook Elementary School building. Newtown residents voted in favor earlier this month to accept a $50 million grant to demolish the structure where 20 students and six educators were killed on Dec. 14. Students currently attend classes nearby at Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe. Razing is expected to end ahead of the shooting’s one-year anniversary, and the new building could open by December 2016. Related: Sandy Hook Elementary School demolition begins Fatal rampages and shooting attempts by gunmen around the country–in Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, DC, and most recently Nevada–set off a national call for stricter gun policies. But the debate has faded from headlines after the Senate in April failed to pass a bipartisan background checks bill. The president last month said he fears mass killings are the ""new normal."" “We’re confronting yet another mass shooting,” President Obama said following last month's rampage at the Washington Navy Yard. “And today it happened on a military installation in our nation’s capital.

55,http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/moving-forward-guns-without-congress," Featured Shows MSNBC TV More More Shows Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows In the weeks since the Navy Yard shooting, the 17th mass shooting of 2013, those of us in favor of common-sense reforms have been told repeatedly that we are losing the fight. The inaction of Congress has been deemed the death knell of gun reform by both the gun lobby and the media. It’s true that Congress refuses to move on guns. We tried in April and the vote in the U.S. Senate came up short – despite pleas from Newtown and Aurora families, as well as moms like myself who know our children are safer when guns are responsibly regulated. But the people who say all is lost on gun reform seem to think the only path to changing our laws and culture is through federal legislation. Make no mistake: We’ll continue to work hard to get Congress to pass background check legislation, but until Congress gets its act together or we get a new Congress, we’re continuing the fight elsewhere. We’ve taken the struggle for reform to American businesses – and we are winning. When Mothers Against Drunk Driving began in 1980, drinking and driving was a generally accepted and more regular occurrence. But slowly, after tragic accidents and much heartbreak, MADD helped change the way Americans thought about alcohol and driving. Due to a newfound stigma and legal liability, Americans created the concept of “designated drivers,” bartenders started calling cabs for customers, police set up drunk driving checkpoints during happy hour traffic, and state legislatures started passing laws that made driving under the influence a criminal act. That same type of cultural shift must happen with guns. There is little stigma attached to customers bringing gun with them to the grocery store. There is no liability for gun owners who negligently shoot someone else or whose gun is used to cause harm. Thanks to hard work from the gun lobby, gun manufacturers are not held liable for their products.  As a result, manufacturers have no financial incentive to make product improvements that would prevent injuries and save lives. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America is working hard to affect this shift. Members across the country are educating other moms about the lax gun laws and policies that contribute to so much senseless death in America. And we will continue our work one law at a time, one business at a time, until the culture shifts back toward responsibility and safety. Slowly, we’re making progress. In September, Starbucks, formerly known as a friend to gun enthusiasts, reversed its policy of allowing guns inside its stores. Previously, the store had refused to take a stand on banning guns and, as a result, gun advocates armed with everything from Glocks to semi-automatic rifles regularly met at local Starbucks. These blatant displays of intimidation and bullying were intended to normalize open carry. The approach backfired. After months of pressure from Moms Demand Action – including our “Skip Starbucks Saturdays” – Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced that guns were no longer welcome in the chain’s 12,000 coffee shops. When Schultz told gun groups that they were no longer welcome in stores, he earned back the business of moms across the country and took an important stand as a business leader. Starbucks has set an example for other businesses across the country and shown them that it’s ok to stand up and acknowledge what study after study has shown – we are all safer when guns are not present. With the Starbucks win behind us, we're moving on to another national brand: Staples. While some individual Staples stores have elected to keep guns out, the company doesn’t yet have a policy to ban guns in its stores nationwide. Given a recent accidental shooting in a North Carolina Staples, we think it’s time the company step up and say that firearms don’t belong in their stores. Moms are intensifying our efforts to hold the company accountable to do the right thing and will be doing more in the weeks and months ahead until they put the safety of their communities and their customers first. We’re not giving up on our politicians in Washington– but we’re not waiting around for them either. We are going to keep fighting for reform, putting our money where are principles are and supporting those businesses that act in the interest of customer safety. The one thing we’re not doing is listening to the naysayers who have given up. The stakes are too high – and the damage too great – to sit back and hope things will change.

The families of the students, Julia Pryde and Erin Peterson, refused a state settlement in 2008 and sought damages of $10 million, asserting that the university had delayed a campuswide alert that might have saved lives. The gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, had shot two students shortly after 7 a.m. on April 16, 2007. Campus authorities delayed an alert in order to notify the students’ families and investigate further, the court ruling Thursday said. The alert went out about two hours later, minutes before Mr. Cho continued his rampage. He killed 32 students and faculty members before killing himself. A lower court ruled last year that the delay was negligent and awarded the families $4 million each, later reduced to $100,000. The Supreme Court disagreed. “Based on the limited information” the school had, it said, “it cannot be said that it was known or reasonably foreseeable that students in Norris Hall would fall victim to criminal harm.” The ruling “was very much a surprise,” said Robert T. Hall, a lawyer for the families. “If you have a duty to protect, a duty to keep safe, a duty to ensure safety, how do you do that if you don’t warn them there is a gunman on the loose?” The university said that it was “very pleased that the Supreme Court recognized and corrected the errors of the lower court which resulted in a faulty jury verdict.” Advertisement",2013-11-01 01:16:12,Virginia Tech Held Not Negligent in ’07 Killings,,1,http://nytimes.com
57,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/05/study_white_racism_linked_with_opposition_to_gun_control_partner/,"This piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard. As we digest the news of yet another high-profile gun crime, the conversation inevitably comes back to the question of why stricter gun-control laws are so difficult to pass in this country. There are a variety of explanations, of course, including the political clout of the National Rifle Association. But there are also deeper, psychological reasons why so many Americans would rather endure mass shooting after mass shooting rather than agree to any restrictions on gun ownership. And one of them, it appears, is ingrained racism. That’s the implication of a newly published study, which finds a link between gun ownership, opposition to gun control, and “symbolic racism”—racist attitudes that are not overt, but nevertheless color one’s view of the world. A research team led by Kerry O’Brien of Monash University in Australia reports a high score on a common measure of racial resentment increases the odds that a person will (a) have a gun in the house, and (b) be opposed to gun control. This holds true even after other “explanatory variables,” including political party affiliation, are taken into account. “The statistics on firearm-related suicides and homicides in the U.S. might reasonably be expected to convince U.S. citizens that action on reducing gun ownership and use would be beneficial to their health,” the researchers write in the online journal PLOS One. “Yet, U.S. whites oppose strong gun reform more than all other racial groups, despite a much greater likelihood that whites will kill themselves with their own guns (suicide) than be killed by someone else.” They conclude that these “paradoxical attitudes” among American whites—who oppose measures that would reduce their own risk of violent death—can be explained in part by “anti-black prejudice.” O’Brien and his colleagues analyzed data from several waves of the American National Election Studies, large-scale surveys that take place during federal election years. The sample of voters skewed slightly conservative: “Just over half (52 percent) of the sample had a gun in the home, 66 percent opposed bans on handguns in the home, and 52 percent reported support for permits to carry a concealed handgun.” After providing detailed demographic information, participants answered four questions taken from the Symbolic Racism Scale. Specifically, they expressed their level of agreement or disagreement (on a one-to-five scale) with statements such as, “It’s really a matter of some people not trying hard enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites.” O’Brien and his colleagues took a range of variables that could influence attitudes toward guns out of the equation, including age, income, education level, political ideology, party identification, and whether the person lived in the South. They then measured whether implicitly racist attitudes predicted greater support for guns and gun rights. Indeed they did. “For each one point increase in symbolic racism, there was a 50 percent greater odds of having a gun in the home,” they write, “and there was a 28 percent increase in the odds of supporting permits to carry concealed handguns.” In contrast, there was no correlation between attitudes toward guns and the one question that measured overt racism (whether they felt the word “violent” described “most blacks”). The researchers note that fewer than 10 percent of participants strongly endorsed that notion; they suspect a significant number recoiled from its blatantly prejudiced tone and answered negatively “in order to avoid appearing racist.” O’Brien and his colleagues caution that while the “view that racism underpins gun-related attitudes is plausible and supported by evidence,” their study shows correlation, not causation. It’s conceivable that “simply owning a firearm may lead whites to develop more negative attitudes towards blacks,” they write. Conceivable, but how likely? Either way, the researchers note, “the results indicate that symbolic racism is associated with gun-related attitudes and behaviors in U.S. whites.” That unpleasant fact will have to somehow be addressed before more stringent gun control becomes a reality.

Filed under: It's the go-to method for trauma relief — but nobody knows if psychological first aid actually works Last month, floodwaters dark with silt and mud devastated a 1,500-square-mile area surrounding Denver. Nine people lost their lives. Some survivors lost their homes, and others couldn't return because of the damage. Since those catastrophic days, Janine D'Anniballe has tried to help as many as she can. But unlike other responders, she's not delivering blankets or food. Instead, D'Anniballe is offering psychological first aid (PFA): developed several years ago, the technique is the primary mode for immediately buffering the traumatic effects of surviving a disaster. It's designed to stabilize victims who often feel numb, overwhelmed, and angry, and who may eventually spiral into depression or hopelessness.  PFA is widely used by agencies like the Red Cross and the World Health Organization. In the last year alone, for example, the Red Cross used PFA at the Sandy Hook massacre, Hurricane Sandy, and the Boston bombings. A psychologist by training, D'Anniballe has for the past six weeks been meeting survivors in vacant malls and gutted neighborhoods. In what are usually five to ten-minute encounters, she takes a matter-of-fact approach to topics like sleep quality and diet, or how to deal with insurance companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). But if survivors are emotional, she doesn't start an impromptu counseling session. ""This is a non-sexy intervention."" ""This is a non-sexy intervention, but it was sitting with that person in distress and validating that it's overwhelming,"" D'Anniballe says. ""I'm under no illusion this person won't feel overwhelmed and horrible many, many times, but in that moment, they felt a bit of relief."" The approach seems intuitively right. Restoring a person's sense of self-efficacy, while also normalizing grief and stress, seems like an obvious way to calm a trauma survivor, enhance resiliency, and maybe even ward off post-traumatic stress and depression. Pouring time and resources into efforts that might be fruitless But here's the quandary: though PFA has been widely adopted, no one has empirical data to validate whether it helps or harms survivors. Now, a study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) hopes to start solving that mystery.  And that's critical: even interventions with the best intentions may not make a difference or, worse yet, may aggravate symptoms of trauma. Meaning that without this research, responders around the world are pouring time and resources into efforts that might be fruitless.  A few years ago, Dr. Michael McCart was a clinician at the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center, where he regularly treated those traumatized by sexual and physical assault. Though about 80 percent of disaster and trauma survivors won't experience long-term psychological problems, that number plummets with crime victims; about one-third develop chronic disorders. Amongst rape and sexual assault victims, that can reach 40 percent. ""A way to prevent these symptoms from developing in the first place."" After reflecting on the painful journeys of his patients, McCart kept returning to a single question: ""I couldn't help but wonder if there might be a way to prevent these symptoms from developing in the first place,"" he says. PFA, with its emphasis on resiliency, coping, and self-efficacy, seemed like the best candidate. So McCart, now at the Medical University of South Carolina, is working with NIMH funding to examine whether the intervention actually decreases acute trauma symptoms in adult crime victims. His three-year study, which concludes in 2015, will be the first ever to assess PFA in a controlled, randomized setting. With about 150 participants, the study is small. Each victim will work with a police department-based advocate who traditionally helps fill out paperwork, goes to court, or offers emotional support. Some of those professionals will be trained in a version of PFA, while others will not. There are reasons to be hesitant about PFA If McCart's study demonstrates that PFA can benefit such a high-risk population, the results are likely to generate new interest and perhaps additional government funding — not to mention lend scientific credence to the technique. ""The reality is that a lot of money has been spent on training people and preparing manuals and discouraging other practices before we really know it's the right thing,"" says Farris Tuma, chief of the Traumatic Stress Research Program at the NIMH. There are reasons to be hesitant about PFA. After all, scientists and clinicians in this field have been disappointed by promising interventions before.  In the past, responders relied on a technique called debriefing. It was developed for first responders like firefighters and police officers. They would witness something terrible, then gather and discuss their feelings. The early evidence suggested that these men and women who shared an intense bond felt less alone. It made sense then to apply the same principle to other groups that had endured disasters. But these individuals were sometimes strangers, with no imperative to trust each other and no desire to relive the trauma en masse. Indeed, when debriefing was studied,  the data was disappointing. In many cases, debriefing didn't prevent or reduce stress or anxiety. It may even have made symptoms worse. ""Out of frustration,"" Tuma says, ""different parts of the mental health community started to ask, ‘What could we do?'"" It may even have made symptoms worse What they did was devise ""a recipe book"" of eight components essential to PFA. These include calming survivors, offering practical assistance, and providing information on coping skills. There are no therapy sessions or group discussions. Valerie Cole, manager of disaster health and mental health services for the Red Cross, says their clinicians and responders use PFA to provide immediate, short-term emotional and psychological relief. The hope is that it might even improve the odds of preventing PTSD and other chronic conditions. Of course, there's no conclusive data suggesting that it does. But ""I would love it if it did,"" Cole says. In theory, science could answer this question. But researchers have been stymied by the difficulty of conducting a study in the wake of a mass shooting or hurricane. By nature, these events are unpredictable and unleash chaos. Even if a study could be deployed, there are ethical concerns about recruiting participants and diverting resources from disaster response.  McCart believes his project avoids these complications. At the end of the month, advocates in the study will deliver PFA over two or three interactions in the weeks following a crime. For assault victims who know the perpetrator, advocates will use PFA's focus on safety to develop strategies to avoid that person and get a protection order if necessary. Advocates will also draw on PFA to help victims with practical considerations like housing, health and financial needs. Victims will be taught coping strategies and encouraged to maintain strong ties with family and friends, both central components of PFA. ""The bottom line is we have no idea if ... it prevents anxiety or depression."" By next summer, McCart and his team will start analyzing data to see if victims given PFA show greater reductions in PTSD, depression, and general anxiety symptoms relative to the comparison group. They'll also track measures like work performance and substance use. If this novel research pans out, experts say it might finally offer evidence for a practical way to steer survivors towards healthy recovery following trauma — a goal that's remained elusive for years.  ""Taking off my scientist hat, I have no quibbles or problems with PFA,"" says Tuma of the NIMH. ""But the bottom line is we have no idea if it's better than engaging people another way, or if it prevents anxiety or depression. So we're trying to help get the data.""

By ASSOCIATED PRESS 10/21/2013 02:23 PM EDT WASHINGTON  — Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday the average number of mass shooting incidents has tripled in recent years. Between 2000 and 2008, the U.S. experienced an average of five mass shootings every year. Since then the annual average has tripled, Holder said. So far in 2013, there have been at least 12, he said. According to Justice Department figures on mass shootings, 404 people were shot and 207 people were killed from 2009 to 2012. From 2000 to 2008, 324 people were shot and 145 were killed. In remarks to the annual conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the attorney general said that in the past decade, the Justice Department has helped train 50,000 front-line officers, more than 7,000 on-scene commanders and over 3,000 local, state and federal agency heads on how to respond to active shooters. To disrupt planned shootings and other attacks, the FBI's Behavioral Threat Assessment Center works every day with local police and other levels law enforcement to assess people who may be contemplating violence. Since 2011, the center has reported hundreds of successful disruptions, including an anticipated 150 this year alone, Holder said. Missing out on the latest scoops?

60,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2013/10/23/military-training-doc-anti-christian-splc-a-trusted-source-to-define-extremism/," Fox News’s Todd Starnes reported Wednesday on a Ft. Hood briefing where reportedly soldiers were told that evangelical Christians and Tea Party supporters are a threat to the United States and are “tearing the nation apart.” Soldiers were reportedly told that they could be charged with committing a military crime if they supported or donated to such organizations. Ft. Hood denies these allegations, but a separate source claiming to have been present during the briefing asserts the original account is true. Ironically, in the place where an Islamic radical–Maj. Nidal Hassan–committed an act of terrorism that murdered fourteen Americans, including the unborn child of one of the female victims–a presentation on terrorism singled out Bible-believing Christians and supporters of the Constitution as serious threats to this nation. Islamic terrorism was barely mentioned. This is just the latest outrage in a long train of disgraces. Just days ago, soldiers at Camp Shelby in Mississippi were instructed that the Christian conservative American Family Association is a domestic hate group. A month earlier, a security presentation portrayed the Founding Fathers as extremists. Before that, Breitbart News reported on a Christian chaplain who was officially censored by military commanders for talking about the importance of religious faith. And several months before that, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, instructed soldiers that traditional Christian beliefs are incompatible with “Army values.” All this started in April, when Breitbart News broke the story of top Pentagon brass meeting with an anti-Christian activist calling for court-martialing observant Christians who share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others in the military. This activist calls them “fundamentalist monsters” who are “enemies of the Constitution” and should be punished for “sedition and treason.” All along, the nation was told these were a series of isolated incidents, not authorized by military leadership. Now military documents suggest otherwise. Judicial Watch used a FOIA request (Freedom of Information Act) to obtain a document from the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute (DEOMI), which is part of the Department of Defense (DOD). In this 133-page training document, entitled “Extremism,” on pages 32-33, under “Lesson Emphasis,” it claims to: provide[s] information that describes sources of extremism information, definitions, recruitment of DoD personnel, common themes in extremist ideologies, common characteristics of extremist organizations, DoD policies, and command functions regarding extremist activities. On the same page, it cites the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as an approved source for information–and its affiliate Teaching Tolerance. It was SPLC that labeled the American Family Association a “domestic hate group,” along with the Family Research Council (FRC, where I do religious liberty work as a senior fellow), the Traditional Values Coalition, and various Tea Party organizations and conservative border-security/immigration groups. In short, SPLC labels as hate groups organizations that promote a traditional Christian view of marriage and other social issues, believe in border enforcement, or promote constitutional limited government. Ironically, SPLC is the only group in this news report linked to terrorism, as convicted domestic terrorist Floyd Lee Corkins told the FBI in a videotaped and signed confession that he chose his targets for an attempted mass-shooting at FRC from SPLC’s hate group list, including a map of how to get to FRC’s office. He then had the names and locations of other traditional groups he was going to target after murdering whoever he could in FRC’s building. This DEOMI document goes on several pages later to say that service members cannot participate in such organizations, raise funds for them, encourage others to support them, or attend public rallies organized by them. It then adds, “Furthering the objectives of extremist organizations is viewed as detrimental to the good order, discipline, or mission accomplishment of the unit and is, therefore, subject to appropriate disciplinary action.” It tasks service members with “assist[ing] unit commanders in being vigilant about the existence of such activities.” Is this DEOMI training material the fountainhead of this growing anti-Christian discrimination? And if so, who wrote it, and who authorized it? Or is this training document just the result of something else, coming from higher up the food chain in the Pentagon? Michael Berry is a lawyer at Liberty Institute, which is investigating this matter. He tells Breitbart News: The Army’s responses that these are isolated incidents raise more questions than answers. The incidents comprising this disturbing trend all seem to have one thing in common in that they use similar terminology. And that language appears to come from a document produced by DEOMI. It may not be a smoking gun, but it might be a bunch of shell casings. Berry tells us that he has been contacted by someone who works at DEOMI and is gravely concerned about this developing situation. Congress is empowered by Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution with establishing the training and discipline of the military. Congress needs to get to the bottom of this–quickly.

Labor Committee Chairman James Konczos, claiming the Capitol Police have a “culture of refusing to get involved in assisting the Washington, D.C., community,” is asking Congress to investigate why a highly trained team of four officers responding to the mass shooting on Sept. 16 was called back to protect the Capitol. But House Republicans charged with oversight of the Capitol Police forces say they have no reason to question the work of a review team led by Assistant Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger that spent weeks interviewing dozens of personnel and others, reviewing written reports, radio transmissions and command center logs. Stenger’s fact review team was established by the Capitol Police Board — Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer, House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, Architect of the Capitol Stephen T. Ayers and Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine — at Dine’s request, in response to questions raised about the department’s response. House Administration Chairwoman Candice S. Miller called the findings of the report “exhaustive” and “thorough,” and she praised the professionalism of the Containment and Emergency Response Team. “You’ve got all of this traffic as far as what was on the radios and everything, so that it was very clear exactly how everything went,” the Michigan Republican told CQ Roll Call. “I don’t have any reason to question the investigation.“ In its two-page statement on the findings, the Capitol Police Board says the four-person CERT unit self-deployed to 11th and M streets Southeast and was then directed to head to the Navy Yard incident command post, but “traffic gridlock” prevented it from getting there. The union disputes that claim, saying that the CERT officers arrived at the incident command post within minutes of the first call for assistance but relocated to ensure other first responders could reach the incident while they awaited further instructions from the Capitol Police. The unit was recalled to the Capitol more than 30 minutes after reports of the attack. “The facts are clear that the CERT was initially directed to the incident command post, and the facts are clear that they did not make it to the incident command post,” Irving said. “We also have radio transmissions from a Capitol Police unit at the command post that reflected they would be unable to make it due to heavy traffic congestion” Konczos relies on initial reports from officers in the vicinity of Navy Yard, and reported by the BBC. He also doubts the board’s ability to produce an unbiased report, since its members were responsible for high-level security decisions that day, including the decision to put parts of the Capitol on lockdown. Gainer said Konczos has neither the facts nor the investigative experience to question the review and that the union chairman did not respond to “attempts by the chief of police to be briefed in depth on the review and its findings.” The House Administration Committee has not announced plans to investigate police actions, but Konczos told CQ Roll Call he is “still working on that.” Miller said she keeps in touch with the union but has not talked to it on this particular issue. She said she is certain to talk about the board’s report during an upcoming meeting with Dine. “I keep a very open door and line of communication, whether it’s management or labor,” she said. “Each side has something to say certainly, and I want to hear it all.” Rep. Robert A. Brady, D-Pa., ranking member on the House Administration Committee, did not have a comment for this story. After reviewing the details of the board’s report, fellow House Administration Committee member Gregg Harper, R-Miss., found the  investigation to be thorough. “I’m satisfied that they did a really valid attempt to get to the bottom in the facts and the timeline,” he said.",2013-11-14 00:00:00,Congress Unlikely to Intervene in 'Stand Down' Controversy - Roll Call,"politics and government,labor,police",19854,http://www.rollcall.com
