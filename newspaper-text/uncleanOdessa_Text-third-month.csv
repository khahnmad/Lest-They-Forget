1,https://www.ocregister.com/2019/10/29/several-people-injured-in-long-beach-shooting-some-fatalities-reported/,"Trending: At least one gunman was on the loose Wednesday evening, Oct. 30, after a shooting the night before, at a house party in Long Beach’s historic Rose Park neighborhood, left three men in their 20s dead and nine other people injured — a casualty count that amounts to one of the worst single acts of mass violence in the city’s history. About 25-30 people gathered at a house in the 2700 block of East Seventh Street, near Ohio Avenue, Tuesday evening. Initial reports indicated they were there for a Halloween party, though investigators also heard it could have been a birthday or office party, Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna said during a news conference Wednesday morning. Many of the guests, Luna added, worked together at a company outside Long Beach. The revelry turned to tragedy when gunfire from an alley behind the house tore through the backyard, Luna said. The wounded were between 20 and 49 years old, and from cities throughout the Southland — from Anaheim to the South Bay. They were shot in the upper and lower torsos, added police spokeswoman Jennifer De Prez. The suspect or suspects then fled in a dark-colored vehicle. Two police officers arrived within one minute of receiving the call, according to a department statement Wednesday afternoon, and directed the guests to help each other to safety. What the officers saw when they arrived, Luna said, was a horrific crime scene — with “blood everywhere.” Over the next several hours, sirens from police and fire vehicles echoed along Seventh Street while helicopters whirred overhead, piercing the early morning stillness in this typically quiet residential neighborhood. Homicide detectives worked through the night, Luna said. “Today is a tragic and horrific day in Long Beach,” said Mayor Robert Garcia. “This is not reflective of Long Beach or our community.”  The coroner van takes the victims of a shooting that killed 3 and wounded 9 Tuesday night in the 2700 block of 7th Street near Ohio Avenue in Long Beach on Wednesday, October. 30, 2019.

(Photo by OnScene.TV)  Tuesday’s shooting had the most victims in a single incident since Luna began his law-enforcement career in Long Beach nearly 34 years ago, the chief said. But it also happened less than a week after a shooting at a North Long Beach bar left one man and the gunman dead, and another injured — an incident officials said could have been more deadly if not for quick actions by those who reported it and the officers who confronted the suspect. The Rose Park shooting also followed Gov. Gavin Newsom signing 15 gun-related laws earlier this month. Long Beach police have not disclosed the type of firearm or firearms involved in Tuesday’s shooting. Investigators, Luna said, have a lot of casings to inspect. As of Wednesday afternoon, according to a Police Department statement, investigators only have a cursory description of a single suspect: A man — of unknown age, race or ethnicity — in dark clothing, with his face concealed. We have 12 victims that have been shot in this horrific act of gun violence. 3 are dead. The LBPD is working very hard to catch the person or persons who committed this cowardly act. Please keep your love and prayers focused on the victims that are still being treated. — Robert Garcia (@RobertGarciaLB) October 30, 2019  But the department has left open the possibility that there could be more than one gunman, referring in statements to “unknown suspect(s).” Investigators would canvass the neighborhood and look at all available surveillance footage, Luna said Wednesday morning. Regardless, police do not believe this was a random act of violence; they also, according to a statement, do not think it’s gang-related. “I don’t believe it was random,” Luna said, adding that investigators don’t yet have a motive. “He didn’t just walk up to that house.” The three men killed during the shooting were pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. Their names will not be released until officials notify their next of kin. The injured victims, police said, were taken to local hospitals. Officials did not disclose their identities but did provide the ages, genders and cities of residence for the victims. They are: Some of the injured, De Prez said during the predawn hours Wednesday, were in critical-stable condition, while others were in stable condition. Shaunna Dandoy, another police spokeswoman, said Wednesday evening that there was no update on their conditions. As police and fire officials talked among themselves around 1 a.m. Wednesday, a woman got out of a car and approached them, saying her cousin was one of the victims. She frantically asked for more information, including to which hospitals the injured were taken. Officials briefly spoke to her, then she ran back to her car and drove off. Several others also milled about in the hours following the shooting, asking police for updates on loved ones who may have been at the party. At least one of the wounded, though, will ultimately be OK — at least according to her brother. Around 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, a 29-year-old Gardena man showed up at the crime scene after visiting his sister — who he said was shot five times — in the hospital. “She’s doing good,” the man said. “She should make a full recovery.” The man said his sister told him that she had been at the house for a Halloween and birthday party with coworkers. She was in the backyard grabbing a drink from a cooler when the gunfire began. She turned to run and was shot in the leg and back, the man said. The woman also told her brother that she saw two men shooting. While the woman will recover, another relative who was at the party has not yet turned up. The Gardena man said he was searching for information about that relative — but has not heard from him.

Oscar Cancio, 33, was unloading hockey equipment from his car in a parking lot on Seventh and Walnut Avenue Tuesday night when he heard nine-to-11 gunshots. He initially thought they were fireworks. Then he heard a helicopter circling overhead and sirens approaching. He became worried about his neighbors and headed toward the commotion. He found police tape lining the yard of a residence next to a nail salon, near Seventh Street and Temple Avenue. He saw three people who lay still atop stretchers, being taken from the building. Others, dressed in costumes, limped out of the house. It was a startling scene for the neighborhood, composed mostly of single-family homes — many of them American Craftsman from the early-to-mid 20th century — with a smattering of apartment complexes. Pedestrians and bicyclists can be seen here often, day or night. “You don’t really hear about big shootings here, so for this to happen in our neighborhood feels awful,” said Cancio, director of admissions at Vistamar School, in El Segundo. “You don’t feel good walking in the street after something like this.” Lambert Alcendor, 21, has lived in the area for nearly four years. He was walking to a nearby liquor store when he saw a car swerving in front of the nail salon on Seventh Street and heard 20-30 shots fired, Alcendor said. “I definitely heard a lot of shots,” he said. “And that’s when I started running.” Alcendor said he ducked behind a car on Seventh Street, near Gladys Avenue, and when he looked back, the car was gone. While Alcendor hid, Donna Coats slept. Met a woman walking her dog on Ohio Avenue this morning. She’s lived on Molino Ave., a block away from the shooting, for 40 years. A flurry of texts asking if she was all right. Described the neighborhood as sleepy. — Chris Haire (@CJHaire) October 30, 2019  Coats, 63, has lived on Molino Avenue, one street over from the shooting, for 40 years. The gunfire and the stream of sirens didn’t wake her. But a flurry of texts, asking if she was all right, finally did — hours later. Around 5:30 a.m. Wednesday, Coats and her dog, Walter, went on their usual morning walk. “This is crazy,” Coats said. “The most exciting thing that’s happened here is when a squirrel chewed through a wire and shut off the power.” On Ohio Avenue, near Seventh Street, Coats stopped to take photos of the crime scene while Walter, a rottweiler-German shepherd mix, sniffed a tree. A police officer yelled at Coats to stay behind the yellow tape. Coats, a former neighborhood watch captain, said she usually takes Walter past the nail salon — as she did last night, about an hour before the shooting. Her sister and daughter, who both live with her, go to that salon. “This is a quiet, sleepy neighborhood,” she said. “Nothing like this has ever happened.” Nearly three hours later, Luna stood in front of microphones — with Garcia behind him — and called on the public to help deliver justice for the victims, their families, the community. “I know people have information about who this coward is,” the police chief said. “I hope they come forward so we can give the families the peace of mind that this coward is in jail.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

Pediatricians are much more likely to ask about functional smoke alarms than about household gun safety, according to a new research letter published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. What’s more, pediatric residents become increasingly less likely to inquire about gun safety following a mass shooting, researchers found. Though the study didn’t capture the reasons behind these trends, residents may be avoiding discussing the risk of gun deaths soon after a mass shooting to protect themselves or parents from thinking about traumatic events that just occurred, said lead study author Carole Stipelman, a pediatrician and associate professor at the University of Utah School of Medicine. “Avoidance is a common response to trauma,” she told MarketWatch. “Avoidance is one of the criteria that defines post-traumatic stress syndrome, and a mass shooting is a shared community traumatic event.” The second leading cause of death among U.S. children and teens aged 1 to 19 in 2016 was gun-related injuries, coming in behind motor-vehicle crashes, according to 2018 research published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And while U.S. gun owners with kids are more likely than non-parents to keep firearms unloaded and locked away, three in 10 gun owners who have kids under 18 at home report having a firearm that’s “both loaded and easily accessible to them all of the time” while they’re at home, according to the Pew Research Center. Some 7% of kids in the U.S. — translating to 4.6 million children — live in households with at least one unlocked and loaded gun, one national 2015 survey showed, double estimates from 2002. “This is another child safety issue that we talk about — just like smoke alarms, bike helmets [or] car seats,” Stipelman said. In the present study, Stipelman and her co-authors analyzed data from 16,576 regular pediatric visits involving 77 pediatric residents and 26 faculty members from January 2017 through June 2018, a stretch of time that included the deadly Oct. 1, 2017 Las Vegas music-festival shooting and Feb. 14, 2018 Parkland, Fla., school shooting. They supplemented the screening with safety questions about working smoke alarms and gun storage. Both pediatric residents and faculty pediatricians were more likely to ask parents about smoke-alarm safety than about gun safety throughout the study, the researchers found. And in the months following a mass shooting, residents steadily decreased their likelihood of asking about gun safety, despite previously being more enthusiastic than their faculty counterparts about asking: Following the Las Vegas shooting, there was a roughly 1% decline each week in their asking about guns. Despite an initial 16% spike in gun-safety questions after Parkland — the high-school mass shooting may have presented “a reminder we should be asking about it,” Stipelman said — the rate of asking then declined in the same fashion. Stipelman’s interpretation as to why her team found this pattern among residents rather than faculty: “With more experience, doctors learn how to continue to function professionally in the context of a traumatic event.” A younger, less experienced doctor may be more sensitive to a recent trauma, she added, and be more likely to give in to the instinct to avoid. Physicians have learned certain best practices for asking gun-safety questions over time, Stipelman said, so that they don’t come across as intrusive, biased or judgmental. Citing anecdotal evidence, Stipelman said it’s best to frame a gun-related query as “just another safety question” that is asked of everyone, rather than asking if someone has guns in the home without providing the larger safety context. “If you explain why you’re asking — that this is really just about keeping children safe — that’s an issue that most of us can come together over,” she said. But medical school doesn’t prepare doctors-in-training to ask about guns in a non-intrusive way, Stipelman said, nor does it equip them with practical knowledge of gun-locking devices that they could pass along to gun-owning parents. “We need to develop curricula to teach them,” she said. The American Medical Association, which has called gun violence a public-health crisis, offers educational materials for physicians to discuss firearm safety with parents at pediatric visits, patients at risk of suicide and patients experiencing domestic violence. The American Academy of Pediatrics, meanwhile, has sounded the alarm about firearm-related homicides, suicides and unintentional injuries to kids and teens. The organization recommends that pediatricians and other child health-care providers advise parents on “the dangers of allowing children and adolescents to have access to guns inside and outside the home,” including by asking questions about the presence of firearms and by urging gun-owning parents to prevent children’s access to firearms. The AAP last summer also encouraged parents to ask fellow parents, “Is there an unlocked gun in your house?” ahead of children’s play dates. “When guns are in the house, we need to make every effort to keep kids safe. That means locking up guns and keeping ammunition safe and separate from the guns and locked up as well,” AAP spokeswoman Alison Tothy, a Chicago pediatric emergency-medicine doctor, said at the time. “Gun injuries are often fatal. One hundred percent of them are preventable.” ‘He doesn't like where my duplex is located, and he is pushing me to sell it.’",2019-10-30 05:03:42,"Here’s one critical question pediatricians should ask every parent, yet many doctors are reluctant to bring it up  ",,35170,https://www.marketwatch.com/

The shooting took place around 10.44pm, the Long Beach fire department said.  The deadly gunfire broke out at a home where a Halloween party was being held, with people at the home were wearing costumes, according to reports When firefighters and paramedics arrived at the home, they “identified a scene obviously full of chaos”, Jake Heflin, fire department spokesman, said in a video posted to Twitter by a Los Angeles Times reporter. “The scene is obviously still under investigation,” Heflin said.

It is unclear what prompted the shooting, and whether the shooter or shooters knew the victims, KTLA 5 reported. Some locals told the media that they heard nearly 20 shots. After the gunfire, Oswaldo Morales told the LA Times that everything in the vicinity of the party went quiet. “Silence, you didn’t hear a thing,” he said. Squad cars and helicopters rushing to the scene alerted neighbors to the incident. “I was on 4th and Walnut when I heard the gunshots. Some of us in the neighborhood thought it was fireworks, but the racing @LBPD squad cars & low flying helicopters gave the impression that it was more serious. Unfortunately, it was,” local resident Oscar Cancio tweeted. The shooting comes amid ongoing debate on how to combat gun violence that runs rampant in the US. While California has the toughest gun laws of all US states, this week’s incident may mark the third mass shooting in California in 2019, the New York Times reported.

That means locking up guns and keeping ammunition safe and separate from the guns and locked up as well,” AAP spokeswoman Alison Tothy, a Chicago pediatric emergency-medicine doctor, said at the time. “Gun injuries are often fatal. One hundred percent of them are preventable.” 'My husband's parents give money and gifts to his sisters and to their children, but they ignore us.'",2019-10-30 13:19:03,"One critical question pediatricians should ask every parent, yet many don’t  ",,1150,https://www.wsj.com/

AP Photo/Patrick Semansky With less than a week until Virginia’s state elections, the gun control debate has emerged as the leading issue for voters—and national groups on both sides of the issue have taken notice, pouring an unprecedented amount of money into campaigns. Thus far, the National Rifle Association has spent $298,000 on campaign contributions to help ensure the state’s GOP maintains control of its state legislature, according to the nonpartisan politics data group the Virginia Public Access Project. That might not seem like a huge number—especially compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence have spent to boost Democratic candidates—but it’s far more than the NRA has ever spent on in its home state. As the Washington Post reports, the NRA usually spends the bulk of its funds in Virginia through independent expenditures, usually in the form of television ads in support of, or against, a specific candidate. The NRA has so far spent just over $22,000 in independent expenditures this election cycle, which is a lot less than it has in previous years. But since independent expenditures aren’t considered direct campaign contributions, they aren’t tracked in the same way. A majority of the NRA’s direct financial contributions this year have gone to Todd Gilbert, the state’s Republican House majority leader, who represents a district in the Shenandoah Valley and is facing his first general election challenge in 10 years. On September 3, the NRA made a $200,000 donation to Gilbert, the largest single donation the group has ever made to a candidate since at least 1996, the first year VPAP began tracking money in Virginia’s elections. It also donated large sums of money to two long-time incumbent Republican state senators: $50,000 to Mark Obenshain and $25,000 to Ryan McDougle. Elsewhere, the NRA has contributed smaller sums to candidates in tight races, including to Bill DeSteph, the gun-dealing senator representing the district where a shooter killed 12 people in May, and Kirk Cox, the speaker of Virginia’s GOP-controlled House of Delegates who, in July, ended a special session of the state’s general assembly, which had been called specifically to pass gun control, without even holding a vote.  The NRA has long been an influential force in American politics nationally, and that was never more evident than in the 2016 presidential election, when it spent a massive $54.4 million to help elect Donald Trump. But since Trump took office, the group has devolved into chaos thanks to infighting in its leadership, political scandals, and depleted finances. As the fight over gun control has emerged as one of the top issues ahead of the 2020 presidential race, the nation’s leading gun rights groups has never been in worse shape. For many political analysts, Virginia’s off-year state elections are often seen as an early indicator of where the country may be headed politically. “These midterms the year before a presidential election are sometimes seen as a vehicle for gauging support for the president’s party nationally,” says Stephen Farsnworth, a political science professor at Virginia’s University of Mary Washington. “Democrats and Republicans both want national bragging rights for Virginia.” Over the years, the NRA hasn’t traditionally had to spend much in Virginia state elections. In 2017, a year in which Democrats made significant gains in the state’s legislature, the group only spent $31,580 in direct campaign contributions to support Republican candidates—but it reportedly planned to spend up to $750,000 on TV ad buys (VPAP doesn’t have the NRA’s independent expenditure filings listed for 2017) . But as the debate over gun control has evolved since the 2016 presidential election—especially in Virginia, in the wake of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May—the group has ratcheted up its spending like never before. It’s too soon to say if that will also be the case for 2020—so far the NRA has only spent slightly more than $250,000 in next year’s federal elections according to OpenSecrets—but its influence in Virginia’s state elections this year show that it’s at least willing to put up a fight in the battle over gun control.

The department store will open its door at 9 a.m. on Nov. 14, and in the ensuing weeks, construction will commence on a monument set to be anchored on the southern edge of the parking lot. The memorial is estimated to finish construction in late November or early December. It will consist of a 30-foot cylindrical structure ringed by 22 perforated aluminum columns, one for each victim of the tragic shooting in August. The structure, which Walmart intends to name “The Grand Candela,” will also emit a beam of light. “As the store resumes retail operations, we remain focused on honoring the victims and survivors,"" said Todd Peterson, Walmart vice president and regional general manager. “Our goal is to establish a memorial that honors the victims, recognizes the binational relationship between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, and celebrates the strength of the El Paso community.” Extensive reconstruction has also been done to the interior and exterior of the building, which the company plans to showcase at the reopening event. Prior to committing the act, the El Paso gunman posted a racist and xenophobic manifesto online, wherein he expressed fear and hatred toward immigrants, Latinos, and Democratic politicians. El Paso, over 600 miles from the shooter's home in Dallas, is a border town widely known for its significant population of Mexican immigrants. The Walmart logo is seen on a store in Washington, DC, on March 1, 2019.

(Photo by Scott Varley, Daily Breeze/SCNG)  About 20 hours after a gunman opened fire at a Long Beach house party, killing three men and injuring nine more people, about 100 unnerved community members gathered to honor the victims and try to make sense of what happened at a vigil Wednesday evening. Crime-scene tape still marked parts of the quiet Rose Park neighborhood as city officials, neighbors and some who knew the victims gathered at St. Matthews Roman Catholic Church at Seventh Street and Temple Avenue. They stood just a few lots away from where the pandemonium broke loose the night before, at a home near Seventh Street and Ohio Avenue, at around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday. “There is hope,” said Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce, who represents the area. “We will heal together.” A tragedy has happened. Tragedies happen everyday – and last night it happened in the heart of Rose Park. People are dead and wounded. Families and friends are beginning to mourn. It is very early for a path to healing and recovery. But we'll begin. Share condolences. — RPNA (@RoseParkLB) October 30, 2019  The nine suffering from gunshot sounds were in critical-stable to stable condition on Wednesday evening, as police continued to search for the responsible shooter or shooters. Officials have not publicly identified those killed and injured. One suspect, described as a gunman wearing dark-colored clothing with his face concealed, opened fire from an alley at the backyard Halloween house party. But it was too early to tell whether there could’ve been more suspects involved, police spokeswoman Shaunna Dandoy said. While investigators believe the act of violence was an isolated incident, those who live in the relatively quiet residential neighborhood were still concerned. “It’s a different side of the coin for me,” said Rose Park resident and Los Angeles City Fire Department Firefighter/Paramedic Damon Lawrence, 56. “Normally I’m the first responder.” Lawrence said that his wife feels less safe and his neighbors were in shock. “I’ve seen a lot,” the 30-year paramedic said. “It still affects you, especially when it happens this close to home.” Long Beach Vice Mayor Dee Andrews, for his part, said that he was “angry” about the shooting and that others should be, too. He urged anyone with information about the shooting to talk to authorities. Looking forward to Halloween on Thursday, Andrews urged families taking to the streets for trick-or-treating to “walk the streets with no fear.” Religious and community leaders also gave assurance to vigil attendees, including a prayer led by a Buddhist monk that began the vigil. Members of the Cambodian community and others quickly came together after the shooting, according to Pearce. It seemed that many in the community didn’t want this tragic incident to define the neighborhood, but to heal and move forward from it. “If you know this event had some effect on somebody, please reach out,” said Gretchen Swanson of the Rose Park Neighborhood Association. “That is what makes (a) neighborhood.” Get the latest news delivered daily!

The Shoals Dream Center is envisioned as a hub for an array of services to aid the area’s families, The TimesDaily reports. Among them: providing food; academic tutoring and mentoring for at-risk kids. The center also plans to offer addiction recovery resources and life skills training. The Shoals Dream Center is an extension of the Chapel church. The social services components will offer after-school programs where students can engage in learning and developmental training, activities, and games three days per week, says Toyia Gourley, director of the Dream Center Academy. The food distribution is set up in the style of a supermarket, the newspaper reports. Fairbanks: The state agency overseeing air quality has agreed to submit a cleanup plan by mid-December for this city that has some of the nation’s most polluted winter air. A federal court judge, as part of a lawsuit, approved an agreement that set the deadline for the cleanup plan to be submitted by the state Department of Environmental Conservation to the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Judge Thomas Zilly also approved a mid-January deadline for the EPA to make sure the plan complete. Clean air advocates sued in December, saying the state failed to submit a legally compliant plan to address particulate pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and other sources. Fine particulate is a pollutant that can cause heart and lung problems. Tucson: The University of Arizona has announced it is changing its abbreviation from UA to UArizona in an effort to increase search engine optimization results for the college. The Tucson-based college in a statement Monday said the change would help distinguish the school from other national and international entities that use UA, including the University of Alabama, Under Armour and United Airlines. Officials say the southern Arizona school was not appearing high on Google results for “UA.” University officials say the college will now use UArizona for its communications. The college had already changed its Twitter handle to @uarizona. Officials say there are not yet any plans to use the new abbreviation on college merchandise or in chants at sporting events. Jonesboro: An Arkansas State University alumnus says he was surprised to spot a few curious critters running around the campus library. Codie Clark, a math tutor, says he spotted at least two raccoons Sunday on the third floor of the university’s Dean B. Ellis Library while waiting for a student to arrive for a tutoring session. Clark says other students then cornered one raccoon. Associate Vice Chancellor for Marketing and Communications Bill Smith told KAIT-TV that the school’s facility management personnel humanely trapped the animals after being notified by library staff. Clark says an animal rescuer released the racoons back into the wild that night. Smith noted the raccoons likely came to campus because of recent rain. He encouraged anyone who encounters wild animals to contact the Facilities Management Department. Sacramento: Some of the country’s largest ride-sharing companies proposed a state law Tuesday that would let them continue to treat drivers as independent contractors while also guaranteeing them a minimum wage and money for health insurance. The Legislature enacted legislation this year requiring such companies to treat drivers as employees, which would let them form a union and entitle them to benefits. But the law proposed Tuesday would exempt ride-sharing companies. The proposal must be approved by voters. If passed, it would supersede the Legislature’s action and any similar ordinances by local governments. It also would prevent lawmakers from passing another law to block it. The proposal will only get on the November 2020 ballot if supporters can gather about 660,000 signatures. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have already pledged $90 million to support the effort, making it one of the most expensive ballot measures ever. Denver: Hundreds of state employees have prepared to have their emails eliminated to remove access to government records that would otherwise be public. The Denver Post reports the affected employees work for the Department of Regulatory Agencies, which regulates state industries including insurance, banks, electric utilities and real estate. Officials say the department’s 600 employees were notified multiple times of the upcoming purge set to begin Friday. Department officials say employees were instructed to preserve any vital emails, including pending litigation or existing open records requests. Officials say the purge is to ensure department emails are easily searchable. Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition says deletion of electronic records is a major problem for those seeking information. Colorado law gives state departments broad discretion in crafting their record-keeping policies. Waterbury: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed an executive order that creates an entity charged with coming up with a plan for better coordination between state government agencies and the business community. The Democrat says he has a goal of transforming a workforce development system that’s currently designed to meet the needs of 20th-century jobs into one that serves 21st-century jobs. He says the state’s education and training system today is “too static and disconnected,” and there’s a need for better collaboration with business and labor so Connecticut’s teachers know what skills to teach. Lamont announced the creation of the Governor’s Workforce Council at Naugatuck Community College on Tuesday. Dover: A federal magistrate is recommending dismissal of a lawsuit against Delaware State University officials by a woman who says she was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. The magistrate ruled Tuesday that the revised lawsuit by Mai-Ajah Keel is time-barred and that Keel has failed to state a claim. Keel says after she reported the assault in 2013, she was met with deliberate indifference by school officials and harassment and retaliation by her alleged attacker and other students. Keel’s alleged attacker, Jason Faustin, was charged in 2015 with fourth-degree rape. The charges were later dropped, but Faustin was suspended from campus after a school panel found him “responsible” for sexual assault. Faustin later served as an intern in the Dover office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Chris Coons. Washington: There was glam; there were costumes; there were high heels and a race. In a D.C. tradition that has made a statement since the 1980s, the 33rd Annual 17th Street High Heel Race took off Tuesday evening with a parade and race near Dupont Circle, WUSA-TV reports. The event is the district’s second-largest annual LGBTQ community event, filled with cheer as costumed drag queens and other participants race down the street. It was originally started by a group of 25 drag queens who decided to sprint down the road and strut their stuff. This year, the event brought out thousands of residents and visitors to join in on the fun. Even Mayor Muriel Bowser made an appearance at the event, serving as the grand marshal to kick off the celebration. Orlando: A memorial for the Pulse nightclub massacre will have a reflecting pool with rainbow-colored lines radiating from it, and a nearby museum will resemble a three-dimensional spirograph, according to design concepts announced Wednesday. Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed. Atlanta: Officials are moving forward with plans for some new parks in the city. The Atlanta-Journal Constitution reports that the City Council last week approved the purchase of land from The Conservation Fund for a park in the Home Park neighborhood. The city will buy the land for a little more than $200,000. City officials also approved funding to purchase two properties for the $40 million Rodney Cook Sr. Park currently under construction in the Vine City neighborhood. The AJC says the park will feature 18 sculptures memorializing civil rights heroes, including Martin Luther King Jr. Hilo: The Big Island neighborhood that was ravaged by the 2018 Kilauea volcano eruption has become a destination for tourists wanting to get a look at the damage caused by one of the largest eruptions in the volcano’s recent history. But the Hawaii Tribune Herald reports residents of the Leilani Estates neighborhood consider the visitors a nuisance and are relieved to see interest beginning to wane. Tourism increased as residents were trying to return to their homes and property after being forced to evacuate. More than 700 homes were destroyed. Leilani Estates Community Association president Andy Andrews says the number of tourists has fallen significantly since earlier this year, and there are fewer confrontations between locals and visitors, who he says ignore warning signs and parking rules. Boise: Latino students make up 18% of the enrollment in the state’s public schools, but their achievement scores continue to lag state averages. The Idaho Statesman reports researchers and state officials say improving Latino students’ outcomes is an urgent need because of their importance to the state’s workforce. The Idaho Department of Education has set long-term goals to improve Latino outcomes. However, the department has left strategy for reaching those goals to districts and schools with little success in two years. Latino students are recording lower-than-average test scores and fewer postsecondary degrees. Rod Gramer, the CEO of Idaho Business for education, says if the Latino students are not successful, Idaho is not going to be successful. Chicago: The city’s teachers union voted to approve a tentative contract agreement with city officials Wednesday but refused to end a strike that has canceled two weeks of classes unless the mayor adds school days to cover that lost time. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Wednesday night that she would not meet that demand. Lightfoot accused the union’s top leadership of “moving the goal posts” by raising the issue Wednesday rather than in a face-to-face meeting with her Tuesday. “Not once during that three-and-a-half-hour meeting did they raise compensation for strike days,” Lightfoot said heatedly. Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said it would require cutting winter or spring break days or adding days to the end of the year. Union President Jesse Sharkey said the teachers are not asking to be paid for a strike but do credit the walkout for forcing the district to compromise on some contract issues. Seymour: John Mellencamp, the subject of a new mural in his hometown, endorsed the project by adding a few significant brushstrokes Tuesday afternoon. Indiana rock star Mellencamp painted his initials, “JJM,” on the exterior of a music store in Seymour, the community he immortalized in 1985 hit “Small Town.” Artist Pamela Bliss says Mellencamp was reserved and appreciative during his surprise visit, but he also flashed his signature ornery demeanor when Bliss offered a small paintbrush after he agreed to sign the work. “He said, ‘You call that a (expletive) brush? Give me another one,’ ” Bliss said, laughing. “I got a little piece of the real John right there.” Bliss says she’s a fan of Mellencamp’s paintings, some of which are currently on display at the Southern Indiana Center for the Arts in Seymour and at ACA Galleries in New York City. Waukee: Authorities are investigating another explosion at a gender reveal party that happened one day after a blast at a similar gathering killed a 56-year-old woman in a nearby community. Authorities say no one was injured in the explosion Sunday in rural Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, but they are looking into unconfirmed claims that the blast broke a neighbor’s windows. Waukee Fire Capt. Tomme Tysdal says the Waukee explosion came from a commercially available gender reveal kit, unlike the homemade device that killed Pamela Kreimeyer on Saturday near Knoxville, a town 45 miles away. Authorities say Kreimeyer died instantly when her family’s device exploded, hitting her in the head from 45 feet away. Dodge City: A monkey that was injured last month trying to protect his offspring from being taken by an intruder during an apparent break-in at a zoo has died. Officials at the Wright Park Zoo say the 32-year-old tufted capuchin monkey was found unresponsive early Tuesday. City spokeswoman Abbey Martin says the zoo’s veterinarian was unable to revive the monkey, named Vern. The Hutchinson News reports a necropsy will be done to determine the cause of death. Vern underwent surgery for broken bones after the Sept. 3 break-in. A younger monkey named Pickett was found loose within the city limits and returned to the zoo. Vern and a female monkey named Charro arrived at the zoo in 1988. Their two youngest sons, Jack and Pickett, are part of the zoo’s current capuchin troop. Murray: Murray State University students are using GPS devices to track box turtles and learn about the technology’s value. Assistant wildlife biology professor Andrea Darracq says students work in the classroom to build the tracking devices and go into the field at an off-campus university property to locate the turtles. The university says the turtles are tracked with the GPS devices and a transmitter, allowing the students to determine a turtle’s location with a receiver and compare it to more precise GPS readings. The school says the capturing and marking of turtles was done with approval from its Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee and a state educational wildlife collection permit. New Orleans: A $2.1 million research project at Tulane University is aimed at helping members of an American Indian tribe cope with climate change and economic inequality. In a news release, Tulane says the project aims to benefit the United Houma Nation. Challenges facing the south Louisiana tribe include coastal land loss that threatens fishing, trapping and even some homes. Part of the project will involve examining how tribal citizens move within and outside the state to manage these and other challenges. Tulane’s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine was awarded the project by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine’s Gulf Research Program. Gardiner: It looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and – if it gets a prosthetic leg – will once again walk like a duck. Loni Hamner, of Gardiner, recently adopted a female Mallard duck that was left with one leg and a stump after being attacked by a fox last year. Hamner says the duck she’s named Faith can hop and hobble around, but she wants her “to have a good duck quality of life and do all the things ducks like to do.” The Bangor Daily News reports that a query on the Maine Poultry Connection Facebook page led Hamner to the University of Maine Advanced Structure and Composites Center. Lab manager Paul Bussiere says he’ll create a prosthetic leg for Faith for free in his spare time. Annapolis: Exelon Corp., the energy company that runs the Conowingo Dam, will invest more than $200 million in environmental projects, according to an agreement announced Tuesday by Gov. Larry Hogan. Officials have been focusing on how to address the environmental impact of trash and debris that has been swept downstream from Pennsylvania to Maryland through the dam after heavy rains. State officials also are concerned that sediment buildup behind the dam’s walls could be released and wreak havoc on the fragile Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The money in the proposed settlement will be used to improve water quality in the Lower Susquehanna River and the Chesapeake Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, Hogan said. Parts of the agreement will be submitted for approval to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as part of the licensing renewal for the dam. Carver: The cranberry industry is looking to solar power for relief as it struggles with plummeting fruit prices. Cranberry farmers in Massachusetts, the nation’s second-largest grower after Wisconsin, are proposing to build solar panels above their bogs. Jordan Macknick, an analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, says the novel approach to blending solar production with crop cultivation is being researched but hasn’t been tried before on a large scale anywhere in the world. Michael Wainio, a Massachusetts cranberry farmer proposing one of the projects, says revenue from solar power is essential to maintaining his family’s farm near Cape Cod. University of Massachusetts researchers have launched a study to examine the idea. Opponents argue there would be long-term environmental consequences. Detroit: The funeral for John Conyers, who served more than 50 years in Congress, will be held Monday at a church in the city. The public will get a chance to show their respect for Conyers on Saturday and Sunday at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. Conyers died Sunday at age 90, two years after resigning from the U.S. House. Monica Conyers tells The Detroit News that her husband’s funeral will be held at Greater Grace Temple. She anticipates former President Bill Clinton will attend, along with elected officials. On Twitter, Clinton called Conyers a “champion for justice & equality.” Conyers was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and is credited with creating the federal holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Minneapolis: Data show that the University of Minnesota’s 2019 freshmen class is the biggest in 50 years and includes the most students of color in the school’s history. The Minnesota Daily reports the Office of Institutional Research’s numbers reveal that most freshmen – about 54% – are female. In 2010, 18% of the freshman class was students of color. Now, minority students make up more than a quarter of this year’s class. Vice provost and dean of the school’s Office of Undergraduate Education Bob McMaster says part of the rise is due to changes in Minnesota high schools, which have seen demographic shifts in recent years. Still, the number of black students remains relatively small. About 5% of new students are black, up slightly from over 4% a decade ago. Jackson: With the nationwide closure of Fred’s Pharmacy, one county is taking it really hard. The residents of Kemper County in east-central Mississippi now find themselves without any pharmacy in the entire county. Residents will have to place and pick up prescriptions at pharmacies in Meridian or Philadelphia – about a 30-minute drive to each one. Mississippi Board of Pharmacy President Ryan Harper says that will be an issue for some of the state’s most critical patients. He says patients on multiple prescriptions also usually have a huge hurdle of having access to reliable transportation. Fred’s closed Oct. 18. It was located in the county seat, Dekalb, with a population of just over 1,000 residents. Kansas City: The mayor is proposing an ordinance aimed at helping police keep firearms away from those with a history of domestic violence. The Kansas Star reports that the ordinance Quinton Lucas unveiled Wednesday would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists, but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases. Lucas and his staff wrote the proposal with help from the Rose Brooks Center, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Shelter victim advocate Annie Struby says more than half of the most dangerous domestic abusers in Kansas City have access to firearms. Helena: The state has spent more than $2 million on snow plowing so far this year, surpassing what costs were by this date for the past two years. The Independent Record reports snow plowing costs for the state Department of Transportation increased by more than 250% since last year. Department officials say they spent $575,577 from July 1 to Oct. 28 last year and $544,872 during the same period in 2017. Officials say record snowstorms have hit large regions just days into the fall season, breaking decades­long snowfall records in cities like Great Falls. Officials say about 277,800 miles have been plowed so far this season. Only a quarter of that was plowed this time last year. Officials say costs include labor, operating equipment and materials. North Platte: Officials have begun the process to get the city’s downtown placed on the National Register of Historic Places. City officials convened an open house Monday to review the federal and state historic-district guidelines with members of an Omaha planning firm and the Nebraska State Historic Preservation Office. Omaha-based RDG will prepare North Platte’s nomination papers. Stephanie Rose, an urban planner for the firm, says residents are welcome to share their thoughts and historic information with her over the coming months. If the U.S. National Park Service adds downtown North Platte to the register, buildings that are at least 50 years old within the district could qualify for federal and state historic tax credits to help pay for rehabilitation projects. Las Vegas: The state’s casinos took in nearly $1.06 billion in winnings last month – a high for 2019 and a record for September in a key index of state fiscal health. Nevada Gaming Control Board analyst Michael Lawton attributes Wednesday’s healthy “gaming win” report to an increase in slot machine play and results from Las Vegas Strip and Clark County casinos. Lawton says a 6.8% increase in the monthly figure compared with the same month a year ago was the fourth straight increase in the year-to-year comparison. The state took in almost $66.4 million in taxes on the September 2019 figures. The $1.059 billion tally topped the previous September best of $1.058 billion in 2007 by just $100,000. October 2007 was the best month ever for casino winnings, at $1.165 billion. Durham: The University System of New Hampshire has announced that tuition for in-state students will be frozen in place for the 2020-2021 academic year. The Concord Monitor reports that the state board of trustees announced Tuesday that it had unanimously voted to freeze tuition for undergraduate students. The freeze will go into effect for students at the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College and Granite State College. The New Hampshire House recently increased the state’s appropriation to the university system by $12 million over two years to freeze tuition. Gov. Chris Sununu called the announcement a “big win for New Hampshire students.” This is the system’s first tuition freeze since 2013. Woodbridge: A small plane crashed through the roof of a home Tuesday, killing the pilot and causing an explosion that set two houses ablaze in a New Jersey suburb of New York City. No one was in the home in which the Cessna 414 crashed, but flames spread to another house, where a woman escaped injury, Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac said. The plane went down about 11 a.m. not far from an elementary school, according to National Transportation Safety Board investigator Adam Gerhardt. The crash sent flames into the air, belched smoke for hours and left neighbors thinking the earth was shaking. Gerhardt said the pilot was flying using instrument flight rules typically used by experienced pilots when flying with reduced visibility. The weather in the area was cloudy and misty at the time of the crash. Albuquerque: The U.S. House has approved legislation that would prohibit oil and gas development on federal land surrounding a national park held sacred by numerous Native American tribes. The vote came Wednesday to make permanent a buffer around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico says there are some areas where drilling should not take place, and the area around Chaco is one of them. Aside from prohibiting new permits and canceling any existing nonproducing leases, the measure suggests additional studies and protective measures should be taken to address health, safety and environmental effects on nearby communities and tribal interests. The area includes land belonging to the Navajo Nation and individual tribal members. The legislation does not affect those parcels. New York: City lawmakers on Wednesday passed a bill that bans restaurants and grocery stores from selling foie gras, the fattened liver of a duck or goose, considered a culinary delicacy for centuries. The bill, expected to be signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, would forbid the sale of the French specialty starting in 2022. Animal welfare activists had campaigned for a ban on the grounds that the methods used to produce foie gras are cruel, involving force-feeding a bird a corn-based mixture through a tube slipped down its throat. Farmers who produce foie gras – meaning fatty liver in French – say the birds are treated humanely and don’t suffer during the fattening process. The council vote was 42-6 for the final version of the bill that calls for a fine of up to $2,000 for each violation. With about 1,000 New York restaurants offering foie gras, top chefs did not take kindly to the news, including Momofuku’s David Chang, who called it “idiocracy.” Spencer: The state has received a federal grant to renovate a 1920s rail car that was built to comply with the racist Jim Crow laws of the 20th century. State officials say the National Park Service awarded a grant of more than $287,000 to renovate the railroad car that’s now at the N.C. Transportation Museum in Spencer. The 44-seat coach hasn’t been used since 1969. The car has 22 seats in the rear that were designated for African Americans so that it complied with segregation laws. It needs extensive renovation, including asbestos removal. The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources says it’s one of few such cars held by a museum for public viewing. Another one is at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Bismarck: The state auditor is retracting an audit critical of the city of Williston after officials provided more information to the state. Auditor Josh Gallion issued the audit report Monday but retracted it late Tuesday. Gallion says the audit “highlighted several areas of concern,” including a violation of the state’s open meetings law and $92 million in airport contracts that were not disclosed in financial statements. Gallion says the city auditor signed off on the report last week. But Gallion says the city has now provided more information for review. Gallion says auditors are reviewing the new information and will issue a revised audit later. Cleveland: A federal civil rights lawsuit says a 10-year-old Muslim boy was questioned about his patriotism and religious beliefs by a student teacher at a school outside Cleveland and was ordered to undress to determine whether his parents had abused him. The lawsuit filed last week says the boy’s teacher, the student teacher and a nurse for the Lakeview Local School District in Cortland held him against his will in a room last November and coerced him into saying he’d been disciplined by his mother with a belt. Family attorney Matthew Abens says a county children’s services investigation quickly determined there was no wrongdoing by his parents. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says the boy is being treated for trauma. Oklahoma City: Health officials say the frequency of congenital syphilis cases has risen sharply in the state during the past five years and continues to increase. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Tuesday that the state has experienced a 283% increase in the number of congenital syphilis cases among women since 2014 and a 92% increase since last year. Adults transmit syphilis through sexual contact, but health officials say congenital syphilis can be transmitted by an infected mother to her baby in the womb or through the birthing process. The disease can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, birth defects and death. Officials say health care providers should test pregnant women for the disease early in their pregnancy and again early in the third trimester. Salem: The number of wolves in the state is growing, but not particularly fast. State biologists tallied a minimum of 124 wolves statewide last year, according to the annual wolf report released Wednesday. The number represented an 11% increase over the previous year, but only a growth of 14 animals since 2015. Four wolves were killed illegally in 2017, and another five were killed due to conflict with livestock. Wolves continued to expand their territory. A pair of resident wolves were documented in the Mount Hood area for the first time, meaning the apex predator has a foothold in every region of the state except the coast. Oregon is home to at least 12 wolf packs, according to the report, including 11 that have a breeding male and female with at least two pups that survived the winter. Bethlehem: A prosecutor says he will recommend dismissal of charges against a woman authorities say handed her 1-month-old baby to a bus driver and walked away in tears. Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Wednesday that 26-year-old Ashley Walters “clearly has some mental health issues.” He said she had displayed combative and erratic behavior and would be involuntarily committed for treatment. Walters was charged with child endangerment after authorities said she boarded a bus in Bethlehem, placed her son on the farebox and told the driver to call police because “this was her son that she can’t take care of.” Pennsylvania’s Safe Haven Law allows babies up to 28 days old to be left at a hospital or police station. Morganelli says Walters’ baby was 32 days old. Providence: The city has come up with what it calls a “climate justice plan” to reduce its carbon footprint while accounting for the needs of low-income and minority neighborhoods. The plan unveiled Friday by the city’s Office of Sustainability and Racial and Environmental Justice Committee includes getting 100% of municipal buildings’ electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and making all city vehicles and school buses run on renewable energy by 2040. Priorities outlined in the 88-page plan include planting more trees and expanding green spaces; investing in bike paths, trails and sidewalk improvements; and eliminating food waste. The plan says neighborhoods with the largest populations of people of color and lowest median incomes have the most pollution, the severe health effects from environmental causes, and the least amount of green space. Charleston: Environmental groups are taking steps toward suing a company they say is responsible for polluting the state’s waters with tiny plastic beads. News outlets report the groups represented by Southern Environmental Law Center sent Frontier Logistics a 60-day legal notice Monday on grounds it violated the Clean Water Act. The state environmental control department cited Frontier in July after the plastic bits, called nurdles, were found in its facility and thought to be the same ones spilled onto Sullivan’s Island. Environmental groups say they’re still washing up. But Frontier’s vice president contends the nurdles can’t be traced to it. An environmental control spokeswoman said Frontier installed preventative measures, so the agency closed the matter. The pellets are turned into plastic products, and environmentalists say marine animals mistake them for food. Sioux Falls: University leaders tell state lawmakers they’re working to implement a new law aimed at ensuring free speech and intellectual diversity on campus. A legislative committee summoned regents and university presidents to a meeting Wednesday to detail their efforts to comply with the law. Its passage last spring came after controversy over a “Hawaiian Day” party theme at the University of South Dakota revived conservative lawmakers’ complaints about political correctness on campus. The university presidents said they’re holding trainings for students and faculty on protecting speech. They say they’re also working to gauge students’ experiences on campus. The Board of Regents is required to give a written report on its implementation of the law by Dec. 1. Cleveland: You’ve heard of a pumpkin being turned into a carriage, but what about into a boat? Justin Ownby has tried for years to grow the perfect giant pumpkin, with limited success. This year, though, he outdid himself. “We’ve pumpkin spiced everything else; why not pumpkin spice a boat?” he said. Ownby, 36, owns a family farm in Cleveland with his wife, Christin, 32, and their four children. A massive pumpkin in his patch grew to more than 900 pounds and several feet across this year, big enough to carve out space for a grown man to sit inside it and paddle across a pond – before it sank under him. “It’s fish food now,” Ownby said with a laugh. “There’s catfish in there. They’ll make short work of that thing.” Harlingen: The critically endangered Kemp’s ridley sea turtle had an offseason for nesting this year along beaches in the state, with 190 nests recorded in Texas. The Valley Morning Star reports the number, which covers a geographic area from the Bolivar Peninsula south to Boca Chica beach, was down from 250 nests logged last year and 353 in 2017. But this year’s sharp drop-off in Kemp’s ridley nesting in Mexico has set off yellow-flag alerts among scientists who track and study the species. The Texas nesting numbers were not necessarily poor by the standards of the past decade, and they tend to fluctuate because adult females don’t return to their home beach every year to lay a clutch of eggs. Recent studies show female Kemp’s ridleys may come back to nest at three-plus-year intervals. Salt Lake City: A state liquor commission has announced it is running out of bar licenses for potential business owners again after a similar shortage two years ago. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control handed out its last 2019 bar permits Tuesday to two establishments in Lehi and West Valley City. Department authorities say five other business were placed on the waiting list, some of them planning to open in November and December. Officials say businesses must wait for a population increase after applying due to a state law allowing one bar for every 10,200 people. Officials say three permits are expected before July 2020 following new population information. Some owners say the Legislature should review the population quota. Montpelier: The state has named a new poet laureate. Republican Gov. Phil Scott appointed Mary Ruefle to the honorary position this week. WCAX-TV reports she was recommended by a panel of judges. The poet laureate is picked every four years and serves as the state’s ambassador for the art of poetry, participating in ceremonies and readings in Vermont and nationwide. Ruefle said at the ceremony Monday that she was honored to join the ranks of those who served before her and was humbled and scared. She said she’s used to that and said that’s how she feels in the face of poetry and as “a member of that tribe.” Chard Deniord was the state’s last poet laureate. Robert Frost served as Vermont’s first in 1961. Richmond: Democrats hoping to seize control of the Legislature in next month’s elections say passing the long-stalled Equal Rights Amendment will be a top priority next year. Passed by Congress in 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, explicitly enshrining equality for women in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty-seven states have ratified it, and advocates say having 38 would meet the constitutional threshold for approval, though it would also likely spark court battles over a long-passed ratification deadline and other legal questions. Other states are working toward ratification, but advocates say the once solidly conservative Virginia, where every seat is on the ballot in November, appears closest. The measure has cleared Virginia’s GOP-controlled Senate before but stalled in the House, which Republicans also narrowly control. Yakima: County officials have announced a proposal to turn a jail into a homeless shelter and use an additional sales tax for funding. The Yakima Herald-Republic reports the proposal would convert the 288-bed jail into a multi-care facility named the Yakima County Care Campus. Yakima County commissioners say the 0.3% countywide sales tax that generates more than $3.5 million a year could fund the care facility with commissioner approval. Officials say commissioners are expected to hold a city hall meeting Oct. 29 to decide. Commissioners say the facility would offer mental health services, substance abuse treatment and long-term housing. Officials say an 8,000-square-foot storage building on the jail’s property would be used as permanent shelter. Commissioners expect to fully convert the facility by 2026. Richwood: An 11-foot python that was on the loose was found Tuesday, about a month after it got out of its tank, broke through a window screen and slithered outside. Richwood Police Chief Charles Burkhamer says a letter carrier saw the snake laying out in the sun next to a roadway Tuesday, about a block away from where it escaped a month ago. Authorities had been scouring the area trying to find the reptile, and Richwood residents had been notified to keep watch over small children and house pets. Burkhamer said he faced a practical question as he looked at the massive snake on the side of the road. “What am I going to do with it?” he wondered. “We didn’t have a dog crate big enough.” So Burkhamer stuck the snake in a trash can for safekeeping until it could be returned to its owner, who has been asked to register the animal with state officials and reinforce the reptile’s tank. Madison: The state has the widest achievement gap between black and white students of any state based on results of a test known as the nation’s report card. The National Assessment of Educational Progress test results released Wednesday show no significant change from statewide results a decade ago. However, declining scores for the lowest-performing students resulted in Wisconsin having the widest achievement gap of any state. State superintendent of schools Carolyn Stanford Taylor says the achievement gap is a crisis, and closing the gaps is “imperative for our state.” The test was given to students in fourth and eighth grades last spring. Wisconsin’s scores were higher than the national averages in both grades and in both subjects. Cody: Farmers in the state are wrapping up a difficult year for sugar beets. A cold snap followed by a week of mild temperatures is threatening the harvest in the Bighorn Basin. A freeze followed by a thaw causes liquids to run out and spoil other beets when they’re stacked in piles. It also lowers the sugar content and price for beets. The Cody Enterprise reports a summer hailstorm and rainy weather also made for a difficult year. Farmer Cody Easum says harvest size and sugar content are both low this year. A local beet pile is growing by about 1,200 tons per day, down from 3,000-4,000 tons in a typical year.

13,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/10/virginia-house-election-2019-kirk-cox-shelia-bynum-coleman/,"Sheila Bynum-Coleman, the Democratic candidate running against Virginia House Speaker Kirk Cox, speaks at a news conference hosted by the Human Rights Campaign on August 15, 2019.Steve Ruark/AP Images for HRC Sheila Bynum-Coleman is nervous and running late. It’s just before 5 p.m. on a sticky summer evening late in August when we pull up in front of her modest suburban house in Chesterfield, Virginia. “I need a few minutes!” Bynum-Coleman tells Rob Silverstein, her 28-year-old campaign manager, when he calls to say we’re outside. He turns to me after hanging up. “It’s okay to be a little late to your own fundraiser,” he says. “Make an entrance.” A month earlier, Bynum-Coleman, 47, made her entrance into the political spotlight when national political groups jumped into Virginia’s upcoming statehouse elections with a slew of endorsements and millions of dollars in campaign contributions, including more than $250,000 to her campaign. State elections aren’t usually thrust into the national political conversation—especially in an off-year election when there are no presidential or congressional races—but the upcoming ones in Virginia carry a lot of added weight: If Democrats win control of the state’s legislature, it would be the first time the party controlled the full government since 1993. What voters decide in November won’t just shape the state’s political future for the next decade, but could give the country a hint as to what might happen in the 2020 presidential election. Because of the timing and political history of Virginia’s state elections, analysts often see the state as a political indicator for where the country might go next. And in the wake of several mass shootings this year, the debate over gun control has become a leading issue for voters nationwide and reshaped the political implications of many national and local campaigns. That’s especially true in Virginia, where a shooter entered a municipal building in Virginia Beach in May and killed 12 people. And at the center of it all is Bynum-Coleman, a real estate agent, developer, and mother of five who has made gun control a central message in her campaign against the most powerful Republican in the state, Kirk Cox. As speaker of the GOP-controlled House, the 62-year-old Cox, who has represented Virginia’s 66th District since 1990, has thwarted Virginia Democrats’ push to pass several pieces of progressive legislation—even ones with bipartisan support. He’s kept the state’s Equal Rights Amendment in legislative purgatory, blocked measures to ban housing and workplace discrimination for LGBTQ residents, and opposed raising the state’s minimum wage. And in a move that reinforced Bynum-Coleman’s decision to run against him, he prevented gun control legislation from passing. Strengthening gun control laws has long been an uphill climb for Virginia Democrats. The state is home to the National Rifle Association, whose vast financial influence in American politics was on full display during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Historically, the NRA hasn’t had to flex its political muscle much in the Old Dominion state, but that all changed after the Virginia Beach shooting. A month after the shooting, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam convened a special session to pass gun control legislation, but the session lasted all of 90 minutes after the Republican majority of the Assembly—with Cox at the helm—voted to adjourn the session without passing any gun control measures. All day long, the NRA was there, posted up inside Cox’s office. But now Cox’s reign is under threat. Not just by Bynum-Coleman’s ability to attract more national support than a typical state-level campaign—she’s raised more than a million dollars (though trails Cox’s haul of $1.5 million) and received endorsements from organizations like Moms Demand Action, Brady United Against Gun Violence, the Human Rights Campaign, and EMILY’s List—but because the state’s previous legislative boundaries were tossed out by federal courts due to racial gerrymandering, a decision recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. For Cox’s district, that’s meant a big shift of voters from predominantly white and Republican Richmond suburbs to the more racially and politically diverse communities of Wilkinson Terrace, Matoaca, and Bynum-Coleman’s community of Chesterfield. Using data from the US Census Bureau and the Virginia Division of Legislative Services, the Virginia Public Access Project—a nonpartisan data organization dedicated to Virginia politics—predicts a 32-point shift in Cox’s district, pushing it to 53.2 percent Democratic voters and 46.8 percent Republican. It is one of six GOP districts that have been redrawn to benefit Democrats, threatening to erase the GOP’s three-seat majority in the House. Cox is feeling the heat: For the first time in decades, he took to the debate stage to convince voters that he should stay in office. “We have gotten to where we are in Virginia, I think, because of very balanced, sound policies,” Cox said during the debate, where he avoided directly answering questions about gun control legislation and climate change. “It’s the Republican majority that’s trying to keep those.” The aspiration among the state’s well-heeled Democrats to undo that majority was palpable and optimistic at Bynum-Coleman’s August fundraiser, which she eventually arrived at as stragglers were rushing to check in. The venue, in a posh clubhouse in a neighboring district, was packed with dozens of Democratic fundraisers eager to mingle with their party’s new rising star. Bynum-Coleman represents the new face of the state’s resurgent Democratic Party—a young black woman who entered the political arena because she was fed up by a lack of progress she was seeing in her community. “I’m running against the most powerful Republican in the state of Virginia, and this election is going to impact people’s lives,” Bynum-Coleman said with calm confidence. “There’s some nights I can’t sleep. When I knock on people’s doors and they tell me they need me to win, that’s not something I take lightly. That’s big to me.” The push to strengthen Virginia’s gun control laws is at the center of the state’s shifting political identity, and there’s a lot of hope that these legislative elections will reflect that. According to a recent Washington Post–Schar School poll, gun policy is the top issue for Virginia voters. Other statewide polls show strong bipartisan support for passing gun control measures, including universal background checks, limits on concealed carry, and a ban on assault-style weapons. A poll last year found that 54 percent of voters thought it was more important to control who can buy guns than to protect the rights of gun owners. “The politics of guns in Virginia is a powerful example of how the state’s political culture has changed very rapidly,” says Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia. For decades, he says, Democrats wouldn’t talk about gun control outside of the bluest urban districts because of NRA’s political influence in the state. But support for gun control has slowly increased in the state since the mass shooting on the campus of Virginia Tech in April 2007 and intensified greatly in the wake of the Virginia Beach shooting. “If the public is moving in a certain direction, you as a politician would be unwise to ignore it,” Farnsworth says. For Bynum-Coleman, the gun control push is personal. In 2016, her daughter was shot at a party when an argument between two people led to an exchange of gunfire. She survived and made a full recovery, but the experience seriously shook Bynum-Coleman. “Just imagine getting a call in the middle of the night that your child has been shot,” she says with shaky breath when I ask her about the incident. “It was a very traumatic experience.” Earlier, her cousin was shot 23 times in two separate incidents. “Just seeing the gun violence in my community, it’s always been a concern,” she says. “Never knew what I could personally do about it—I just wanted to see something change.” It’s no coincidence that the NRA set up shop in Virginia in 1993. For decades, the state has been home to some of the loosest gun control laws in the country. That was especially true before 1993, when the state passed a law limiting the number of handguns an individual could purchase in a month. “People would come to Virginia,” Randy Rollins, the former secretary of public safety under Gov. Doug Wilder, told Virginia Public Media earlier this summer. “They could go to a gun dealer. Buy 25, 30 weapons, put them in the back of their car, take them to DC.” That law was repealed in 2012 by the state’s GOP-controlled legislature and Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican who had voted to approve the original law when he was a member of the state’s House in the ’90s. In recent years, the GOP-led legislature in Virginia, with Cox at the helm, has used its narrow majority to thwart any gun control legislation. In the aftermath of the Virginia Beach shooting, Cox and his fellow Republicans pulled a Mitch McConnell at the special session and refused to vote on any of the gun control bills introduced by both Democrats and Republicans, ending the proceedings after just 90 minutes. Outside the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond on the morning of the session, Bynum-Coleman joined hundreds of gun control activists demonstrating outside. She was energized by the size of the crowd gathered in the sweltering July heat to demand gun control laws, which far outnumbered the pro-gun contingent, she recalls. But inside the Capitol, a conference room in Cox’s office turned into a de facto war room for NRA officials, who strategized about counter-protest efforts and distributed hundreds of t-shirts and hats to pro-gun demonstrators. Virginia Democrats were stunned by Cox’s move to end the session after just 90 minutes, but the NRA had spent weeks guiding the GOP leadership on how to handle the session, the Washington Post reported. Virginia voters may want tight gun control laws, but the NRA’s grip on the state’s GOP leadership is tighter. So far this election cycle, the NRA—amid its myriad financial struggles and internal turmoil—has spent $273,000 to help state Republicans stay in control, according to VPAP, much more than it has in any previous state election cycle. The issue of gun control isn’t just a leading concern for the Virginia state elections, but for the upcoming 2020 presidential election, and many national political groups are looking at Virginia as a bellwether. To that effect, national gun control groups have spent a historic amount of money in Virginia. Everytown for Gun Safety has pumped $2.5 million into the state’s 2019 elections, while Giffords, the gun violence prevention research and advocacy group co-founded by former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, just launched a $300,000 digital ad campaign to help its endorsed candidates—including Bynum-Coleman—get elected. Cox, through his political action committee, has received $1,500 from the NRA thus far. Cox and his GOP colleagues’ control of the Virginia legislature was by design. The oldest legislative body in the Western Hemisphere has ping-ponged back and forth between the two parties for decades, but for the past 20 years, the GOP has controlled its House of Delegates. The state went for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election by more than 5 points, but in the 2017 midterms, Republicans barely held onto the House because of a race that was so close the winner’s name was literally drawn out of a hat. Democrats in the state had a banner year in 2017, but they probably would have gained more seats had it not been for the gerrymandered maps that Republicans passed in 2011. Though Democrats won the statewide vote for the Assembly by 9 points in 2017, Republicans narrowly maintained control of the body because of district lines that packed majority-black parts of Richmond and Hampton Roads into overwhelmingly Democratic districts. But in 2018, after a years-long court battle, a federal court ruled that the Assembly map was unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered and ordered that 11 districts be redrawn, including Cox’s district. Cox didn’t take the ruling lightly. “The modules selected by the Court target senior Republicans, myself included, without a substantive basis in the law,” he said at the time. “We are confident that the Supreme Court will not allow the remedial map the court appears to be on its way to adopting to stand.” It did, in a 5–4 ruling. And so, as the Virginia heads into the next redistricting cycle in 2021, the future of Virginia’s legislative maps—and the state’s politics—for the next decade lies in how well the Democratic candidates in those redrawn districts fare on November 5. With gun control at the center of the political debate, Virginia’s elections have come to be seen as a sort of referendum ahead of 2020, and it has drawn outsize attention. Progressive political groups continue to funnel millions of dollars to Democratic candidates in tight races, and celebrities like Alec Baldwin, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Debra Messing, and Mark Ruffalo have endorsed candidates in swing districts. And Bynum-Coleman has made the issue central to her campaign. In late September, Everytown produced a television ad for Bynum-Coleman that pulled no punches in criticizing Cox’s relationship with the NRA: “Kirk Cox cares more about the gun lobby than our families.” That’s the message she’s been repeating on the fundraising circuit, where people always introduced her with some version of “the future of the Virginia Democratic Party.” At several fundraisers I attended—near her home district in Virginia and in Washington, DC—she told the same stories. How her son with a learning disability struggled to get resources at school, prompting her first run for the state House in 2015. The myriad challenges she’s faced as a black woman. But the one that always elicited dead silence and solemn stares is when she recalls the horror of getting a phone call in the middle of the night that her child has been shot. And then she would follow up the story with the same talking points about how important it is for Virginia to pass stronger gun control laws and how shameful it was that her opponent punted on doing so. And every time she brought it up, her audiences sternly shook their heads in agreement. Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed. The museum will have open-air areas, a vertical garden, public plazas and a rooftop promenade, according to the design concepts. A committee of Pulse survivors, architects and central Florida leaders picked the concepts following a public viewing of six finalists' proposals. Members of the public left 2,300 comments about the six finalists, which had been whittled down from 68 submissions. The memorial will be at the site of the former nightclub and the museum will be a third of a mile away. Both are slated to open in 2022.

15,https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/new-zealand-bans-video-game-that-seems-to-glorify-mass-shooting/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Tech By Reuters Submit October 31, 2019 | 10:43am WELLINGTON – New Zealand’s Chief Censor said on Thursday he had banned a video game that appeared to glorify the mass shooting in Christchurch earlier this year that killed 51 Muslim worshippers. In an attack broadcast live on Facebook, a lone gunman armed with semi-automatic weapons targeted Muslims attending prayers in two Christchurch mosques on March 15, killing 51 people and wounding dozens. Australian Brenton Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with the attack and faces trial next year. Chief Censor David Shanks said a video game that celebrated the livestream of the mass shooting has been classified as objectionable. “The creators of this game set out to produce and sell a game designed to place the player in the role of a white supremacist terrorist killer,” Shanks said in a statement. “In this game, anyone who isn’t a white heterosexual male is a target for simply existing.” Shanks previously outlawed the livestreamed video of Christchurch attack and a manifesto linked to the alleged shooter. Earlier this month, the censor board also outlawed a 35-minute long video of another attack by an anti-Semitic gunman who killed two people in Halle, Germany. A document said to have been shared by the gunman in Germany has now also been banned, Shanks said. Some game producers appear intent on producing a “family” of white extremist games and have established a revenue stream from it, with customers in New Zealand and around the world able to purchase the games from the producer’s website, Shanks said. “The games producers will try to dress their work up as satire but this game is no joke. It crosses the line.” Read Next Build your own iOS 13 app with this expert training Share Selection This story has been shared 51,016 times.

16,https://people.com/human-interest/heart-9-11-helps-puerto-rico/,"""From the horror of 9/11, this was built to get goodness out into the world,"" says Bill Keegan, founder of HEART 9/11 Five days after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September of 2017, Bill Keegan, a retired lieutenant with the Port Authority Police of New York, and a band of New York City firemen, police officers and tradesmen from his nonprofit HEART 9/11 were there on the ground to help. Soon after, actor Ramon Rodriguez, with family on the island, told Keegan he wanted to aid their efforts, and raised more than $500,000 for HEART 9/11’s work to replace missing roofs and rebuild entire homes for free. “When you see your island beat up, it’s heartbreaking,” the 39-year-old Affair actor — who worked with his “best pal,” actress Rosie Perez, on fund-raising — tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue, on newsstands Friday. “We just want to provide a solution. This is about helping human beings.” With government efforts to fix the devastation of Maria slow and inadequate, an estimated 30,000 homes are still without roofs. Carmen Hernandez and her family, who live in the mountain town of Morovis, waited 15 long months living under government-issued blue tarps and with no electricity before her “angels” of HEART 9/11 rebuilt her home. “I wish any family who lost a house to not lose faith,” she says. “HEART 9/11 is always where they’re needed.” RELATED: Why One Puerto Rican Bride Had Her Wedding in the Wake of Hurricane Maria: ‘It Gave Us Hope’ Since HEART 9/11 stepped in, first in underserved areas of the capital of San Juan before spreading out to the mountain towns of Morovis and Orocovis, where Rodriguez’s family lives, it’s replaced some 315 roofs and complete homes for free, with $2.5 million worth of construction materials. While Puerto Rico escaped far more damage when Hurricane Dorian skirted the island Aug. 28, it remains in recovery. “It’s a tough thing to see two years later,” says Rodriguez. “There are so many homes that need work.” For Keegan, 64, a night-operations commander at Ground Zero overseeing rescue and recovery following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, he yearned for this kind of work after retiring in 2005. He asked himself, “What do we do with this trauma and loss from 9/11?” and came up with the idea in 2007 of volunteer emergency-response work and HEART 9/11 (for Healing Emergency Aid Response Team). HEART 9/11 volunteers, who have included some of Keegan’s former colleagues, have since rebuilt homes in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake there; counseled Newtown, Connecticut, first responders after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School; and helped in the aftermath of floods in Texas and Louisiana. RELATED VIDEO: Remembering Hurricane Maria Since Hurricane Maria, Keegan has traveled to Puerto Rico from his New Jersey home so many times he’s lost count. Days after Hurricane Dorian made landfall in the Bahamas, Keegan was on a plane there with volunteers. With an estimated 40,000 homes in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas still needing work, Keegan expects HEART 9/11 to be in both places indefinitely. The U.S. government promised the group funding, but it hasn’t come yet, says Keegan, who hopes private donations keep the work going. (To help go to heart911.org.) Early on in their partnership, Rodriguez and Keegan came up with the idea of starting an apprentice program in Puerto Rico, in which HEART 9/11 volunteers train local residents in construction trades. Maria Socorro Oyola, 47, was a rental car agent who didn’t know how to use a hammer before joining the apprentice program earlier this year. Now she’s a HEART 9/11 project manager. “People lose hope, and we say, ‘We are here to help,’ ” says Socorro Oyola. Adds Keegan: “From the horror of 9/11, this was built to get goodness out into the world.” For more on HEART 9/11, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

17,https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-melania-wouldnt-cry-if-i-was-shot/,"""Not many wives would react that way to tragedy. I know mine wouldn't"" Speaking Tuesday at a Republican fundraiser, President Donald Trump reportedly cracked — kind of, sort of — that First Lady Melania Trump would not be overcome with grief if he was in a tragedy. According to Politico, the president was referring to Rep. Steve Scalise, who was wounded in a mass shooting in 2017, when he said: “[Scalise’s spouse] cried her eyes out when I met her at the hospital that fateful day … I mean, not many wives would react that way to tragedy. I know mine wouldn’t.” President Trump, 73, made the remark while speaking for about an hour at a fundraiser for Take Back the House 2020, the joint fundraising committee of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, according to Politico, which described Trump as “unscripted, unfiltered and totally in his element.” (A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on Trump’s statement about the first lady.) RELATED: Donald Trump and an ‘Upset’ Melania ‘Had Words’ While at Dinner at Mar-a-Lago, Witness Says He reportedly discussed various GOP lawmakers at the dinner, at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. — a mingling of business and politics that has raised ethics concerns throughout his presidency. The fundraiser, attended by some 115 House Republicans, was expected to raise more than $13 million. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, Trump said, had “the best name,” according to Politico: “If I had that name, I would have been president 10 years ago.” Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, had the worst name. Trump also praised the family of Pennsylvania Rep. John Joyce: his “handsome” son and “looker” wife. Indiana Rep. Greg Pence, brother of Vice President Mike Pence, got a joking shout-out. “I know a guy who looks like you,” Trump said, per Politico. “How did you get that good of a seat in here ya cheap-o?” And Trump took a swipe at his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who could once again run for an Alabama Senate seat: “Who is gonna win Alabama? Don’t tell me Sessions.” Curiosity about the Trump marriage has flared in the past, as when he tried and failed to hold his wife’s hand in front of the press or when other women accused him of being unfaithful. In March, a witness told PEOPLE they saw the Trumps having a disagreement at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. “Melania was upset and they had words with each other over something,” the source said. (The White House disputed this.) RELATED: Did Melania Swat Trump’s Hand Again? Twitter Sure Thinks So Mrs. Trump said in an interview last year that she was not fazed by the affair allegations. “It is not a concern and focus of mine,” she told ABC News. “I’m a mother and a first lady and I have much more important things to think about and to do. I know people like to speculate and the media like to speculate about our marriage.” “It’s not always pleasant, of course,” Mrs. Trump said. “But I know what is right and what is wrong and what is true or not true.” Appearing on MSNBC’s Morning Joe during the 2016 campaign, Mrs. Trump said she and the president “have a great relationship. We are own people. I’m my own person. He’s his own person. And I think that’s very important.” “I don’t want to change him,” she said then. “He doesn’t want to change me.” ",2019-10-31 13:24:49,Donald Trump Cracks That Melania Wouldn&#8217;t Cry &#8216;Her Eyes Out&#8217; If He Was Shot: Report,,300472,http://www.people.com/people/

        Peter Aldhous Posted on October 31, 2019, at 4:21 p.m. ET This is part of a BuzzFeed News package on schools and social media surveillance. Read more here. On July 29, a 13-year-old who used to tweet as @valkyries_queen was watching New Girl on Netflix when the plot really got to her. “nick if you dont fall in love with jess again im gonna kill you,” she posted from her pseudonymous account, named after the character Valkyrie, portrayed by her crush, Tessa Thompson, in the Marvel movies. @valkyries_queen had about 220 followers. Her tweet, sent from where she lives in Washington state, didn’t get any replies, any retweets, any attention, really — except from a school district more than 2,000 miles away, in Texas. The tweet triggered the algorithms powering an automated monitoring system called Social Sentinel, which scans social media for language or images suggesting a potential threat to school safety. The system determines which schools the users may be associated with and notes locations they list in their profiles. Social Sentinel sent @valkyries_queen’s tweet to at least five officials in the Katy Independent School District, just outside the Houston metropolitan area. @valkyries_queen had moved away from Katy, Texas, where she used to go to school, some three months previously but still followed her school’s Twitter account. Five of her tweets were flagged to school officials as potential safety threats that July. In one post, she joked about wanting to kill herself; in another, about killing her father because he made a racist joke. In a third, she corrected someone about Valkyrie’s sexual orientation: “If I see one more comment calling Valkyrie a lesbian I'm going to KILL ALL OF YOU. MY GIRL IS BISEXUAL AND IF YOU DONT SHUT UP RN.” @valkyries_queen told BuzzFeed News she wrote all these tweets in jest. She treats her account, as many teens do, as a kind of online journal. “It’s just the fandom,” she said about the New Girl tweet. “They broke up and I was being upset ... like any teen would about a show.” And she’s baffled why school administrations think monitoring her tweets will help anything. “I think that they are just wasting time,” she told BuzzFeed News, “when they could work on real solutions. They think that they are helping when they could go to the government that could prevent kids from dying, like supporting gun laws.” The fact that @valkyries_queen’s tweets got caught in a dragnet is a symptom of a particularly American problem. No other country has a similar epidemic of school shootings. School administrators are under pressure to try anything to prevent the next shooter from murdering their students. And because mass shooters sometimes post warnings, trolling messages, racist screeds, and manifestos before they open fire, schools are increasingly turning to automated digital surveillance. Some districts have purchased software that monitors schools’ own email systems, chats, laptops, and cloud drives for warning signs that students are in danger of harming themselves or others. Social Sentinel is the leading company offering schools a more expansive solution: The firm says it casts a wide net across public posts on social media looking for threats from adults as well as students. “A threat can come from anyone, anywhere, any time. Let us be your early warning system,” reads the cover of a booklet sent to potential customers. But automated algorithms easily confuse a joke or slang with a potential shooter’s threat. And there are implications for students whose posts get flagged, leading administrators to possibly start asking questions like: Why did you say you wanted to “kill” your dad? The founder and CEO of Social Sentinel, based in Burlington, Vermont, is Gary Margolis, a former University of Vermont chief of police. The company, founded in January 2014, has raised at least $12 million in venture capital so far, according to PitchBook, which tracks startup investments. “Our children are sharing all kinds of things digitally, and included in that are potential acts of harm,” Margolis told BuzzFeed News. “We recognized that in the absence of a company like us to figure that out, there are a whole bunch of people and children who communicate nearly 100% with these mediums.” He added, “We set out to build a tool that is respectful of individual rights. Without us, the folks who are responsible for safety and security in a school [are] missing an important piece of the puzzle.” A growing number of school districts have signed up — at least 130 have spent a total of more than $2.5 million on Social Sentinel since August 2014, according to a BuzzFeed News analysis of the GovSpend database. The biggest spike in orders came in the summer of 2018, following shootings in the preceding months at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and Santa Fe High School in Texas. Spending on Social Sentinel per month by clients identified as school districts in the GovSpend database, with school shootings on the same timeline. Circles are scaled by the number of deaths in each incident. To get a better idea of what schools are getting for their money, BuzzFeed News submitted public records requests to more than 40 school districts, asking for the alerts they received from Social Sentinel. Many of them denied our requests, but we received more than 1,800 alerts sent to administrators from eight school districts between May 2017 and September 2019 for which we were able to read the text or view the images in posts that were flagged. For more than 1,200 alerts, we could see which social media platform the flagged posts had appeared on, and for 151 since August, we obtained emails with links to Social Sentinel webpages that revealed why the posts had been associated with the schools. Our analysis of these alerts suggests that while Social Sentinel may provide schools with nuggets of useful intelligence, they have come amid a tsunami of false positives — posts that were picked as potential threats but simply weren’t. And the system seems largely ignorant to social media platforms other than Twitter, missing potential threats posted on other platforms popular with teens. Social Sentinel relies on algorithms to detect language or images that suggest a threat of violence or self-harm. “It’s part of a total strategy, and not intended to be the only tool needed to prevent violence or identify threats — nor is it marketed that way,” Social Sentinel spokesperson Alison Miley said in written answers to questions from BuzzFeed News. “Further, we don’t focus solely on potential or active shooters; we more broadly are looking at mental health issues, wellness, and more. On numerous occasions we have identified situations that required attention.” Miley said that the company has tweaked its algorithms to reduce the number of false positives and trained clients on what to expect when they sign up. “In this past year alone, we have advanced our algorithms significantly,” she said. BuzzFeed News found that posts that were flagged by Social Sentinel were much more likely to contain words including “kill,” “school,” “murder,” and “shooting” than posts from the same users that didn’t trigger an alert. Words used most frequently in 190 tweets flagged by Social Sentinel as potential safety threats in July–September compared to 11,265 tweets from the same accounts over the same period. The percentage refers to the frequency of a word’s use in each category after removing Twitter handles, hashtags, numbers, and very common words like “the,” “I’m,” and “at.” But it’s hard to train algorithms to understand hyperbole, irony, slang, and context. Social Sentinel has seemed to struggle to tell the difference between people tweeting about a meal being “bomb” and an explosive device, and to recognize that shooting in basketball isn’t a safety concern. In August, Leah Breault, a 21-year-old college student in Winter Park, Florida, tweeted an inside joke that was flagged to school administrators in Seminole County, Florida: Brandon: I’m going to shoot myself. In the platonic way

Me: as opposed to what? The romantic way? 

Brandon: METAPHORICAL Breault told BuzzFeed News she wasn’t surprised that an algorithm didn’t get her peer group’s dark sense of humor. “School shootings, climate change, the political madness right now … we just take the amount of bad news that we’ve been given, basically the news that the world is ending, and are trying to roll with it,” she said. “I read 1st day of school and my vibe was shot,” tweeted Kyle, 18, in late July, getting flagged by Social Sentinel to Katy school administrators. “I don’t think a software can detect slang and other forms of communication,” he told BuzzFeed News. Miley said that Social Sentinel’s algorithms do look for slang and context, but err on the side of caution in what is flagged to school officials. “Our model is conservative because we don’t want to miss anything,” she said. Most of the posts that Social Sentinel flagged seemed benign. This tweet, from an elementary school basketball coach, was among those flagged as a potential threat to Fairfield City School District in Ohio. (The coach didn’t return a request for comment.): Workouts are Tuesday and Wednesday after school. Friday morning is shooting. 🏀 More problematic for school safety officials are posts containing violent language for which it’s hard for algorithms and humans to determine a credible threat. One Twitter user triggered repeated alerts to Flagler County Public Schools in Florida over several weeks in late 2018, tweeting about killing, rape, and stabbing — sometimes nonsensically. One post said: “Here you kill me first and then after I die I kill you.” The most obviously disturbing post among the hundreds that BuzzFeed News reviewed was also sent to Flagler in December 2018. A user whose screen name was redacted by the district tweeted: “i’m going to kill myself. sooner or later it will happen. i promise that.” Flagler County Public Schools said it was no longer using Social Sentinel and wouldn’t comment on its security measures. Deaths in school shootings since 2014. Circles are scaled by the number of people killed in each incident. It was the Santa Fe shooting that prompted the Clear Creek Independent School District, southeast of Houston, to sign up for Social Sentinel. “At the time, we were in a very heightened state,” Elaina Polsen, the district’s chief communications officer, told BuzzFeed News. But its school safety officers have found themselves in the difficult position of investigating and reporting potential cries for help, similar to the redacted Flagler alert, from adults who had no connection to the district’s schools. “We were committing staff time into it, just because we weren’t going to ignore them,” Polsen said. In a year of using Social Sentinel, which cost the district more than $64,000, it didn’t receive a single alert highlighting a credible threat. “There was nothing in the data we received that was actionable on our end,” Polsen said. “We would equate it to chasing ghosts.” Clear Creek told Social Sentinel it was canceling its contract in June. Some school districts told BuzzFeed News that Social Sentinel had drawn their attention to students with suicidal thoughts. “The day-to-day usefulness of Social Sentinel is very, very minimal,” said Chris Wynn, director of security at a school district in California. “But within our first month of having Social Sentinel in place, we had a suicidal student post where we intervened, and I’m pretty sure we would not have caught that without it.” Wynn had been researching social media monitoring software for months before entering a contract with Social Sentinel. “There are probably other things that we do that are more invasive than social media monitoring,” Wynn said. “For example, we do random metal detector searches.” He sees it as one of many tools that are helpful in protecting students — both from outside threats and potentially from themselves. “Most of what we get is not shooter or security threats. It’s self-harm. It’s kids with low self-esteem,” he said. Anna Nolin, superintendent of Natick Public Schools in Massachusetts, told BuzzFeed News that Social Sentinel alerts kept officials abreast of two fast-moving incidents earlier this year. In March, an 18-year-old man drove through the Natick High School campus, shouting racial slurs and firing a paintball gun. Students tweeted about it immediately. The next month, the school was briefly put on lockdown after someone contacted a veterans suicide hotline falsely claiming to be at Natick High School with a gun, planning to shoot himself. The hoaxer, who was a student, also gave a cellphone number of a girl at the school. “The Twitter feed is faster than our emergency communications,” Nolin told BuzzFeed News. During the second incident, she could see from Social Sentinel that parents were reacting to rumors about a shooter on the school tennis court and tweeting at their kids to ignore teachers’ instructions to move to assembly points outside. She called the principal, who was able to make an announcement on the school’s public address system. Several school officials said that software like Social Sentinel was part of a suite of tools that helped them identify students with mental health issues and those who were in need of counselors. Our analysis also revealed that Social Sentinel may have major blind spots. Of the 151 posts for which we had metadata on why they were associated with the schools involved, 128 of them were from users whose profiles indicated a nearby location. Forty-six users followed a social media account linked to the school, and five posts were flagged because of keywords related to the schools. (Some posts were associated with a school for more than one reason.) So anyone who doesn’t note their true location in their profile, or doesn’t follow a school-related account, seems unlikely to be flagged by Social Sentinel. But the most striking finding was the fact that 1,180 of the 1,206 alerts for which we could see the social media platform involved Twitter. There were 15 posts on YouTube, eight on the now-defunct social network Google+, two comments left on schools’ own Facebook pages, and just one Instagram post, from a drone photographer. Social Sentinel says it monitors a billion posts a day from platforms including Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. But it focuses on public posts, using data from official feeds, rendering it largely ignorant of potential threats on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and other popular platforms with privacy settings that make many posts invisible. “We believe Snapchat would be an important platform to include in our scanning solutions but they don’t allow it,” said Miley, the Social Sentinel spokesperson. “We assess publicly available data from the social media partners in accordance with approved use cases.” Some of the most notorious school shooters who left public warning signs on social media did so on social networks other than Twitter. The suspect in the Parkland shooting posed with a gun and knives on Instagram, while the teen charged with the Santa Fe killings was pictured on Facebook wearing a T-shirt bearing the phrase “born to kill.” Several school administrators told BuzzFeed News that the lion’s share of threats they see on social media are on platforms that are more popular with teens than Twitter and that have higher privacy settings — in particular Snapchat. Snap, the company that runs Snapchat, told BuzzFeed News that it was concerned abut the privacy implications and legality of sharing data with third parties, adding that safety concerns can be reported from within the app to Snap, which can alert authorities. On Sunday, Aug. 25, police in Winter Springs, Florida, a suburb of Orlando, received reports about a Snapchat post from a 14-year-old boy, posing with what turned out to be a BB gun, captioned, “dont come to school tomorrow.” School officials were notified, and after the threat was determined not to be credible, Winter Springs High School called parents with the message: “Parents, please remind your students that making comments of this nature, even if made in a joking manner, is something that will not be tolerated and will be immediately reported to Law Enforcement.” The boy was arrested and was charged with making threats to kill, do bodily injury, or conduct a mass shooting. Winter Springs High School is part of Seminole County Public Schools, which is a Social Sentinel client. Because the company doesn’t have access to Snapchat data, the boy’s post wasn’t flagged. The system did alert the district to a comment posted shortly afterward on the Winter Springs High School Facebook page by a concerned parent, who wrote: “It is illegal what he did and im not comfortable with my son going to school With someone that thinks its a joke to shoot the school up.” Seminole County Public Schools declined to comment on that incident, but district spokesperson Michael Lawrence told BuzzFeed News by email: “There’s a variety of ways for us to get alerts and notifications of school threats aside from Social Sentinel.” Social Sentinel’s focus on public social media posts is supposed to ease concerns about privacy. But on the Facebook group “A Better Legacy For Katy ISD,” which describes itself as a “citizen watchdog group that holds Katy ISD accountable,” there was still backlash when the system was about to be introduced. “How can they monitor my social media? Just because I live in the boundaries doesn’t give them the right!!!! This is ridiculous!!!!!” posted Lori Coddington-funk. “So we are going to pay big MONEY to a surveillance company to spy on our kids? That’s the solution? Absolutely NOT acceptable. This is not a solution I want or need,” commented Anna Lisa Gendron. In all, eight of the school districts we contacted had canceled the service. Some, like Katy and Clear Creek, said they got much better intelligence from anonymous online tip lines, which school districts in Texas are mandated by law to operate. (Social Sentinel has also started offering schools an anonymous tip service.) Within a week of opening its tip line, Katy spokesperson Maria Corrales-DiPetta told BuzzFeed News that administrators had received 100 tips. Polsen said that Clear Creek had received 27 tips related to school safety since the start of the school year in August. Many concerned threats made on Snapchat or by text message. “That’s the world that we’re dealing with,” Polsen said. ● Additional reporting by Jeremy Singer-Vine.

THIS IS THURSDAY’S [SPOOKY] PULSE, where we’re celebrating multiple holidays today (but mainly just the Nats World Series win). Dan Diamond is back on the mound today — cheer him on with news and tips to [email protected]. OBAMACARE MARKETS BACK IN BUSINESS FRIDAY — Three years into a presidency that promised to kill the health care law, it's arguably never been stronger. Consumers shopping on HealthCare.gov will pay 4 percent less, on average, for the most popular plans. Six states have reported double-digit declines. And it seems the wave of insurer exits and rate hikes – though plans are still pricey for those not getting government help – are a thing of the past, POLITICO’s Dan Goldberg reports. The view from HHS: “We believe the Affordable Care Act simply doesn’t work,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar told reporters last week, even as he and other administration officials take credit for stabilizing the insurance marketplaces. “But until Congress gets around to replacing it, the president will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans.” The view from Obamacare supporters: They say the administration deserves zero credit for the marketplaces, especially as it supports a lawsuit to strike down the health law. Other factors are contributing to the improving marketplaces, they say, arguing they’d be in better shape if the Trump administration hadn’t slashed outreach budgets, expanded skimpier insurance plans, killed a subsidy program and so on. But there’s a major threat looming: Any day now, a federal appeals court could rule on whether to uphold a decision from a federal judge striking down the whole law. Even a narrower decision could be chaotic, though the case is widely expected to reach the Supreme Court. COMING THIS AFTERNOON: GEORGIA TO UNVEIL OBAMACARE WAIVER — Gov. Brian Kemp will release a highly anticipated overhaul of the state’s individual insurance market, a proposal he’s pursued alongside a partial Medicaid expansion, POLITICO’s Rachana Pradhan reports. The first-year Republican governor will release his Obamacare waiver proposal a day after Senate Democrats made a largely symbolic, yet failed, attempt to kill Trump administration guidance giving states greater leeway to skirt the 2010 health law’s insurance mandates. So far, no state has submitted a plan to HHS that takes advantage of the Trump administration’s approach. Georgia officials plan to submit both the Obamacare overhaul and its Medicaid plan to the Trump administration before the end of the year, in hopes that it gets approved in 2020.

To forge a compromise, the administration is willing to sacrifice a key Democratic provision in a Senate Finance Committee plan to firm up GOP support, domestic policy adviser Joe Grogan told POLITICO’s Sarah Owermohle. — Chairman Chuck Grassleyand Sen. Ron Wyden the panel’s top Democrat, have touted their bill, S. 2543 (116), as the most viable answer to high drug prices. The problem? Many Republicans hate how it caps Medicare Part D price hikes at annual inflation rates. Nine GOP lawmakers voted against the measure in committee. Administration officials have had frequent conversations with Grassley to encourage changes to win more bipartisan backing for the measure, Grogan said. Grogan said he is still in talks with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about her legislation, which would let the government negotiate the prices of certain drugs. But he said the bill likely won't get far. “I admire the ambition, but I don’t know how you’re going to get it through,"" Grogan said. ""It might be time to start thinking about [the Senate Finance bill].” — A Pelosi spokesperson hit back: “President Trump used to insist that we needed to ‘negotiate like crazy’ to lower prescription drug prices, and House Democrats’ legislation is the only bill that includes negotiation,” Henry Connelly wrote in an email. SEN. BILL CASSIDY'S ODDS FOR A DRUG PRICE BILL BY DEC. 31? Sixty percent, the Louisiana Republican said Wednesday at the Milken Institute’s health summit in Washington. Cassidy, a GOP leader on health care issues, said that he’s an “optimist” that Congress can hammer out legislation. Cassidy was among a handful of Republicans to vote to advance the Finance Committee's drug price package to the floor earlier this summer. He defended the measure, saying it strikes a balance between affordability and encouraging drugmakers to innovate. JUDGE SAYS TRUMP’S 'CONSCIENCE RULE' DOESN’T HAVE FORCE OF LAW — A federal judge on Wednesday contended that Congress did not explicitly give HHS authority to expand the ability for health care workers to refuse to provide care based on religious or moral objections. The case was brought by California, two counties and advocacy groups. U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup seemed inclined to issue a decision before new Trump rules are slated to take effect Nov. 22. A federal judge in New York heard oral arguments nearly two weeks ago in a similar case brought by 26 states, municipalities and health care providers. A judge in Washington state is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a separate suit Nov. 7. ADVOCACY GROUPS SUE OVER TRUMP’S NEW INSURANCE REQUIREMENT FOR VISA-SEEKERS — The groups, which are suing in Oregon federal court, want to stop Trump’s Oct. 4 proclamation mandating visa-seekers prove they can get health insurance from taking effect early next month. Privately, officials who oversee the nation’s health insurance markets have also raised concerns. They’re worried it may be unworkable or even illegal, POLITICO reported earlier this month.

SENATORS PRESS CMS ON VIRTUAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM — A bipartisan group of 19 senators want CMS to lay out its plans on a virtual version of the diabetes prevention program. The group, who aired concerns in a letter Wednesday, comes in the wake of a POLITICO report showing CMS’s implementation of the diabetes prevention program has gone poorly. — The program uses nutrition and exercise coaching to avert or delay the development of type 2 diabetes among at-risk patients, and CMS had projected tens of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries would sign up each year. — But an analysis of Medicare claims data for POLITICO suggested as few as 202 beneficiaries took up the benefit in 2018. That’s due to CMS policies restricting the supply of providers. In-person providers are forced to undergo extensive anti-fraud and security procedures, while digital providers aren’t allowed into traditional Medicare at all. STUDY: TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION COMMENTS IMPACT ON EMERGENCY CARE — About 1 in 4 Latino undocumented immigrants living in California said they’re afraid to use emergency departments because of Trump's rhetoric about immigrants. That’s according to research published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One. Researchers conducted the study at three California hospitals, surveying over 1,330 adults, including 500 undocumented immigrants. The lead author underscored the potential impact of delaying or foregoing care. “If there’s a barrier or even the perception of a barrier … that’s a problem,” said Robert Rodriguez, an emergency medicine professor at UC San Francisco.

Rudy Giuiani has seemingly compared his experience of forgetting his own iPhone password to the FBI asking Apple for access to a mass shooter's phone. Giuiani, the newly appointed cybersecurity adviser to President Donald Trump,   was reacting to a report by NBC News earlier Thursday saying he needed an Apple Genius to help get into his phone because he entered the passcode incorrectly 10 times. It also follows him butt dialing a NBC News journalist and accidentally leaving a voicemail of a private conversation last week. ""Hey @NBCNews, last I checked the FBI, last year, had to ask Apple to unlock an iPhone too!"" he tweeted Thursday evening. ""We're all human, just maybe not tonight..."" he added, referencing Halloween with a pumpkin emoji. He's likely referring to the 2015 San Bernardino, California, mass shooting that left 14 people dead, after which an iPhone belonging to the suspect was at the center of a legal battle between the government and Apple. The US government had wanted Apple to produce software that could unlock the phone, but Apple refused. The Department of Justice in March 2016 said it eventually used an outside party to help break into the iPhone 5C. The FBI released a 100-page document in January 2017 detailing how it broke into the smartphone, but much of the report was redacted. According to NBC News Thursday, the Apple Genius incident with Giuliani happened back in February 2017 in San Francisco. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

        Molly Hensley-Clancy Last updated on November 1, 2019, at 6:49 p.m. ET Posted on November 1, 2019, at 5:37 p.m. ET Beto O'Rourke, who began this year as one of the Democratic Party's stars, has ended his presidential campaign. ""Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,"" he wrote in a Medium post published Friday. O'Rourke announced the end of his campaign just hours before he was expected to speak at the Liberty and Justice Celebration dinner Friday night in Des Moines. His supporters had been up since 5 a.m., lining the sidewalks outside the arena where the dinner was to take place with hundreds of his trademark black signs. O'Rourke addressed his campaign's volunteers — many of whom were in shock and crying — in front of 7-foot-high letters that read ""No Fear."" ""My service will not be as a candidate or a nominee for this party,"" he told them. ""I love you all."" Peggy Crowe, who came to Des Moines from Asheville, North Carolina, for the event, told BuzzFeed News: ""I've never been in politics before. Because of him, I felt hope. I'm a better person because of him, directly because of him."" People here in Beto’s camp are sobbing and hugging each other at the news he’s leaving the race. It’s a pretty brutal scene - you can hear the elated cheers of other campaigns in the distance. I’ve met supporters that traveled here from Austin and Asheville to see Beto tonight. O'Rourke became a national political celebrity on the left after his unsuccessful 2018 Senate race in Texas against Ted Cruz, pushing him to quickly move from a former member of Congress to a top presidential prospect. He spent much of the winter after his closer-than-expected Senate defeat slowly moving toward a presidential campaign, first with a road trip he documented on Medium and later with a splashy interview with Oprah Winfrey. His entrance into the race was made with a Vanity Fair cover story, which included a portrait shot by Annie Leibovitz. But his campaign struggled to gain traction into the spring and summer. He was criticized early on for not having a clear enough purpose for his campaign, or a set of policies that set him apart from the large pool of candidates. Late this summer, after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, O'Rourke refocused his campaign on ending gun violence, pushing for an overhaul of how the US regulates guns. ""When El Paso happened, he found this solid place. He was willing to stand up to everybody,"" Crowe said Friday night. ""I think he has a better chance to make his mark against the gun lobby. He can go down in the history books."" Krystal Reilly, who came to Des Moines from Austin, said through tears: ""To hear someone speak so loudly about criminal justice and giving rights to people of color and people who don’t love the same or look the same, it was so inspiring. It was very Kennedy-esque, that he just truly felt he could bring people together."" This is a developing story. Check back for updates and follow BuzzFeed News on Twitter.

I will do everything that I can to support the eventual nominee of this party with everything that I’ve got. And I encourage every single one of you to do the same. I will still be part of all the causes that brought us here together in the first place, whether it is ending gun violence, or confronting climate change before it is too late, or addressing the structural racism in America, or making sure this economy works for every single one of us.

For this country, which we are going to come through for now, at its defining moment of truth. By Alexander Burns Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas announced on Friday that he was dropping out of the presidential race, ending a campaign in which he struggled for months to recapture the energy of his insurgent 2018 Senate candidacy on a national stage full of other big personalities and liberal champions. Mr. O’Rourke made the decision to quit the race in the middle of this week, on the eve of a gathering of Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, according to people familiar with his thinking. He is not expected to run for any other office in 2020, despite persistent efforts by party leaders and political donors to coax him into another bid for the Senate. His campaign has been under extreme financial strain, and Mr. O’Rourke’s advisers concluded that proceeding in the race might have meant making deep cuts to his staff in order to pay for advertising and other measures to compete in the early primary and caucus states. The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump. Mr. O’Rourke confirmed his withdrawal in a post on Medium and in an email message to his supporters. In that message, Mr. O’Rourke said he was proud of championing issues like guns and climate change but conceded that his campaign lacked “the means to move forward successfully.” “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,” he said. By leaving the race, Mr. O’Rourke completes the winding path from his early status as a potential front-runner to his drastic decision over the summer to reframe his candidacy as an activist crusader following the mass shooting targeting Latinos in his home city of El Paso. Since then, Mr. O’Rourke has campaigned doggedly on issues related to guns and race, calling most notably for federal gun-control policies that would require owners of assault-style weapons to surrender them to the government. That’s a far more aggressive stance than most Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed. That last phase of his campaign has taken Mr. O’Rourke far beyond the early-state circuit, and included visits with prison inmates in California and an immigrant community in Mississippi. In an August interview following the El Paso massacre, Mr. O’Rourke said his focus would be “taking the fight to Donald Trump” and “being with those who have been denigrated and demeaned.” In recent weeks, he has also criticized other Democrats in newly strident terms, declaring in September that Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and Senate minority leader, had accomplished “absolutely nothing” on gun control. Mr. Schumer, an architect of gun control legislation in the 1990s, said he saw no support in the party for Mr. O’Rourke’s stance on requiring gun owners to surrender certain firearms. At a rally in Des Moines on Friday evening, Mr. O’Rourke told supporters he made his decision “so recently and so reluctantly.’’ “We have to clearly see at this point that we do not now have the means” to continue, he said, adding: “Though this is the end of this campaign, we are right in the middle of this fight.” In a hallway outside the venue of an Iowa Democrats dinner, where Mr. O’Rourke had been scheduled to appear, a black-draped table for his campaign was abandoned Friday night. Passers-by helped themselves from the roll of “Beto” stickers sitting on the table, near a cardboard box full of one-sheet guides to “our most common cheers.” “So sad!” a woman exclaimed as she walked by. “It’s so sad.” Mr. O’Rourke entered the 2020 primary in the middle of March with the aura of a celebrity, cheered by rank-and-file Democrats and admired by no less a figure than former President Barack Obama for his near-miss challenge to Senator Ted Cruz in the nation’s largest red state. He effectively unveiled his run for the White House in a cover story for Vanity Fair in which he declared he was “just born to be in it.” He later described the cover, along with his choice of words, as a mistake. In the earliest days of his campaign, Mr. O’Rourke was a fund-raising powerhouse, collecting more than $6 million in his first day as a candidate. But his fund-raising cratered almost immediately. He raised more in his first 48 hours than in the following 100 days, and steadily depleted his campaign treasury by spending more than he was taking in. Elizabeth Warren saw her fund-raising increase once again. Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought in less money. Bernie Sanders remains strong. New fund-raising numbers reveal the shifting financial fortunes of 2020 Democrats. And despite the near-heroic status he achieved in the eyes of Democratic voters as a daring challenger to a Republican they loathed — Mr. Cruz — Mr. O’Rourke found it far more difficult to stand out from a crop of presidential candidates that included other young orators, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and determined progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. O’Rourke also came under harsh attack in a June debate from Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and a fellow Texan, who blasted Mr. O’Rourke from the left on immigration. Mr. O’Rourke, who was not an especially strong debater in his Senate campaign, appeared badly caught off guard. To Mr. O’Rourke and his allies, it has been evident for some time that he was confronting a vanishingly slim path forward. At the last Democratic debate, a pair of Mr. O’Rourke’s donors flew to Ohio to meet with him about his campaign and the possibility of him quitting the race to run for Senate in Texas against John Cornyn, who is up for re-election. Mr. O’Rourke told them he was not running for Senate, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesman to Mr. O’Rourke reiterated that stance on Friday. “Beto will not be a candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas in 2020,” said Rob Friedlander, an aide to Mr. O’Rourke. It is unclear whether Mr. O’Rourke’s exit will have a significant impact on the larger shape of the Democratic primary race. In a New York Times/Siena College poll released on Friday, Mr. O’Rourke was supported by just 1 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa. He had not yet met the thresholds for participating in the upcoming primary debates in November and December. Mr. O’Rourke may find — as other former candidates have done — that the good will of his fellow Democrats returns quickly once he is no longer a competitor for the nomination. He is 47 years old, leaving him plenty of time to consider a return to electoral politics. But in a recent interview with Politico, Mr. O’Rourke said that if he did not prevail in the 2020 presidential primary he would not become a candidate again. “I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I’m not the nominee,” Mr. O’Rourke said last month.

	Gene Maddaus Senior Media Writer Beto O’Rourke, the former congressman from El Paso, Texas, announced on Friday that he’s withdrawing from the presidential race. O’Rourke captivated party regulars only a year ago, coming within a few points of unseating Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the midterm election. That campaign was fueled by massive contributions from small-dollar donors. That strategy initially worked for O’Rourke’s presidential bid, which had buzz and fundraising momentum when he launched in March. But the enthusiasm quickly petered out, and O’Rourke struggled to raise money from more traditional sources. “Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” O’Rourke wrote on Medium. “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.”  O’Rourke’s campaign spent more than he collected in the third quarter — a discouraging sign at this stage — finishing with $3.2 million in the bank. He barely registered in early state polls, coming in around 1%, and had yet to qualify for the next Democratic debate later this month. Popular on Variety O’Rourke struggled initially to define his campaign, but found a sense of purpose following the mass shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3, in which 22 people — mostly Latino — were killed by a white supremacist. O’Rourke’s policy proposal — the banning of AR-15s and other assault weapons, accompanied by a mandatory buyback — stirred the hearts of some gun safety activists, while making others nervous that it might go too far. The proposal was deeply unpopular in Texas, potentially a fatal blow to his viability in any future run for statewide office. In his farewell message, O’Rourke said he would support the Democratic nominee. “Let us continue to fearlessly champion the issues and causes that brought us together,” he said. “Whether it is ending the epidemic of gun violence or dismantling structural racism or successfully confronting climate change before it is too late, we will continue to organize and mobilize and act in the best interests of America.” The Business of Entertainment",2019-11-01 17:55:06,Beto O&#8217;Rourke Drops Out of Presidential Race,,19076,http://www.variety.com

32,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/11/01/breaking-beto-orourke-quits-presidential-race/,"Golly. Between the Harris news and this, today’s turned out to be an embarrassment of schadenfreudean riches! I’m sure Beto’s political future will be fine. He can go back to Texas now and run on [checks notes] confiscating guns and taxing churches. Oh, and tearing down the border fence near El Paso. Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully. My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country… We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020. I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I’m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is. And proud to call them President in January 2021, because they will win. What happened? His polling never took off, of course, but that’s no obstacle to campaigning like a demon in Iowa and hoping for the best. The obstacle was money. As Harris has also learned, when polls tank, so does fundraising and then hard choices on personnel and self-promotion need to be made. O’Rourke was in deep trouble, notes the Times: “His campaign has been under extreme financial strain, and Mr. O’Rourke’s advisers concluded that proceeding in the race might have meant making deep cuts to his staff in order to pay for advertising and other measures to compete in the early primary and caucus state.” He was unlikely to make the next debate as well. The writing was on the wall. Within the past few minutes, after the news broke, the president duly administered the coup de grace: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190385966621569024 O’Rourke had a weird journey over the past eight months. When he got in, he was hit with a bunch of bad press questioning his progressive bona fides by Berniebros who feared that Betomania might seduce lefties away from Sanders. That fear proved unfounded, as O’Rourke discovered that the national support he enjoyed when he was the knight battling the evil dragon Ted Cruz didn’t carry over when he was battling Sanders, Warren, Biden, and Buttigieg. The mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso handed him a chance to reboot. Suddenly a guy who had been running on Kennedyesque charisma had a purpose. He would lead the crusade to confiscate America’s assault weapons. Having turned the wokeness dial to 10 on that issue, he decided to do the same on ending the tax-exemption for religious institutions that refuse to recognize gay marriage. Beto now had a real political identity: Progressive culture warrior, a guy who couldn’t out-left Bernie and Warren on economics but could certainly try to out-left them on cultural issues by taking a maximalist position on Democratic grievances. It … did not work: Beto had 3 respondents in the Times/Siena Iowa poll today, matching John Delaney's tally — Nate Cohn (@Nate_Cohn) November 1, 2019  That’s one legacy of Beto’s campaign. He proved that total purity in culture war is not only insufficient to win the Democratic nomination, it’s insufficient to crack one percent. (He’s not the only candidate to have proved that point, either.) His other legacy is that, unusually for a candidate who flamed out so early in the process, he may have done his party lasting damage. Chris Coons complained after O’Rourke’s call for confiscating guns at the September debate that the clip would be used against Democrats for years to come as evidence of their true intentions in regulating firearms. The same is true of O’Rourke’s interest in punishing churches by taxing them for their sin against wokeness in opposing same-sex unions. His role in the campaign ultimately was to confirm conservatives’ worst suspicions about the liberal id. Maybe uniquely among this year’s field, he did his tribe more harm than good by running. Democrats are reportedly still leaning on him to consider taking on John Cornyn for Senate, per the Times, but Beto has been adamant in saying he won’t run. Realistically, how could he? Although he’d return to the good graces of progressives soon enough by challenging Cornyn, his cultural rhetoric is likely too extreme even for a state that’s been turning bluer. The guy may have wrecked his political future in a hamfisted attempt to win the presidency by out-woking everyone. Amazing.

33,https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/armed-man-at-missouri-walmart-pleads-guilty-to-lesser-charge/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. News By Associated Press Submit November 1, 2019 | 6:53pm SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — A man who caused panic at a Missouri Walmart when he walked inside wearing body armor and carrying loaded weapons in what he described as an effort to test his right to bear arms pleaded guilty to making a false report Friday after initially being charged with a more serious terrorist-related felony. Dmitriy Andreychenko, 21, pleaded guilty to an amended misdemeanor charge after originally being charged with making a terrorist threat. Police arrested Andreychenko on Aug. 8 after he filmed himself walking through the store with the weapons, prompting shoppers and employees to leave. The incident came just days after 22 people were killed during an attack at another Walmart in El Paso, Texas. An off-duty firefighter held Andreychenko at gunpoint until officers arrived. Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson said in a news release Friday that Andreychenko didn’t intend to carry out a shooting, but was conducting what he called a “social experiment” in the wake of the Texas shooting and another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio. The release said Andreychenko had researched both shootings and saved the alleged manifesto of the El Paso shooter on his phone. On the day before the shooting, he posted a picture to Snapchat of a family member wearing his body armor looking down the sights of a rifle with the caption, “Watch out Walmart.” Under the terms of the plea, he was ordered to serve 48 hours of shock incarceration and two years of probation. He also must receive firearm training, Patterson said the release. The making a terrorist threat carried a sentence of up to four years in prison. Andreychenko’s attorney, Dee Wampler, said in a statement released Friday in advance of the plea that Andreychenko is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. “His intention was to make a statement of his right to openly carry a firearm, which was legal but — for which he now admits was ill-timed given a recent Texas Walmart shooting,” the statement said. “It was a very bad idea which he now regrets. Regardless of how it looked, he never intended to harm or frighten anyone and merely saw it as a way to exercise his rights.” During an interview with KYTV in August, Andreychenko said the act was “foolish” and “innocent,” but he did not regret his actions. Andreychenko started to record himself with his phone while he was still in the car parked at Walmart. He got the body armor from the trunk of his car and put it on before grabbing a shopping cart and walking into the store, according to the probable cause statement. Andreychenko said his intention was to buy grocery bags. The rifle had a loaded magazine inserted, but a round was not chambered. A handgun on his right hip was loaded with one round in the chamber. “I wanted to know if Walmart honored the Second Amendment,” the probable cause statement quoted Andreychenko as saying. His wife, Angelice Andreychenko, told investigators that she warned him it was not a good idea, adding that he was an immature boy. His attorney added in Friday’s statement that he should have listened to his wife’s advice. The probable cause statement does not allege that he pointed the weapons at anyone, although patrons in the surveillance video could be seen in the background running away. Walmart said in a statement following the incident that it allows concealed and open carry in stores if it is legal in the jurisdictions where the stores are located. It later said it was requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its Walmart and Sam’s Club stores unless they are law enforcement officers. However, it said that it won’t be changing its policy for customers who have permits for concealed carry. Walmart says it will be adding signage in stores to inform customers of those changes. Since January 2017, Missouri has not required a permit to openly or conceal carry a firearm for those 19 years or older. Roughly 30 states allow the open carrying of handguns and rifles and shotguns in public without a permit. Springfield is about 165 miles south of Kansas City, Missouri.

34,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/newsy-allvideos/~3/HUqbgIcvqNk/,"People across the U.S. are remembering the victims of the August El Paso, Texas, mass shooting through the Mexican holiday Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. On Aug. 3, 22 people were killed in an attack at an El Paso Walmart. The city's population is mostly Hispanic or Latino, and the gunman reportedly told police he targeted people he believed to be ""Mexicans."" Día de los Muertos is celebrated from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2. These three days are dedicated to remembering the lives of dead loved ones. Traditionally, celebrants create altars featuring the names of the loved ones, flowers, candles and the colorful sugar skulls that are most associated with the holiday. Since most of the El Paso attack victims were of Mexican descent, some people have decided to dedicate altars to them. The University of Texas at El Paso built an altar for them in its Special Collections Department. Claudia Rivers, the head of that department, said this year's decorations are different from previous years. She told NBC News: ""Usually we include something humorous; we include toys and dancing skeletons. But this year we didn't use much humor in the altar. ... It was a racist attack in a town that is more than 80% Latino, and we are still shaken and in mourning."" Chicago's National Museum of Mexican Art is also dedicating a special altar to the El Paso victims. The museum's president told NBC that in recent years, the altars have been dedicated to a tragedy. This year's altar includes crosses and balloons with the number 22 on them to honor the 22 victims. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

35,https://www.theroot.com/beto-his-campaign-pockets-light-and-his-poll-numbers-l-1839549692,"Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke on Friday took himself out of the running for the Democratic presidential nomination, bowing to low campaign coffers and even lower poll numbers. The once-darling of the Democratic Party, who won acclaim last year when he came within mere points of beating Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in historically red Texas, entered the race for the Democratic presidential nod to much fanfare and millions in donor dollars, the New York Times reports. But within weeks, both his poll numbers and donor dollars dropped as his candidacy failed to ignite passions. “Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” O’Rourke wrote on Medium, according to the Associated Press. “Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.” O’Rourke tried to remake his campaign during the summer—especially after a mass shooting targeting the Latinx community occurred in his hometown of El Paso, Texas—with the candidate going hard on gun reform, as well as on matters of race. As the Times reports: That last phase of his campaign ha[d] taken Mr. O’Rourke far beyond the early-state circuit, and included visits with prison inmates in California and an immigrant community in Mississippi. In an August interview following the El Paso massacre, Mr. O’Rourke said his focus would be “taking the fight to Donald Trump” and “being with those who have been denigrated and demeaned.” But that approach also failed to catch fire, especially in a crowded Democratic field with a number of progressive candidates also speaking out on guns and racial inequality. Latest polling Friday showed O’Rourke with support of just 1 percent among likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, the first major contest in the presidential primary season, according to the Times. He also hadn’t yet met the requirements to participate in the next primary debates this month and December. “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,” O’Rourke tweeted.

36,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/ZU7r3UH0p1E/,"Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke ended his flailing presidential campaign on Friday, right before the Iowa state party’s big event. O’Rourke had everything going for him as he entered the presidential race: A post-Senate race media coverage glow, a big appearance with Oprah, a private meeting with former President Barack Obama, and winning some of the top political talent in the business to help him run his campaign. But his lack of discipline and poor fundraising ultimately doomed his campaign as he grew impatient with the process of running for president. Here is a look back at the big moments in Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke’s campaign: “I want to be in it. Man, I’m just born to be in it,” he told Vanity Fair right before announcing his presidential run. O’Rourke was riding high after photographer Annie Leibovitz followed him around Texas as he organized a counter-rally against President Donald Trump, who was also rallying in Beto’s hometown of El Paso. “Man, I’m just born to be in it.” Beto O’Rourke seemed to come from nowhere to the brink of a presidential candidacy—but he’s been on this journey for his whole life.

I said, ‘Is he crazy or is that just how he acts?’” Trump noted in March. In October, Trump celebrated that O’Rourke was sinking in the polls. “I called him right, remember? The flailing arms?” Trump asked, waving his arms around. “Nobody noticed it, I noticed it, the flailer, remember he was flailing all over the place.” “I don’t know, like, members of the press, what the fuck?” O’Rourke snapped after they asked the congressman if Trump could heal the nation after the mass shooting in El Paso. “He’s not tolerating racism, he’s promoting racism. He’s not tolerating violence, he’s inciting racism and violence in this country,” he said. O’Rourke’s comment immediately drew headlines, as leftists who felt the same way about the president cheered him on. “Can the F-Bomb Save Beto?” Politico wondered in an article. O’Rourke was also caught on tape dropping f-bombs during a documentary on his campaign against Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018. “I know I was a giant asshole to be around sometimes,” O’Rourke acknowledged after the documentary was released. In March, O’Rourke even promised a voter that he would stop using the f-word. “I don’t intend to use the F-word going forward. Point taken, and very strongly made. … We’re going to keep it clean,” he said. But in July, he joked with writer Jemele Hill that ‘Don’t Be a Fuckstick” could be his new campaign slogan. While it is unclear whether Beto O’Rourke personally ordered it, his campaign staff asked police to escort Breitbart editor Joel Pollak out of a campaign event with students at a historically black college event. “A campaign staffer made the call to ask him to leave to ensure that the students attending the event felt comfortable and safe while sharing their experiences as young people of color,” the campaign admitted afterward. Several establishment journalists criticized the effort to suppress the press at the event. Beto O’Rourke loved to compare President Donald Trump and his presidency to the “Third Reich,” arguing that Trump was just as bad as Hitler. “This idea from Goebbels and Hitler that the bigger the lie and the more often you repeat it, the more likely people are to believe it,” he said in an interview with MSNBC’s Al Sharpton. “That is Donald Trump to a T.” O’Rourke also said that Trump’s political rallies were like an “impromptu Nuremberg rally” like the ones held in Nazi Germany. Despite traveling and campaigning extensively in Iowa, O’Rourke never got much traction in the state. After a mass shooting took place at a Wal-Mart in his home town of El Paso, O’Rourke canceled his events in Iowa and suspended his campaign for a time. When he returned to the trail, O’Rourke scoffed at the “corn dogs and Ferris wheels” campaign optics at the Iowa State Fair and said he would campaign around the entire country instead. “To those places, where Donald Trump has been terrorizing and terrifying and demeaning our fellow Americans, that’s where you will find me in this campaign,” he said. O’Rourke’s support naturally plunged in Iowa, as he was barely polling at one percent before he ended his campaign. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” O’Rourke said during the September debate, sparking American gun owners to dare him to “come and take it.” His remark drew a lot of applause and earned a lot of headlines, and even a campaign t-shirt, but many Democrats, such as fellow 2020 hopeful Mayor Pete Buttigieg, believed that his remarks went too far. “Well, shit,” O’Rourke responded, suggesting that Buttigieg was allowing “triangulating, poll-testing, and focus-groups driving their response.” O’Rourke tried the attack against Buttigieg in the October debate, but it did not go well. At a CNN LGTB+ presidential forum, Beto O’Rourke threatened to end the tax exempt status of churches who continued to oppose same-sex marriage. “There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights, and the full civil rights of every single one of us,” he said in response to a question from CNN’s Don Lemon. Whoops. Beto O’Rourke forgot that the internet was forever, and tried to delete a comment about allowing felons to vote during a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) forum. “HE DELETED THE RESPONSE THAT INCLUDED RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS,” one user revealed, prompting an online uproar. His answer was down-voted by 260 points. That, and trolls accusing him of being a “furry” made the entire event very awkward. 2020 ElectionPolitics2020Beto O'RourkeDonald TrumpEl PasoVanity Fair .

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke ends his presidential campaign; Elizabeth Warren says her health care plan will cost $52 trillion. Former Texas congressman and failed Senate candidate Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke finally acknowledged the obvious Friday when he threw in the towel on his struggling campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination that never really got off the ground. Attention immediately turned to what’s next for the one-time phenom, who has no cushy day job to fall back on. But bowing to reality, an O'Rourke spokesperson told Fox News that O’Rourke has ruled out running for the Senate next year against Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. While O’Rourke’s stock is at rock bottom right now, it was only a year ago he was smashing fundraising records with his $80 million haul in his failed Senate campaign against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN BETO O'ROURKE DROPS OUT OF 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE Political prognosticators speculate about whether Texas – a GOP stronghold for the last generation – will turn blue. If that happens, it would give whoever Democrats nominate for president a major boost because Texas has 38 electoral votes – more than any other state except California. A shift of Texas from red to blue would also have a major impact in determining which political party has majority control in the U.S. House and Senate. The argument about the Lone Star State’s changing political winds goes like this: In 2016, Donald Trump carried the state by a smaller margin than recent Republican presidential candidates. In 2018, Cruz barely eked out a re-election win over O’Rourke. And Democrats knocked off entrenched GOP incumbents in the growing Dallas and Houston suburbs. This year, half a dozen Republican House members have opted not to seek reelection rather than face voters in a deteriorating political climate. The retirements have been so numerous that people refer to them as the Texodus. To be sure, Republicans are wise to keep an eye on Texas. The changing demographics are indisputable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has dubbed Texas “ground zero” for her party. Texas Republicans in previously safe districts – such as Rep. Michael McCaul – are under attack from national liberal groups. But one thing is certain – the next Democrat to win statewide in Texas will not be O’Rourke. Assuming he sticks with plans to not challenge Cornyn, O’Rourke has apparently accepted the fact that his far-left presidential platform has slammed the door shut on his future political prospects in his home state. This year O’Rourke parlayed his national profile toward the White House, ignoring those who would have rather seen him take on Sen. Cornyn, a genial and well-liked Republican. O’Rourke spent much of his presidential campaign apologizing – including for his braggadocio about being “born to be in” the presidential race, for his “white privilege” and for other things. O’Rourke got demolished by fellow Texan and struggling Democratic presidential contender Julian Castro – the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development – in an exchange during the first Democratic presidential debate. Along the way, as he moved further and further to the left, O’Rourke championed radical Democratic policies like the Green New Deal and “Medicare-for-all.” After tragedy struck his hometown of El Paso with a mass shooting Aug. 3, O’Rourke became more outspoken on the issue of gun control. Taking a position that is very unpopular in Texas, where support for gun rights under the Second Amendment is strong, O’Rourke said he favored confiscation of what are commonly (but incorrectly) known as “assault weapons.” ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15,"" O’Rourke said in the September presidential debate. The statement marked a dramatic reversal of O’Rourke’s pledge during his Senate run, when he said that “if you purchased that AR-15, if you own it, keep it, continue to use it responsibly.” With his headline-grabbing debate statement favoring confiscation of firearms, O’Rourke confirmed what Republicans have long accused Democrats of wanting to do. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., predicted the moment “will be played for years” by Second Amendment advocates and hurt the cause of those seeking less drastic gun controls – a sentiment echoed by South Bend., Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another Democratic presidential candidate. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER A Houston Chronicle editorial over the summer begged O’Rourke to “come home” and take on Cornyn. But O’Rourke’s radical positions on gun confiscation and other issues that he staked out in his failed presidential bid have ensured he will not be able to win any statewide political race in Texas. There may yet be a day that Texas becomes more competitive, but it won’t be as soon as the left would like you to believe. And moderate Democrats will have a better chance of election than those on the far-left fringe like O’Rourke. A recent poll showed Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott enjoying a strong 67 percent approval rating – including 65 percent support among Hispanic voters. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Come next November, Abbott’s name will be on the top of the ticket again as he seeks re-election. He is likely to win his race. O’Rourke will be off the ballot and – as losers like to say – he will be able to spend more time with his family.

A Halloween house party in Orinda, California, took an unexpected and dark turn late Thursday night when gunfire erupted and partygoers fled for their lives. The house had been rented on Airbnb, and on Saturday the company's CEO belatedly said enough is enough. ""Starting today, we are banning 'party houses' and we are redoubling our efforts to combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct, including conduct that leads to the terrible events we saw in Orinda,"" wrote Brian Chesky on Twitter. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the party had been advertised on social media as a ""mansion party,"" despite the fact that the Airbnb listing for the property explicitly banned large parties. Noise complaints from neighbors reportedly made their way to the home's owner, Michael Wang, before the shooting. ""We called the police,"" he told the paper. ""They were on the way to go there to stop them, but before we got there, the neighbor already sent us a message saying there was a shooting."" Chesky's decision to ban so-called party houses comes with a new set of enforcement tools — including a ""dedicated 'party house' rapid response team"" — the company hopes will prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future. People renting houses on Airbnb and throwing massive parties is not a new phenomenon — nor are associated shootings. In 2017, a party at an Airbnb in the Bernal Heights neighborhood of San Francisco ended in gunfire. In June of 2019, a house party at an Airbnb in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, also ended in a shooting. In other words, Airbnb has known for years that people rent houses via its platform in order to throw massive parties — often in direct violation of the site's policies. ""We must do better, and we will,"" wrote Chesky. ""This is unacceptable."" Time will tell if the latest effort by Airbnb will stop history from repeating itself, again. More in

News By Sara Dorn Submit November 2, 2019 | 8:27pm				| Updated November 2, 2019 | 8:27pm Disgraced funnyman Louis C.K. should kick off his comedy tour tonight with an apology to survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, Fl., one student activist said. “Louis C.K. can improve and apologize for his words,” Aalayah Eastmond told TMZ, referring to C.K.’s December stand-up routine in which he expressed annoyance with outspoken teens’ gun control advocacy in the wake of the violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. “A simple apology would be a good start.” Eastmond, who acted like she was dead and hid under another student’s body to avoid gunman Nikolas Cruz in the February 2018 shooting, spoke to the gossip site ahead of the comedian’s 14-city comeback tour kicking off Saturday at the Carpenter Theatre in Richmond, Va. C.K. blasted the teens’ anti-gun crusade at the December routine at Governor’s Comedy Club on Long Island. “You’re not interesting because you went to a high school where kids got shot. Why does that mean I have to listen to you?” the stand-up said in leaked audio of the performance published to YouTube. “Why does that make you interesting? You didn’t get shot. You pushed some fat kid in the way, and now I gotta listen to you talking,” C.K. added, as the audience erupted in applause. “They testify in front of Congress, these kids … What are you doing? You’re young, you should be crazy, you should be unhinged. Not in a suit saying, ‘I’m here to tell you … F-–k you,’” he continued. The tour will hit Rome, Detroit and Tel Aviv, before coming to a close in January. It’s C.K.’s first after several women accused him in 2017 of masturbating in front of them and other forms of sexual misconduct. He admitted the allegations were true. Eastmond cautioned attendees that buying a ticket means they’re supporting C.K.’s “harmful words.” “Some advice I would give Louis C.K. is just to be cognizant of people’s experience and their emotions and how that could really affect them,” she said. “At the end of the day, what happened at my school is not something anybody should joke about. It’s not his experience to make a joke about.” Read Next Same-sex love scenes to be restored on Delta in-flight mov... Share Selection This story has been shared 51,016 times.

News By Sara Dorn Submit November 2, 2019 | 9:26pm Airbnb banned the practice of renting to revelers Saturday, following a shooting at a Halloween party held in a home rented through the site. “Starting today, we are banning ‘party houses,’ and we are redoubling our efforts to combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct, including conduct that leads to the terrible events we saw in Orinda,” co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky tweeted Saturday. The announcement follows the deaths of five people in a shooting at a rented house in Orinda, California,, near Oakland. The renter reportedly lied to the homeowner about their intent, claiming they needed the space as a fresh-air refuge from the California wildfire for their asthmatic family members. Instead, the party was advertised on social media, attracting more than 100 guests. Chesky said the company will create “a dedicated ‘party house’ rapid response team” to handle future situations.

46,https://www.gq.com/story/white-house-kids-build-the-wall,"By Luke Darby On October 25, the White House hosted an annual Halloween party at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The EEOB houses the Executive Office of the President, including the vice president's offices, and White House staff in threw the party for the children of executive branch employees and VIP guests, some in the government and some not. Vice president Mike Pence attended the party to make paper airplanes with kids, but other party games were decidedly more controversial. According to Yahoo News, kids were encouraged to build a construction paper wall based on Donald Trump's impractical and environmentally devastating border wall. Per Yahoo News: Large letters on the display spelled out “Build the Wall.” Kids dressed as superheroes and ninjas were given brick-colored paper cards and told to write their name with a marker and tape them to the wall. Alongside the paper wall were signs including one that read “America First,” a slogan often used by President Trump that had been criticized because it was previously employed by the Ku Klux Klan. Construction worker gear was reportedly hung nearby on hooks under a sign that read ""Trump’s Crew."" Despite there being many members of Trump's administration attending, one guest told Yahoo News, ""Horrified. We were horrified."" They requested anonymity, reportedly out of fear of professional retaliation. View on Twitter This isn't the first time the White House has made questionable decisions with children for Halloween events. In 2017, Trump met with the costumed children of reporters who cover the White House, and he repeatedly made derogatory comments about their parents. ""I cannot believe the media produced such beautiful children. How the media did this, I don't know."" Gesturing to the reporters taking photos in the Oval Office, Trump asked the kids, ""Do you know who they are? They are the friendly media."" When he gave candy to one trick-or-treater, a girl dressed as Rey from the latest Star Wars sequels, he said, ""You have no weight problems, that's the good news."" He followed that up with, ""These are beautiful, wonderful children. Are you going to grow up and be like your parents? Mmm, don't answer that. It can only get me in trouble. You have wonderful parents, right?"" By Sean Flynn Since 1957, GQ has inspired men to look sharper and live smarter with its unparalleled coverage of style, culture, and beyond.

Rebranded as 8kun (“kun” and “chan” are both honorific titles in Japanese for you non-weebs out there), the forum now has an important caveat to the no-holds-barred approach to free speech it previously touted, and it’s outlined in plain language on the site’s front page: Anything considered illegal in the United States will be removed. Exactly how many of 8Chan’s millions of former users visited its new iteration today is unclear, but site administrator Ron Watkins, son of 8Chan’s owner and operator Jim Watkins, said in a Youtube video that heavy traffic and cyberattacks were causing significant problems on the site. According to 8Chan’s Twitter, most of the top 25 subforums on 8Chan have been migrated over and they’ve received more than 200 board migration requests. Notably missing among them so far is the /pol/ subforum. Multiple suspected gunmen have posted their manifestos to this board before beginning deadly terrorist acts. 8Chan’s network provider Cloudfare cut ties with the site in August after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, left 20 people dead. The suspected shooter, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted a racist, anti-immigrant manifesto on 8Chan prior to the attack. Livestream footage of the terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand in March was also shared on this subforum. Since August, 8Chan has been struggling to find web services companies that will work with them because of these controversies, though Jim Watkins has continued to defend the site in testimony to Congress and on Youtube. Time will tell whether 8kun proves as much of a cesspool as its predecessor. Word is, the infamous conspiracy theorist QAnon has already made an appearance.

Anonymous internet forum 8chan resurfaced over the weekend after going offline in August following a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. Now named 8kun, the site had 63 active public boards as of Nov. 4. Two days later, however, the rebranded site was back in internet purgatory when its domain registrar pulled the plug. Domain registrar Tucows said N.T. Technology, the parent company of 8kun and 8chan, had violated its services agreement. ""Yesterday, Tucows terminated N.T. Technology, Inc., the reseller for the domains that have hosted the 8chan forum, for violating the terms of the OpenSRS reseller agreement,"" Reg Levy, head of compliance for Tucows, said Nov. 7 in an email. ""The specifics of the breach are a private matter."" (OpenSRS is a domain reseller company owned by Tucows.) Ron Watkins, the site administrator for 8kun, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 8kun returned on Nov. 16 under the new domain 8kun.top. Site owner Jim Watkins tweeted its return on his Twitter account. Please clear your browser cache if you are having trouble accessing 8chan's re-emergence as 8kun and its subsequent disappearance mark the latest twist for a website that has drawn attention for its anything-goes attitude. 8chan had been largely unknown to the public until August, when a gunman allegedly posted a hateful screed to one of its boards before a shooting at an El Paso Walmart killed 22 people and injured 24. That prompted a congressional committee to depose the older Watkins to learn more about how the site works. Security platforms Cloudflare and Voxility pulled their support of 8chan after the shooting, effectively forcing the site to go dark. On Nov. 2, the older Watkins uploaded a video saying the site was doing higher-than-expected traffic after its return. ""It is a fantastic amount of users who attempted to access at one time,"" Watkins said in the video. ""Although I expect setbacks and attacks, it is almost to the point already where no one man, corporation or government will be able to stifle us."" Cybersecurity service and content delivery for the new site is being handled by VanwaTech, based in Vancouver, Washington. On Oct. 30, VanwaTech CEO Nick Lim tweeted about the site's launch. ""I am confident that the team of people operating 8kun have made significant improvements to the operational nature, and moderation of their new website,"" Lim said. ""Free speech, the internet, and the ability to communicate freely and legally, are some of the many pillars that serve as the foundation for America's success both past, present, and future."" Before going offline, 8kun bore a warning telling users not to post content that's illegal in the US. First published Nov. 4.Update, Nov. 7: Adds information about site going offline. Nov. 25: Update on site's return. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate our policy, which we encourage you to read.

News By Lee Brown Submit November 4, 2019 | 12:49pm A 14-year-old boy has been arrested for an Instagram post threatening to shoot up his Florida school on Monday — claiming he did it to get followers and “some laughs,” according to authorities. Ian D’Amico allegedly posted a photo Sunday of four high-powered firearms sitting on a table and bench alongside the warning, “Don’t go to school tomorrow,” Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said in a release. “THIS IS A JOKE. DO NOT REPORT (It’s not a joke),” he added to the post, according to the statement. He was arrested at home in Clearwater after an anonymous tip about the posting late Sunday. Deputies say they soon realized the teen did not own weapons of his own nor have access to any. D’Amico then told deputies the stunt was designed “to get some laughs” — and that he wanted to gain more Instagram followers, the statement said. He was charged him with written threats to kill, do bodily injury or conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism and taken to the Pinellas County Juvenile Assessment Center, the sheriff’s office said.

Former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke’s magic dust was not so magic, Media Buzz host Howie Kurtz told “The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino.” “The pundits essentially drafted this failed Senate candidate into the race. His campaign was always kind of a media creation, and Beto O’Rourke never came close to living up to all the hype,” Kurtz said. O’Rourke announced last week that he is withdrawing from the 2020 presidential race, telling supporters: “it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.” FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN BETO O'ROURKE DROPS OUT OF 2020 PRESIDENTIAL RACE O'Rourke entered the race in March to great fanfare after nearly defeating Texas incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterms, but he struggled to gain traction in the massive Democratic primary field. BETO O'ROURKE 'VANITY FAIR' PROFILE MOCKED FOR STORIES ABOUT EX-GIRLFRIENDS, BOOKSHELVES AND HIS 'NEAR-MYTHICAL EXPERIENCE' “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,” O’Rourke wrote in a post on Medium. “Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee, and it is in the best interests of the country.” Kurtz said that O’Rourke’s campaign was disorganized and never stood for anything other than his personal charisma and gun control.

56,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/milwaukee-acid-attack-victim.html,"Advertisement Supported by Mahud Villalaz, a U.S. citizen who received second-degree burns to his face, recalled his attacker saying, “You came here to invade.” By John Ismay The police in Milwaukee on Monday were investigating an attack on a Hispanic man as a possible hate crime after the victim, who was severely burned on his face and neck, reported that his attacker threw acid on him and told him to “go back to your country.” The victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, was assaulted outside a Mexican restaurant in the Lincoln Village neighborhood of Milwaukee on Friday. He described being attacked by a white man who hurled racist insults at him and accused him of being an “illegal” before splashing acid on him. The police said they had arrested a 61-year-old white man in connection with the attack, but as of Monday night they had not announced any charges nor released the suspect’s identity. Mr. Villalaz, an American citizen who came to the United States from Peru 19 years ago, said the episode began when he parked near the taqueria and was confronted by the man about how close his pickup truck was to a bus stop. Mr. Villalaz returned to his vehicle and moved it about a block away. As he walked toward the restaurant again, he said, the man said, “You came here to invade.” A nearby surveillance camera captured video of the attack, showing a man splashing a liquid onto the left side of Mr. Villalaz’s face. Mr. Villalaz said he rushed into the restaurant’s bathroom and rinsed his face with water, which may have lessened his injuries. The police described the liquid only as a “corrosive substance,” though Mr. Villalaz said doctors told him they thought it was battery acid and it also burned a jacket, sweater and shirt he was wearing. Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee and members of the city’s Hispanic community said they were alarmed by the attack and were worried that statements made by President Trump had cultivated an anti-immigrant sentiment. “This anger towards people from other countries is being fed by our president and by his followers,” Mr. Barrett, a Democrat, told reporters on Monday. “What we saw over the weekend is a manifestation of that anger.” “The victim is a United States citizen,” Mr. Barrett added. “He has as much right to be here as any one of us.” Darryl Morin, the president of Forward Latino, an advocacy group based in the Milwaukee area, said, “Sadly this is following the pattern we’re seeing nationwide,” citing the mass shooting in which Hispanics were targeted in El Paso, Texas, as the most horrifying example. The attacker’s reported use of the word “invade” was particularly troubling, Mr. Morin said, given Mr. Trump’s public warnings of an “invasion” by immigrants on America’s southwestern border — language also echoed by the El Paso suspect. Mr. Trump also told a group of four minority Democratic congresswomen to “go back” to their countries this summer. “What we are seeing is not just an attack on immigrants, it’s an attack on all Hispanics,” Mr. Morin said. “It’s an attack on America as a whole.” According to José G. Pérez, who represents Lincoln Village and seven nearby neighborhoods on the City Council, the area around the attack is overwhelmingly Hispanic and has been attracting new businesses. “Latinos are the backbone of population growth in the city and in the district,” he said. Mr. Villalaz was treated at a hospital for second-degree burns on his face and third-degree burns on his neck, as well as irritation to his left eye. He was recovering at home on Monday. Mr. Morin, whose organization has been providing assistance to Mr. Villalaz, said the victim and his family were comforted somewhat by the arrest of a suspect, and grateful for the efforts of the Milwaukee Police Department. An online campaign to raise funds for Mr. Villalaz’s medical expenses has already exceeded its goal of $15,000. Mr. Villalaz, the father of two young boys — Alain, 7, and Aayden, 5 — said the attack had been hard on his sons. “The younger one started crying and said, ‘Why would somebody do this to you, Daddy, when you did nothing to him?’” he said. “How do you explain this to a little boy?” “But my older son understands a little better. He said, ‘It was crazy people out there.’” Amy Osorio contributed reporting.

58,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/608770120/0/phoenix/nation~What-Tuesdays-elections-could-tell-us-a-year-before-Trump-faces-the-voters/,"WASHINGTON – Voters around the country began voting today in a series of state and municipal elections that could provide some insight into the nation's political mood heading into the 2020 election. Gubernatorial races in Kentucky and Mississippi, where President Donald Trump has made campaign stops in recent days to bolster Republican candidates, top the slate of off-year contests. But state legislative races in Mississippi, Louisiana, New Jersey and Virginia – where Democrats have a legitimate shot to wrest away power from the GOP for the first time in two decades – are also being watched for signs of voter sentiment about the president. At a rally in Kentucky Monday for GOP Gov. Matt Bevin's re-election campaign, Trump said a loss would send ""a really bad message."" ""If you win (the media) are going to make it like ho-hum, and if you lose they're going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world,"" he said. ""You can't let that happen to me."" Turnout has been steady in Kentucky with only a few problems reported, while voting in Mississippi was described as ""healthy,"" according to news reports. The president has tried to push GOP gubernatorial candidates over the finish line while staying clear of Republicans’ efforts to hold onto their narrow majority in the Virginia state legislature – all while fighting a growing impeachment inquiry in Washington. “There is no getting away from what is happening nationally, even in these off-year elections,” said Page Gardner, president of the Voter Participation Center, which tries to increase engagement among unmarried women, young people and people of color. “At the end of the day, whatever you say, you’re running in an operating environment that is being defined by his presidency.” Here’s a look at what to watch for when the results come in. Bevin is the best example of a Trump proxy on the ballot today. Besides sharing Trump’s pugilistic style, Bevin has also tied himself closely to Trump. “Matt’s proudly pro-life, against sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants and against impeaching our president,” says one of Bevin’s ads that ends with him waving from Air Force One with Trump. Bevin has traveled multiple times to the White House, taken a live call from Trump during a news conference in Kentucky, and leaned into the impeachment issue the most among the Republicans running for governor this year. Trump spent election eve campaigning for Bevin in Kentucky, a state the president carried by nearly 30 points. Democrats say Bevin had no choice but to run on Trump’s coattails after his criticism of teachers and the actions he’s taking on health care and public employee pensions have made him one of the nation’s most unpopular governors. “I’m still a Donald Trump guy, but I’m done with Bevin,” Kentuckian Dennis Boehm says in an ad for the Democrat, Attorney General Andy Beshear. The race could show whether there’s a limit to Trump’s popularity or to his ability to transfer that popularity, said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections, which analyzes races. “I think Kentucky is a test of whether a connection to the president is enough to smooth over other faults,” he said. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, won’t find out his fate this week. After he failed to win a majority of the votes in the October “jungle primary,” Edwards faces Republican businessman Eddie Rispone in a Nov. 16 runoff. In the primary, Edwards performed better than he had four years ago in the areas that included the state's two largest cities as well as the suburbs of New Orleans. But he did worse in many rural areas. That trend of rural America and small cities getting more Republican while bigger cities and suburbs become more Democratic was also apparent in a North Carolina special election for a congressional seat in September. And as voting patterns become more intensely partisan, Democrats could find it harder to win votes in states like Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana where Trump is popular. A candidate with Edwards’ approval rating and track record would have been easily re-elected 20 years ago, said Kyle Kondik, who analyzes elections at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “But in this era, where party label is so much more meaningful and politics are so nationalized, even at the state level, it gets harder,” he said. That’s the same situation facing Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, the only Democrat there holding a statewide office, who is running to become governor. Hood faces Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves in the race to succeed the GOP governor, who is term limited. “I bait my own hook, carry my own gun and drive my own truck,” Hood boasts in an ad highlighting the culturally conservative persona that used to allow some Democrats to win Republican states. Democrats say that the fact that all three governors races are close shows that they can compete anywhere with the right candidates focused on local issues. Republicans say those states’ histories of electing Democrats at the state level is still fairly recent and a clean sweep by the GOP of all three would be unprecedented. The battle is just starting for the brawl that will explode next year in state legislative races as the parties try to put themselves in the best position for redrawing state and federal legislative maps after the 2020 Census. “We got caught off-guard in 2010. The Republicans routed us,” said Matt Harringer, spokesman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. “Democrats have learned their lesson.” The party and their allies are outspending Republicans in today’s showdown for control of the Virginia legislature, the only state with legislative races on the ballot where party control could flip. (Republicans are hoping to maintain their supermajority in Mississippi and gain a supermajority in Louisiana. Democrats should hold their supermajority in New Jersey’s lower house.) In Virginia, Democrats are trying to build on their huge gains in 2017 when they came tantalizingly close to winning the legislature in a state that has become increasingly blue. “Does that trend in Virginia continue, or do Democrats stall out a little bit in what’s going to be a lower turnout election?” asked Kondik of the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Most of the major Democratic presidential candidates have traveled to Virginia to keep the momentum going. Republicans, however, sent Vice President Mike Pence – and not Trump – across the river for a pre-election push. “Virginia Republicans have built a wall at the Potomac to keep Donald Trump out,"" Harringer said. Trump lost Virginia by 5 percentage points in 2019 and his approval rating is under water there. In the mirror opposite of the situation in the Kentucky governor’s race, Republicans complain that Virginia Democrats only want to talk about Trump and impeachment while their candidates are focusing on local issues. Quentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, compares Trump’s role in the election to an omnipresent force below the surface of the debate. “When there’s sort of a strong, steady wind, people don’t talk about the wind, but everything they do when they’re outside is affected by the wind,” he said. “The undertone of all of (Democrats’) campaigns in competitive races has been about sending this message of disapproval. Republicans have wanted to localize elections as much as possible.” Gun violence has played an outsized role in the legislative elections in Virginia, a state that suffered the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech and the May shooting that left a dozen dead in Virginia Beach. The Republican speaker of the House, Kirk Cox, is being challenged by a woman whose daughter survived a 2016 shooting. The Democrat challenging the Republican state senator who represents Virginia Beach ran an ad featuring a woman who was in the city building there when the shooter attacked. “I was lucky, but not everyone was,” Karen Havekost says in the ad, before criticizing state Sen. Bill DeSteph for not doing enough to address gun violence. The ad was partially paid for by Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, which has outspent the Virginia-based National Rifle Association in the elections. Austin Chambers, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, said Democrats are taking advantage of the tragedy by politicizing it to fire up their base in a low-turnout election. “I think, for the most part, Democrats have overplayed their hands,” he said. “They’ve tried to make this entire election about gun control.” Kidd, the professor at Christopher Newport University, said if DeSteph is defeated in Virginia Beach, that could have national implications. “Virginia Beach is a big suburban city that looks a lot like western Philly suburbs, the eastern Denver suburbs, the eastern Kansas City suburbs,” Kidd said. “If gun control, gun safety is going to play in 2020, we’ll see how well (it will) in this particular Senate race.” Health care, the issue that provided much of the wind in the sails of Democrats in the 2018 election, was also a top topic in gubernatorial and legislative races. Edwards’ expansion of Medicaid in Louisiana was the signature accomplishment of his first term and he’s hammering his GOP challenger for calling for a “freeze” to check whether those enrolled actually qualify. In Mississippi, Hood – the Democratic candidate – has promised to expand Medicaid while the Republican would not. In Kentucky, Beshear wants to undo changes Bevin made to Medicaid, which was expanded under Beshear’s father when he was governor. Bevin has required that some adults prove they are working to get benefits and has threatened to end the expansion if a court challenge to those requirements is successful. In the Virginia legislative races, the state’s recent Medicaid expansion is so popular that even some Republicans who had opposed it are running on their support for expansion. “It’s a phenomenal change,” Kidd said. But Republicans are also playing offense on health care. An ad in the Kentucky governor’s race shows Democratic presidential candidates raising their hands during one of the presidential debates when asked whether they would provide insurance to immigrants who are in the country illegally. Another ad by the Republican Governors Association, this one in Louisiana, also shows the Democratic debate stage while referencing some of the presidential candidates’ support for Medicare for All. “Washington Democrats want a full government takeover of health care,” the ad says. “But John Bel Edwards has already started.” Both sides are using this year’s elections to get ready for 2020. They’re testing messaging, voter registration encouragement and techniques to get voters to the polls. One big focus of the Republican National Committee is expanding its grassroots organization. They’ve trained 22,000 people this year, moving toward their goal of having 60,000 ready to mobilize for next year’s elections. They’d only trained 5,000 during the 2016 cycle. And a “national week of action” held in the runup to today’s election includes a dry run of their get-out-the-vote effort. One of the most active groups on the Democratic side is the political action committee Priorities USA. They launched in September a $4 million campaign targeting voters in the 2020 presidential battleground states of Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. The activities help the group figure out which techniques are most effective while also getting voters in the habit of going to the polls so they’re more likely to show up in 2020. Many mayoral races in the bigger cities have already taken place, with Democrats increasing their dominance by picking up seats in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Montgomery, Alabama. Steven Reed will be the first African American to represent Alabama’s majority-black capital, a city known as the birthplace of the civil rights movement. Montgomery was one of only three Deep South cities with a population of 100,000 or more that had never elected an African American as mayor. African Americans are also succeeding white mayors in Chicago and Dallas. An African American woman lost to a younger, white male challenger in New Haven, Connecticut, an example of a growing number of Democratic primary challenges to mayors. The number of openly gay women running cities of 100,000 or more increased from two to five with the elections of LGBTQ candidates in Chicago, Madison and Tampa. Republicans say their best chance for pickups today are in Aurora, Colorado, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. Despite Democrats’ control of the majority of the nation’s largest cities, the spokesman for the Republicans' group for mayors and city council members said the party’s not deterred because politics is cyclical. “That’s the kind of the season that we’re in right now,” said Ben Cannatti, political and communications director for Community Leaders of America. “Eventually the Democrat leadership falls by the wayside and voters look for an alternative.” Contributing: Ledyard King",2019-11-05 01:05:05,What Tuesday's elections could tell us a year before Trump faces the voters,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Super Stickers are little cartoon characters that fans can purchase to show their support for a streamer. The stickers on YouTube are not customizable, however, like many emotes on Twitch are. The product is launching today in 60 countries for creators who are over 18 years old and have monetized channels with more than 1,000 subscribers. The company first announced Super Stickers during its annual keynote at VidCon, a convention for creators and fans held in Anaheim, California. There are eight sticker packs available at launch, five of which will feature animated cartoons. Those animated cartoons come with unique messages to help fans connect with creators. A few of the stickers can be seen below. YouTube decided to implement the stickers after seeing the success of Super Chat, its Twitch-like tool that allows people to purchase better placement for their messages to streamers. More than 100,000 channels use Super Chat, according to the company, with some creators earning more than $400 a minute. It hasn’t all been positive, though. YouTube has faced backlash for allowing people to earn revenue from Super Chat while using hateful language or imagery. There are multiple examples of Super Chat being used to promote hateful ideologies, including a report from The Wall Street Journal that found people paying to boast anti-Semitic comments on a live stream hosted by far-right personality Ethan Ralph following a mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue. YouTube’s policy states that if a Super Chat is “removed for violating our policies, YouTube will donate our portion of revenue to charity.” There are only a select number of Super Stickers available at launch, but the company is planning to release more in the coming months.

It’s worth tracking how much enthusiasm President Donald Trump manages to generate among Republicans and white working-class voters, as well as to what extent Democratic candidates energize suburban and none-white voters, the analysts said. Trump campaigned Monday night for Republican Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, who is in a tight race against Democrat Andy Beshear, and the president also has sent out tweets in support of Virginia Republicans, who are trying to preserve their slim majority in the state legislature’s two chambers. Trump also has campaigned for Louisiana Republican gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone, who is running against incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, though Louisiana’s runoff election isn’t on Tuesday, but rather Nov. 16. Here are five things to watch as results from Tuesday’s elections roll in. If Democrats flip both chambers of Virginia’s legislature, they would be running three key arms of the state’s government for the first time in 25 years, as Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam still has two years left to his term after surviving his blackface-photo scandal. Virginia has turned increasingly blue in recent years, with Hillary Clinton carrying the state in 2016.

      could be affected by Virginia’s election results on Tuesday. The gun debate is playing a big role following a May mass shooting in Virginia Beach — and after the Republican-controlled legislature shut down a special session on gun-control measures in July. If Bevin loses in his re-election bid in Kentucky’s gubernatorial contest, Trump said on Monday that pundits “will say Trump suffered the greatest defeat ever.” “You can’t let that happen to me,” the president said at an election eve rally at the storied home of the University of Kentucky’s basketball team. A Mason-Dixon poll last month showed Bevin and Beshear tied, with each at 46% support. Beshear, the state’s attorney general, is the son of Steve Beshear, who served as the state’s Democratic governor immediately before Bevin. “This is Trump’s safe zone, nationalizing campaigns for Republicans in need of help in deep red states,” Beacon’s analysts said. Related: Poll focused on battleground states finds Trump leading Warren, but trailing Biden And see: ‘You have to vote for me’ or stock market will crash, Trump says at rally Trump also has waded into the governor’s race in Mississippi, holding a rally on Friday night for GOP candidate Tate Reeves, the state’s lieutenant governor. While Mississippi is a red state, Reeves is facing the tightest governor’s race in decades, battling against Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. A Mason-Dixon poll last month found Reeves ahead of Hood by just 3 percentage points. Mississippians are also selecting state legislators on Tuesday, but the legislature isn’t expected to flip. Voters in some localities and states are also deciding Tuesday on ballot measures, including a New York City plan for ranked-choice voting. With ranked-choice voting, people mark not only their first choice in a race, but also their second, third and sometimes fourth choices. As some big investors worry about the nation’s polarization, supporters of this approach to voting say it can reduce polarization because it forces candidates to broaden their appeal. Opponents maintain it can confuse voters. More than two decades after Washington state’s voters banned affirmative-action programs, they’re casting ballots on the issue again. Voters there have been tasked with choosing whether to keep a measure approved this spring by the state’s legislature that reinstates affirmative action, the Seattle Times writes.

    -  Nov 5, 2019 6:16 pm UTC 8chan was back online this week—albeit with a new name—three months after the site was essentially kicked off the public Internet. 8Chan is now called 8kun and located at 8kun.net. (In Japanese, ""chan"" is generally an honorific for children while ""kun"" is generally an honorific for young adults.) We were able to access the site this morning, but it's offline again now around mid-day. 8chan administrator Ron Watkins previously warned that DDoS attacks and people protesting against 8chan's re-emergence could cause problems. ""Not sure how long we will be able to stay online with clearnet due to activists trying to deplatform us, and hackers preparing to ddos us. The tor hidden service should remain available regardless,"" Watkins wrote on Twitter Saturday. 8kun was also available on Loki, which Watkins described as an experimental alternative to Tor. 8kun is using Tucows as its registrar, and a Vice report says that 8kun's hosting service is the Russia-based Media Land LLC. Media Land was recently described as a ""bulletproof hosting service"" by security reporter Brian Krebs. It's not clear if the 8kun administrators found a full replacement for Cloudflare's anti-DDoS services. ""We have been under sustained attacks the past few days and doing everything we can to get things stable again,"" Watkins wrote on Twitter today, shortly before the site went down again. ""The site is still online—albeit limping along—as we reorganize and restructure to deflect attacks coming from many angles."" 8chan founder Fredrick Brennan, who quit the site and now advocates against it, wrote on Twitter today that ""8kun's host is best known for hosting ransomware and phishing websites."" 8kun was using an unallocated IP address, ""which is if not illegal, [an] extremely bad practice that many ISPs... shun,"" Brennan wrote. These are also known as ""bogon"" or bogus IP addresses. Cloudflare cut 8chan off in early August after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that killed 22 people. The accused shooter had apparently posted a racist manifesto on 8chan just before the attack. 8chan was previously used similarly by perpetrators of attacks at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and a synagogue in Poway, California. ""8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate,"" Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince wrote when he announced his decision to stop providing services to the site. ""They have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,"" Prince also wrote. ""Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit."" 8chan temporarily got back online in early August, shortly after losing Cloudflare service. 8chan switched its website to a provider called BitMitigate, the same company that began serving the Daily Stormer after Cloudflare cut it off. But that didn't last long, either, as BitMitigate's cloud infrastructure provider decided to shut off BitMitigate's service. 8chan owner Jim Watkins testified to Congress in September, claiming that 8chan was ""offline voluntarily"" and would come back online when it ""is able to develop additional tools to counter illegal content under United States law."" Watkins said 8chan takes action to remove child pornography and ""true threats,"" but it ""has no intention of deleting constitutionally protected hate speech.""

Oct. 11, 2018: Rapper Kanye West listens to a question from a reporter during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump in Washington. On Sunday, Aug. 25, 2019, Kanye West hosted a Sunday Service in Ohio in support of those affected by the recent mass shooting. A large crowd gathered at the service in a park in Dayton. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) On most Sunday mornings, beneath the celestial force of the Southern California sunshine, Kanye West and a congregation of celebrities trek toward the hills near Hollywood, singing, dancing, repenting and reveling in their shared energy. It’s an invitation-only affair, known as the rap megastar's “Sunday Services,” and admission is the hottest ticket in town. Part concert and part religious service, the West-led worships include dancers and a full choir. Weekly clips emerge on social media depicting congregants moving to the gospel sounds of such songs as “Lift Yourself” and “Jesus Walks.” April 20, 2019: Kanye West performing at the Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. West has unveiled his “Jesus Is King” IMAX film featuring a gospel choir performing at artist James Turrell’s dramatic Roden Crater in the Arizona desert. West showed the 35-minute film off to fans at an event Wednesday night at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif. (Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File) But what’s the business and branding behind the bethel? “If this is a sincere move to offer Christian love to those in need, then it is for sure a useful way to encourage people,” said Rev. Ryan Rose, associate pastor at Evangel Temple in Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Fox News. “If this is a business plan or an avenue to promote his name, it would be a tragic exploitation of faith and those hurting.” In addition to the famous Kardashian and Jenner clans, the event has attracted the likes of A$AP Rocky – right after his jail release – Travis Scott, Scooter Braun, 2 Chainz, DMX, Lizzo, Donald Glover, Kid Cudi, Teyana Taylor, Jaden Smith, Justin Bieber, Gwen Stefani, Idris Elba, Paris Jackson, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt and Courtney Love. The location in and around Hollywood changes almost weekly, including both indoor and outdoor spaces. West also takes his services on the road and recently opened up the event to the public. The service is free, but attendees generally have to snap up a ticket in advance, given the immense popularity that has thousands vying for a coveted patch of the earth below the West pew. KANYE WEST, DAVE CHAPPELLE BRING SUNDAY SERVICE TO DAYTON, OHIO, FOLLOWING MASS SHOOTING Earlier this year, West made headlines when he held an Easter Sunday Service at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the parched and picturesque desert of Indio, Calif. The jam session was live-streamed through a peephole camera. Still, much about the private services remains murky, as guests are mandated to sign nondisclosure agreements, according to Variety magazine. And even though the services are free and West does not take an offering, they seem to provide West with at least an indirect financial gain. His new, gospel-themed album was released last month and immediately soared to the top spot on the Billboard charts. More than a month earlier, he updated his website with a curious image, which his wife Kim Kardashian West also tweeted. It cryptically featured a Bible open to the Book of Psalms, poised beside a notepad inscribed with an apparent album title and tracklist, in addition to the proposed release date of late September. The marketing mystery of the religious album dragged on for an additional month before the record, his ninth studio album, finally dropped on Oct. 25. “Jesus is King” features several religious-themed tracks, including “God Is,” “Use This Gospel,” “Follow God” and “Jesus Is Lord.” So, is Kanye saving souls, selling records or both? “Sunday Services are an amazingly innovative way for Kanye to express himself,"" observed Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5WPR. ""Like any great artist-entrepreneur, he is taking that opportunity to turn his passion into a new revenue stream. ""It makes sense. Whether it started intentionally or not, this is another extremely innovative way for Kanye to stay in the news cycle, expand his audience, and grow his brand – as well as his bank account.” Over the summer, it was revealed that Mascotte Holdings, which has filed for trademarks at West’s behest in the past, applied for “Sunday Service” in reference to shirts, scarves, socks, loungewear, and pants. The move has sparked speculation about how exactly the rap star and fashion designer intends to leverage his growing popularity as a spiritual leader. STARS SLAM KANYE WEST'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, CALL IT 'HELL ON EARTH' In connection with his Coachella showdown, West peddled associated merchandise – socks, sweatpants, and apparel ranging from $50 to $250, emblazoned with slogans such as “Church Socks” and “Jesus Walks.” After a sharp and substantial backlash to the high-priced products, the online website went dark. Kardashian-West told Elle magazine earlier this year that it wasn’t precisely a church, but rather, “more like a healing experience” for her husband. “It’s just music; there is no sermon. It’s definitely something he believes in – Jesus, and there is a Christian vibe,” the reality star said. “But there’s no preaching. It’s just a very spiritual Christian experience.” West has made no secret of the demons he has battled personally and professionally. In 2016, he canceled a profitable tour and sought medical treatment for temporary psychosis. But in an episode of his wife’s long-running reality show “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” which aired in June, the “Gold Digger” singer confessed that he always wanted to open a church of his own. That could – at some point in the future – lend itself to a step toward charity status. “To be tax-exempt, an entity, which cannot be owned by individuals, must be formed for charitable or religious purposes,” explained Beverly Hills-based entertainment attorney Julian Chan. “But some still manage to do well by paying large salaries or directing benefits to related entities, using persons who appear disinterested but may act as friends.” Chan also noted that while the trademark application does point to a connection to commercialization, it doesn’t mean West is not sincere in encouraging others to explore the Christian faith. “They are not exclusive,” he said. “We have seen many people explore faith, but still positively influence others.” But for now, there is no minister. And there is no apparent paperwork filed to establish any sort of non-profit religious institution. Moreover, Rose noted that if he is running religious services and operating as a Christianity ministry, there should not be any roadblocks in becoming a non-profit. “Ultimately, if his Sunday Services are going to continue, and this becomes something of a church, movement or denomination, I think it would be wise for him and his team to develop a spiritual guidance or accountability board so that there would be sound theology and practices in place,” Rose said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And in an era and industry where faith is often frowned upon, West might just be reviving Christianity in a way that comes across as cool among the Tinseltown crowd. “Celebrities have been told, for decades, to cover up their religious beliefs out of fear of polarizing audiences,” said Jeetendr Sehdev, a celebrity branding expert. “It’s great that Kanye is putting his faith front and center, and showing us what really matters to him. It’s a brave and unapologetic move that should be lauded. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2021 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

66,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/army-times/news/your-army/~3/K0D_op2cd8g/,"Tuesday marks the 10-year anniversary of the attack at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 people dead and more than 30 wounded. On Nov. 5, 2009, Maj. Nidal Hasan, 39, entered a readiness processing center on post and opened fire using a handgun fitted with a laser sight on unarmed soldiers and civilians preparing for deployments. Hasan, then an Army psychiatrist, was also due to deploy to Afghanistan. He was ultimately convicted during a court-martial in August 2013 of 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted murder. He is one of four death row inmates in the military justice system, awaiting execution at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks on Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Hasan’s shooting spree sparked a conversation about the difference between attacks sponsored by terror organizations and those that are simply “inspired” by such groups, a distinction underscored roughly five years later as ISIS-inspired attacks rose in frequency. Vice President Mike Pence spoke to troops at Fort Hood on Oct. 29 and visited a memorial to those killed in the shooting.

And I was deeply moved — moved by the tributes to all of those that were lost.” “Like Staff Sgt. Amy Krueger, who was preparing for a tour of duty in Afghanistan before that fateful day,” Pence added. “Or Spc. Jason Dean Hunt, who had just gotten married two months before. Or Pfc. Francheska Velez, who had just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq and was expecting her first child.” Those killed in the attack: The victims of the shooting were awarded Purple Hearts in 2015, after an intervention by Congress. Legislators added an amendment to the 2015 defense spending bill that extended Purple Heart eligibility to attacks in which an individual “was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack,” and was “inspired or motivated” by a terror group. Hasan was known to be in communication with the Yemeni-American imam Anwar al-Awlaki, an infamous al-Qaida propagandist, prior to carrying out his attack. Awlaki never gave Hasan any explicit directives and the Army major’s radicalization likely began earlier than his emails with the cleric, according to a 2018 review of Hasan’s case by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. Awlaki was ultimately killed by drone-launched Hellfire missiles in September 2011. During his visit to Fort Hood last week, Pence also addressed the families of those killed in the attack and the more than 30 wounded survivors. “The American people are with you, and this nation will never forget or fail to honor the service and sacrifice of our heroes who fell on November 5, 2009,"" Pence said.

@RobinSimcox Robin Simcox is the Margaret Thatcher Fellow at The Heritage Foundation. Almost as soon as it became clear that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead, the revisionism began about whether this was actually a good thing. Some analysts predicted that al-Baghdadi’s death as a “martyr” would inspire others, becoming a “propaganda bonanza” for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. We should not be so gloomy. The death of such a sadistic killer and serial rapist is unambiguously good news. It was also the last thing that ISIS needed. Caliphate relinquished, the group’s operations inevitably will be disrupted by the death of its emir, especially with Abu Hassan al-Muhajir—a potential successor—killed in a U.S. airstrike just hours later. Still, the demise of the Islamic State’s “caliph” does not mean the fight against Islamist terrorism is over; far from it. As the dust settles on the al-Baghdadi raid, here are five things to look out for in the days and weeks ahead. Firstly, to what extent was the intelligence gleaned from the al-Baghdadi compound sufficient to roll up other ISIS networks? President Donald Trump stated that “we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS’ origins, future plans” during the raid. It is unclear whether Abu Hassan’s death was linked to the al-Baghdadi intelligence haul, but we should look for signs of the U.S. and its allies across the world hitting ISIS hard in the weeks to come. Secondly, and conversely, we should be cognizant of the possibility of reprisal attacks in the West but not necessarily expect them. Already we have heard pundits speculate about “more attacks within coming days and weeks, as a retaliation for this very high-profile killing.” It can happen: Omar Mateen, the ISIS-inspired shooter who killed 49 and wounded 53 at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016, told police negotiators that his attack was “triggered” by a U.S. airstrike that killed Abu Wahib, a senior ISIS figure, just weeks earlier. This may or may not be true, but as a general rule of thumb, when terrorists say they are doing something for a specific reason, it is often worth treating it seriously. However, we heard similar concerns about reprisal attacks when Osama bin Laden was killed (“Fears of al-Qaeda vengeance after U.S. kills Osama,” warned Reuters) and the same with Anwar al-Awlaki (“‘Revenge’ Strike Feared After al-Awlaki’s death, cautioned ABC News). Those fears turned out to be unfounded, and reprisals for al-Baghdadi’s death are unlikely as well. Believing that ISIS will look to majorly step up its attack planning now implicitly suggests that it has been pulling its punches so far. That’s a rather dubious suggestion. If ISIS can strike in the West, it will, regardless of the strength of al-Baghdadi’s pulse. Thirdly, how does al-Baghdadi’s death affect the future of ISIS strategically? As Hassan Hassan pointed out in The New York Times, ISIS is currently “caught somewhere between being a proto-state and a full-fledged insurgency” in Syria and Iraq. Reconstituting the caliphate in Iraq and Syria is a nonstarter for ISIS in the short term, which means it will surely have to revert to its insurgent roots. Hassan also suspects that the jihad will become increasingly localized following the fall of the caliphate, with less focus on Western attacks. This is certainly a possibility; attacks in the West are certainly down from their 2016-17 peak. Yet vigilance is still required. A U.N. Security Council report from earlier this year noted “the revival of links between individuals in various European countries” and ISIS’ leadership. Internal ISIS files discovered in Syria by The (London) Sunday Times earlier this year also hinted at ISIS having more command and control capacity than sometimes assumed. Fourth, can ISIS remain unified? That ISIS’ affiliates across the globe will remain loyal to al-Baghdadi’s eventual successor is not a given. As terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross pointed out to Voice of America, “The standard bayat [pledge of allegiance] is not to an organization … Bayat is on an individual to individual level.” Al-Baghdadi’s death is not guaranteed to lead to division—after all, al-Qaeda global affiliates stayed the course despite bin Laden’s death—but it is possible. Fifth, what does this mean for al-Qaeda and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri? There is certainly an opportunity for al-Qaeda to exploit the problems that ISIS is very clearly currently facing by recruiting disillusioned fighters and fundraising off the back of ISIS’ failure to sustain the caliphate (as al-Qaeda warned it would). A possible ISIS and al-Qaeda merger remains speculated upon—speculation not quelled by the discovery that al-Baghdadi was being sheltered in Idlib by a commander in Hurras al-Din, the Syrian group operated by al-Qaeda loyalists—but remains a long shot. However, al-Baghdadi’s death also shines the spotlight more brightly on al-Qaeda’s leader. The U.S. nearly snagged al-Zawahiri on at least one occasion: The CIA narrowed his location down to a specific village in North Waziristan in the 2012-13 period. Now, with al-Baghdadi gone, al-Zawahiri reverts to being the most high-profile terrorist left and also perhaps the one with the most obvious name recognition in the U.S. That should matter to us if for no other reason than that it matters to Trump. As he stated: From the first day I came to office … I would say, ‘Where’s al-Baghdadi? I want al-Baghdadi.’ And we would kill terrorist leaders, but they were names I never heard of, they were names that weren’t recognizable and they weren’t the big names … I kept saying, ‘Where’s al-Baghdadi?’ The threat from ISIS and groups like it will remain pronounced. We have become used to that and to reports of the latest suicide bombing, mass shooting, or vehicular attack perpetrated by al-Baghdadi’s acolytes. The past week has been a welcome change: one in which it has been almost exclusively bad news for ISIS. That cannot last. There will certainly be darker weeks ahead in this fight. But al-Baghdadi’s timely death at least presents an opportunity to make some headway in winning it.

    -  Nov 5, 2019 11:00 pm UTC The successor to 8chan, 8kun, made a somewhat brief appearance on the public Internet thanks to what amounts to an attack on the Internet's routing infrastructure. The site's domain name server, hosted by a service called VanwaNet, offered up an Internet address for the site that was from an unallocated set of addresses belonging to the RIPE Network Coordinating Centre, the regional Internet registry authority for Europe and the Middle East. And the host for the new site, the Russian hosting company Media Land LLC, advertised a route to that address to the rest of the Internet, allowing visitors to reach the site for a while. The advertisement of the address, made with the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), is what is referred to in the routing world as a ""bogon"" or ""martian."" Usually these happen when private network addresses mistakenly are sent out, or ""advertised,"" from a network to the rest of the Internet because of a router misconfiguration. But sometimes, they hijack existing addresses either accidentally or maliciously. A BGP ""leak"" in November 2018 caused Google and Spotify service outages. In 2015, for example, Hacking Team used a BGP bogon advertisement to help Italian police regain control of infrastructure used to monitor hacked targets. And a Russian network provider made BGP advertisements that hijacked traffic to financial services sites in 2017. While 8kun.net was registered in September through Tucows, the actual process was handled by a company called N.T. Technology Inc., a hosting company and registration services provider that appears to have gone dark in August, around the same time 8Chan went offline. The domain for N.T. Technology was registered by Jim Watkins—the ""owner"" of 8chan. And several hosts associated with 8chan, on the 8ch.net domain, were hosted by N.T. Technology. None of N.T. Technology's servers appears to be reachable. The Twitter account associated with the company (which gives the location as Carson City, Nevada) has been inactive since 2014. The address given for the company on its now-dead website was a Digital Real Estate data center in San Francisco, and its corporate office address was that of a corporation registration and virtual home office company in Reno, Nevada. The phone number associated with the Reno address in domain registration data was disconnected; a second number (a Comcast VoIP number) went unanswered. But the company's network is still active, based on data from Hurricane Electric's BGP tools. After 8chan lost its hosting in August in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting, much of 8chan's content—especially the ""pol"" channel—had shifted to the social media platform Telegram  (known for its anti-censorship policies, which have made it a haven for all flavors of extremism). Telegrampol, for instance, was set up in July. But the fragmented nature of the Telegram channels (and the Telegram architecture) likely kept away many 8chan users; Telegrampol has a total of 633 subscribers. 8kun was an effort to restore a central location for all of 8chan's communities, but it faced the same challenges in hosting that brought down 8chan in the first place—its radioactivity to hosting providers and domain registrars. This is what apparently drove Watkins and company to a rather unusual hosting option: a Russian company known mostly for hosting crimeware. Media Land is operated by Alexander Volosovyk, known as ""Yahlishanda"" on criminal underground Internet marketplaces. According to a report by Brian Krebs, Volosovyk is the world's biggest ""bulletproof"" hosting operator. He has, according to Krebs, avoided takedowns and prosecution by operating carefully within the lines of the law in Russia and other former Soviet states. Servers hosted by Media Land infrastructure have been tied to the Dridex and Zeus banking trojans in the past, as well as to the command and control networks for other sophisticated malware. Media Land-hosted virtual private servers using legitimately assigned IP addresses have been repeatedly reported for malicious traffic, including hundreds of brute-force Remote Desktop Protocol login attacks. Media Land used the fake BGP advertisements for more than just 8kun. According to historical DNS records from SecurityTrails, Media Land had been maintaining an advertisement for a block of addresses starting at 185.254.121.200 for over a month, with the records for 8kun.net addresses popping up about two days ago. The hosts tied to the address block hosted a variety of short-lived malware, phishing, and online pharmacy scam sites, among others, with some dating back to September—all of them hosted by Media Land. Using this sort of fishy routing advertisement is not an uncommon tactic when trying to prevent potential attackers from gathering intelligence on a site's or network's infrastructure. It means that Whois requests and other network tools return no useful information to casual inquiries. That makes targeting the hosting provider somewhat more difficult. Other blocks of unassigned addresses have been used by Media Land repeatedly over the past three years. The Media Land hosting may have been a temporary move by the operators of 8chan/8kun. The site remains live on Tor as a ""hidden service."" And the site's domain name service provider VanwaNet has advertised itself in the past as a Cloudflare alternative—giving customers the capability (at some point in the future) to create their own content-delivery networks to fight DDoS attacks. Ron Watkins, the administrator for 8kun, said in a Twitter post that VanwaTech ""has built a fantastic new deepnet CDN that can deliver Tor hidden services at nearly clearnet speed."" In addition, the 8kun team has apparently been looking at another Tor-like service called Lokinet, an onion-routing based anonymizing network that is still in development. Those services may be crucial for the continued operation of the site, considering that the open Internet version of the site was under attack from almost the instant it went live. ""We have been under sustained attacks the past few days and doing everything we can to get things stable again,"" Ron Watkins reported on Twitter earlier today. ""The site is still online—albeit limping along—as we reorganize and restructure to deflect attacks coming from many angles."" You must login or create an account to comment.

71,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html,"Advertisement Supported by With a Democratic governor in office, the party was in full control of Virginia state government for the first time in a generation. By Trip Gabriel Democrats completed Virginia’s historic partisan shift from red to blue on Tuesday, winning majorities in both chambers of the legislature and consolidating power across state government for the first time in a generation. In an election where passions about President Trump and the impeachment inquiry drove voters on both sides, a revolt against the president in Virginia’s rapidly growing suburbs helped remake the state’s political map. Now, under Gov. Ralph Northam, who survived scandal earlier this year, Democrats are positioned to advance a set of sweeping liberal priorities. Going into Tuesday, Republicans held a 20 to 19 advantage in the State Senate and a 51 to 48 edge in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber. Democrats picked up at least two Senate seats, including an upset in a suburban Richmond district by Ghazala Hashmi, who will be the first Muslim woman in the Senate. A former college literature professor, Ms. Hashmi was brought to the country from India as a child. Running her first campaign, she described experiencing a personal crisis after Mr. Trump ordered a ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries. “I didn’t know if I actually had a home in this country,” she said in an interview before the voting. “My anxiety was caused by wondering if other people would speak up and support the assault we were seeing on civil liberties.” She decided to speak up and represent herself. Other notable winners on Tuesday included Shelly Simonds, a Democrat who lost a House race in 2017 in a random drawing after the votes produced a dead tie. In a rematch, Ms. Simonds defeated the Republican incumbent, David Yancey. Chris Jones, the powerful Republican head of the House appropriations committee, was upset by Clint Jenkins, a small-business owner. And Tim Hugo, the last Republican in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, lost to Dan Helmer in a district that has become more than a quarter Asian and Hispanic — emblematic of the demographic shifts in the state that have remade Virginia, once the seat of the Confederacy. After gaining 15 seats in the House in 2017, Democrats this year picked up at least another five, a signal that the state’s blue groundswell had lost little momentum in the third year of the Trump presidency. The ultimate size of the new Democratic majorities was in flux late Tuesday as a few close races were undecided. “When the House convenes in January, we will welcome new members on both sides of the aisle, and, for the first time in two decades, a new party will sit in the majority,’’ Kirk Cox, the outgoing Republican speaker of the House, who won re-election, said in a statement. In the days ahead of Election Day, Republicans warned direly that conservatives faced an existential crisis, in which they could lose the Virginia they had known, while Democrats argued their opponents had too long tried to block progress on issues like Medicaid expansion, a higher minimum wage and gun safety. Pre-election polling showed the top issues were all ones that favored Democrats: raising the minimum wage to $15, spending more on roads and, especially, after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach this year, expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. After Mr. Northam called a special session in of the legislature in July to respond to gun violence, and the Republican majorities adjourned it after just 90 minutes, Democrats thought they had won a moral victory to use against opponents in the fall. Republicans denounced the session as a political stunt. “The era of Republican obstruction in the Commonwealth of Virginia is now over,’’ former Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. “While tonight we celebrate the history we have made, tomorrow we must begin rewarding voters with action.” Just months ago, Democrats seemed badly wounded heading into an election year as scandal engulfed Mr. Northam and the other top two Democrats in the state. After a racist photo on Mr. Northam’s medical school yearbook page surfaced in February, he initially acknowledged that he was in the photo. He quickly reversed himself. The party was soon thrown further into turmoil, as two women accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, which he denied. But the headlines faded, offering Republicans less ammunition than they once expected. Recent polls show more voters approve of the governor’s performance than disapprove. The balance of power in both chambers turned on just a handful of competitive districts, all in suburban regions outside Washington, Richmond and in Hampton Roads. Swing-district Republicans backpedaled away from Mr. Trump and the party, a brand that had proved toxic in last year’s midterms with the increasingly diverse electorate in suburbia. Some Republicans campaigned more like Democrats, boasting of support for Medicaid expansion that the party long fought in Richmond, for L.G.B.T. rights and even for gun safety measures. With so much at stake — a referendum on the president, the partisan balance of both houses, political momentum going into a presidential election — money cascaded into the normally low-interest legislative races. More than $1 million flowed to 16 individual candidates, who were seeking part-time jobs that pay less than $20,000 a year. Races where television ads had been unheard-of echoed with a cacophony of attacks while Virginians tried to tune out politics for a brief respite during the World Series. Emily’s List, which supports women running for office who back abortion rights, pumped more than $2 million into Democratic races mostly for the House. The former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was the largest outside individual donor. His group Everytown for Gun Safety gave $2.5 million to help Democrats, and Beyond Carbon, his climate change group, donated more than $600,000 to two House candidates in coastal districts. Republicans’ largest donor was the Republican State Leadership Committee ($3.2 million), a national group that supports state-level races, the value of which became clear after sweeping Republican legislative victories in 2010, which led to Republican-drawn voting maps that have influenced power in the states and in Congress. State senators, who serve four-year terms, had not faced voters since 2015, before Mr. Trump’s election. Many Republican senators who were considered most vulnerable occupied districts carried by Mr. Northam in 2017 and by three Democrats who flipped congressional races in 2018. Another factor aiding Democrats was a court-ordered remapping of districts in southeast Virginia. In June, the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision striking down earlier maps as racially gerrymandered. New maps shifted 425,000 voters in 25 districts. They more evenly distributed black voters, which gave Democrats an overall advantage, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. This year, the prospect of the 2021 redistricting after the next census was a quiet but powerful issue for both parties. In recent days, nationally prominent Democrats campaigned alongside statehouse candidates to raise voters’ enthusiasm, including the presidential candidates Joseph R. Biden Jr., Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris. On Saturday, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, sought to inspire volunteer door-knockers by citing what he viewed as Republican outrages in Washington, including Mr. Trump’s abandonment of Kurdish allies in Syria and smears against a decorated Army officer called to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He suggested Democrats could force congressional Republicans to “grow a backbone” by flipping the Virginia House and Senate. Republican surrogates were less visible. Mr. Trump skipped campaigning for fellow Republicans in the state, though Vice President Mike Pence held a rally in Virginia Beach. At a get-out-the-vote gathering on Saturday for the Henrico County Republican Committee, once a Republican stronghold outside Richmond, the headliner was a local talk radio host, John Reid. “I think Democrats have overreached beyond belief,” Mr. Reid told the party faithful, referring to impeachment proceedings. He predicted Republicans would have a good day on Tuesday. “Donald Trump upsets people — that’s fine,” he said. “It cannot be denied that he’s delivered.” Advertisement",2019-11-05 22:04:54,Virginia Democrats Take Control of State Legislature,,1,http://nytimes.com

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A Texas man who was arrested in connection with a shooting at a Halloween party that left two people dead and 12 injured was released from jail on Tuesday and officials requested the charge against him be dismissed. Investigators said ""additional information has come to light"" that undermines the case against 23-year-old Brandon Ray Gonzales, of Greenville. Gonzales was arrested on Oct. 28 at the auto dealership where he worked, less than 48 hours after the shooting at the off-campus college party, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. According to an arrest affidavit, a confidential informant told the Hunt County Sheriff's Office that Gonzales had opened fire at a party hall outside Greenville – about 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN TEXAS SHOOTING SPREE THAT KILLED 2, INJURED 12 Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was released after investigators said ""additional information has come to light"" that undermines the evidence against him.
      (Hunt County Jail) In a statement issued Tuesday evening, Meeks said that the initial probable cause arrest warrant contained credible information and statements given to investigators, but additional information and the lack of cooperation from witnesses undermined the case against Gonzales. The shooting took place around midnight at what Meeks described as a joint Halloween and homecoming party for Texas A&M University-Commerce students. The shooter is believed to have entered the venue through the back door and opened with a handgun, Meeks said. He described ""complete chaos"" at the small venue after shots rang out, with hundreds of people -- including the gunman -- fleeing. BEFORE MASS SHOOTING, TEXAS GUNMAN ‘WAS ON A LONG SPIRAL DOWN,’ INVESTIGATOR SAYS Authorities also believe the shooter may have been targeting just one person out of roughly 750 people and other victims were shot at random, Meeks added. Kevin Berry Jr., 23, of Dallas, and Byron Craven Jr., 23, of Arlington, were killed, authorities said. Of the 12 people injured, six were shot and six were trampled or hurt by glass, authorities added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meeks said that Gonzales admitted to attending the party, but denied carrying out the shooting, KXAS-TV reported. After Gonzales' arrest, his brother Gabriel defended him, saying authorities arrested the wrong person, the station reported. ""He's not that person they're making him out to be. That's not him.

X OUR PICKS: RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia Democrats continued their winning streak under President Trump on Tuesday and took full control of the statehouse for the first time in more than two decades. Suburban voters turned out in big numbers to back Democratic candidates, continuing a trend of once GOP-friendly suburbs turning blue. This is the third election in a row in which Democrats made significant gains since Trump was elected. “I’m here to officially declare today, November 5, 2019, that Virginia is officially blue,” Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam told a crowd of supporters in Richmond. Of the four states with legislative elections this year, Virginia is the only one where control of the statehouse was up for grabs. Republicans had slim majorities in both the state House and Senate. National groups, particularly those aligned with Democrats, pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive expensive messaging and get-out-the-vote campaigns ahead of the 2020 cycle. Gun control and clean-energy groups affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent several million dollars helping Democrats. Virginia also drew several high-profile visits from 2020 presidential hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as current Vice President Mike Pence. President Donald Trump tried to rally Republicans via Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, a state he lost in 2016. The only candidate Trump endorsed by name, Republican Geary Higgins, was handily defeated in a contest for a northern Virginia Senate district that was previously held by the GOP. The president’s election three years ago has been disastrous for Virginia Republicans, particularly in growing suburban areas. Democrats have won every statewide contest, picked up three additional congressional seats and now are set to control both the state house and the Executive Mansion for the first time since 1994. Republicans hoped in vain that an off-year election with no statewide candidates on the ballot would help defuse the anti-Trump energy that powered previous cycles. GOP lawmakers also bet on the specter of a possible Trump impeachment providing a last-minute surge by motivating the Republican base. Democrats have pledged that when they take power, they will pass an agenda that Republicans have blocked for years, including stricter gun laws, a higher minimum wage and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. Democrats were keenly focused on gun issues during the election, saying Republicans should be held accountable for failing to pass new restrictions after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach earlier this year. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to use the tragedy for political gain while focusing heavily on past Democratic efforts to loosen restrictions for third-trimester abortion. The GOP also warned of higher taxes and energy prices if they lose the majority. House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert on Tuesday predicted that Democrats would pursue an “extreme agenda” that would undo Republican efforts to make Virginia a business-friendly state. “Virginians should expect public policies that look a lot more like the train-wreck that is California than the Virginia of good fiscal management and common-sense conservative governance,” Gilbert said in a statement. Tuesday’s election could help cement Democratic rule for the next decade, because the winners will decide who controls the next redistricting process. Lawmakers approved a proposed constitutional amendment this year that would create a new bipartisan commission empowered to draw legislative and congressional maps, but Democrats would have to sign off on it again next year before it could be presented to voters.

74,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/democrats-just-swept-into-full-control-of-virginias-government/,"AP Photo/Steve Helber For the first time in more than two decades, Democrats now have full control of Virginia’s state government. According to projections, Democratic candidates have won enough seats in the state Senate and the House of Delegates for majority control of the state’s legislature. Virginia’s off-off-year state elections drew an unprecedented amount of national attention—and money—as Democratic fundraisers and national progressive groups seized upon the opportunity to flip the Virginia legislature. After the gains Democrats made in the state in 2017, Republicans held only a slim majority in both the state Senate and House. And, thanks to redrawn district maps that favored Democrats in several key districts, that majority was under serious threat, even after a trio of scandals involving the state’s Democratic governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. Democrats needed only one seat to flip the state’s Senate, which they clinched with John Bell defeating Geary Higgins in District 13, a seat vacated by the retiring Sen. Richard H. Black. In the state’s House of Delegates, Democrats won the three they needed to gain control, with wins in District 76, where Clinton Jenkins defeated the incumbent Chris Jones, as well as in District 94, where Shelly Simonds—who lost in 2017 in race that was decided by a coin flip—defeated incumbent David Yancey. The debate over strengthening the state’s gun control laws was at the center of Virginia’s elections. In the wake of the mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, in which a disgruntled city employee entered a municipal building and killed 12 people, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam convened a special legislative session for the sole purpose of passing new gun control measures. But the GOP majority, led by House Speaker Kirk Cox, voted to end the session after just 90 minutes—without passing any bills. In the weeks leading up to the election, polls showed that gun control was the leading issue for voters, and Democrats seized on it as a central aspect of their messaging. The national gun reform group Every Town For Gun Safety and its sister organization, Moms Demand Action, spent $2.5 million to support Democratic candidates in the state. With the Democrats now in full control of Virginia government, they are finally in a position to push forward several pieces of progressive legislation that’s been held up for years by Republicans. In addition to tougher gun regulations, Democrats hope to enact workplace and housing protections for LGBTQ residents, and a higher minimum wage.

75,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/F3G5nltZQjQ/,"The chair of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, looked out at a jubilant crowd on the evening of Nov. 5. “Two years ago,” he said, “you here in Virginia taught America that we Democrats could win again. Tonight, you’re going to finish the business.” Perez’s prediction proved accurate. Democrats seized control of both houses of Virginia’s state legislature for the first time in 25 years, aided by unusually high turnout across the state. It was an intensification of the trend that began in 2017, when Virginia’s off-year election provided some of the first signs of the backlash against President Donald Trump that would help Democrats seize control of the House of Representatives in 2018. In a college-campus brew pub here, a diverse crowd of Democrats cheered, hugged and cried as the results rolled in, exceeding their most optimistic expectations. Tuesday’s results in elections across the country are likely to reverberate nationally. Democrats hope that, like last time, they are a sign of things to come in 2020. The party’s candidate, Andy Beshear, also appeared to have won the governorship of Kentucky, declaring victory over an unpopular GOP incumbent by a slim margin in a state Trump won by 30 points in 2016. Trump rallied in Kentucky on the eve of the election in an attempt to save the incumbent, Matt Bevin, a prickly former businessman who’d tried to curtail the state’s Medicaid program and feuded with teachers over pensions. “If you lose,” the president said on Nov. 4, “they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can’t let that happen to me!” Bevin, who declined to concede defeat after the vote, had argued that the impeachment of Trump under way in the House would anger GOP partisans and drive them out to vote. Instead, Bevin’s loss indicates that Trump may be an anchor rather than a buoy for his party. It is likely to factor into the thinking of nervous Senate Republicans as they contemplate whether to continue standing behind Trump despite the increasing evidence he explicitly demanded political favors from the Ukrainian government in exchange for U.S. security aid. This week’s election results suggest that Trump’s appeals do indeed galvanize the GOP base, but he inspires the Democrats even more—a nightmare trap for Republican officeholders who may have to choose between antagonizing the opposition and antagonizing their own side, losing either way. To be sure, the off-year election was not a wipeout for the GOP. Republicans won every statewide race in Kentucky beside the governor’s, an indication that Bevin’s personal unpopularity was the decisive factor. (Among his many cloddish statements, Bevin once contended that a teachers strike would lead to child molestation; before becoming governor, he had split the Kentucky GOP by running against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell from the right.) The GOP easily held onto the governorship in Mississippi, another deep-red state where Trump held an election-eve rally. The demographic trends Trump accelerated in 2016 continued, with suburban, college-educated and female voters moving toward Democrats while rural areas grew ever stronger for Republicans. But in Virginia, a historically red state that has voted Democratic in the last three presidential elections, Democrats romped to victory up and down the ballot. The victories came despite a pair of scandals involving Governor Ralph Northam (blackface) and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax (alleged sexual assault), and they carry policy consequences in addition to their symbolic weight. In Manassas’s exurban county, the county board previously chaired by a Trump-loving, anti-immigration neo-Confederate is now majority Democratic for the first time in decades, with a new progressive district attorney and sheriff. Democrats also captured the board in neighboring Loudoun County, where one of the winning candidates was a woman who lost her government-contracting job after being photographed flipping off Trump’s motorcade from her bicycle in 2017. In the statehouse, party leaders plan to use their new majorities to enact gun control and LGBT anti-discrimination laws, raise the minimum wage and pass the Equal Rights Amendment. The gun issue proved particularly potent and serves as a snapshot of the Old Dominion’s political turnabout. Republicans, buoyed by the Virginia-based National Rifle Association, once wielded the Second Amendment as a political cudgel. But national public opinion on guns has evolved as a cash-rich, activist-driven gun-control movement has risen in recent years. After a mass shooting in Virginia Beach claimed 12 lives in May, the governor convened a special legislative session to consider reforms—only to have GOP leaders adjourn the state House and Senate after 90 minutes without considering any bills. The national gun-control movement poured money into the legislative races, and in polls and news reports, many Virginia voters cited the gun issue as a motivator. Now, in many areas, it is Democrats who see the gun issue as a political asset, a stunning reversal from just a few years ago. Republicans sought to downplay the election outcome as the result of local factors. In a week’s time, they’ll have a chance to recapture another red-state governorship in Louisiana. But to Perez, the Democratic chairman, this election is a cheering portent. “This is a microcosm of America,” he tells TIME. “In Trump Country, they now see the president for what he is. And they’re coming back to the Democratic side.” Write to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com.",2019-11-06 03:54:23,Democrats Seize Control of Historically Red Virginia’s State Legislature,,4419,http://time.com

79,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/mike-bloombergs-gun-control-outspends-nra-helps-democrats-win-virginia.html," A gun-control lobbying group funded largely by billionaire Michael Bloomberg just helped Democrats take over the state government in Virginia – right in the National Rifle Association's backyard. In Tuesday's elections, the Democrats tipped the Virginia House and Senate in their favor, giving them full control of the state government for the first time since 1994. The election had stronger-than-usual turnout in the suburbs, according to media reports. While the results could be a good omen for Democrats' chances in 2020, it may also be a tipping point in the money battle over gun rights. Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun-control advocacy group that the former New York mayor helps fund, spent $2.5 million this year to influence voters in Virginia versus approximately $300,000 by the NRA, which has its headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia. ""In the past, the NRA has had its way with lawmakers because it was considered powerful and wealthy, and that has dynamic changed drastically — even within the last year,"" said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which is part of Everytown. The NRA, in a statement, said ""Virginians are about to experience life under a distant tycoon's thumb,"" referring to Bloomberg. ""Candidates who proudly accepted Bloomberg's cash — and every voter they misled — will soon realize the cost of being beholden to a Manhattan billionaire who despises Virginians' right to self-defense,"" the organization said. Other issues, such as minimum wage and health care, were also a focus for voters in the election. But gun control was in the spotlight. Three in 4 voters rated gun policy, including mandatory background checks, a ""very important"" issue, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. A mass shooting in Virginia Beach left a dozen dead earlier this year, while massacres in Ohio, Texas and California also emboldened groups calling for tougher gun laws. Bloomberg helped found Everytown for Gun Safety in 2014 to ""end gun violence and counter the Washington gun lobby."" The group put its focus beyond Congress, to bring attention to state elections and corporate boards, ""fields of play formerly occupied almost solely by the gun lobby."" Bloomberg has pledged to spend at least $50 million to support the cause. The group now has 350,000 financial backers, though Bloomberg remains a major contributor. The group's influence has seeped into corporate boardrooms, too. The Virginia election came after a number of executives came out in favor of gun reform, amid Everytown's advocacy and a steady stream of mass shootings. Walmart in September said it will discontinue all sales of handgun ammunition and sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition that can be used with military-style weapons, following two ""horrific"" shootings at Walmart stores this summer. The same month, chief executives of 145 companies signed a letter urging the U.S. Senate to pass a bill mandating background checks. The list included leaders of companies like Levi Strauss, Gap and Beyond Meat. H.R. 8, a bipartisan proposal, passed the Democratic-controlled House in February passed the Democratic-controlled House in February. The bill has yet to come to a vote in the GOP-controlled Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not put any bill up for a vote unless he is sure that President Donald Trump would sign it. The list of 145 executives did not include some of the country's largest or most powerful institutions such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Apple. It also did not included some of the largest companies headquartered in Virginia, such as Dollar Tree, General Dynamics, Capital One Financial and Northrop Grumman. Bloomberg tweeted Tuesday night to celebrate the election results, calling out the influence of another group he helps fund, Beyond Carbon, a $500 million group that advocates for energy reform. Tweet The NRA's spending on the Virginia election is much less than the $1 million it reportedly spent on Virginia TV ads in 2017, when Everytown-backed Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor's race. That year, the NRA's blitz included a $750,000 spending spree between mid-October and Election Day. But political leaders are increasingly zeroing in on the group, and its financial health is now in question. The NRA has lodged a lawsuit targeting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his state's regulators, saying their efforts to dissuade insurance and financial companies from doing business with the organization will cause ""irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"" to the organization. The NRA is under investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James following allegations of misconduct. Those include media reports of millions of dollars of improper payments, which puts into question its status as a tax-exempt nonprofit. The revocation of that status could have a large impact on its finances, experts have said. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has alleged that the NRA acted as a ""foreign agent"" for Russia during the 2016 election. In a report issued earlier this year, he alleged that convicted Russian operative Maria Butina and Alexander Torshin ""utilized a network of Russian oligarchs and high-ranking Kremlin officials to bring the NRA to Moscow with promises of lucrative business opportunities with Russian entities."" The NRA spent $30 million to help elect Trump in 2016, more than double the $12.5 million spent on behalf of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.org. The NRA also spent $1.6 million during the first half of the year lobbying Congress against laws that would enact stricter background checks for people looking to buy guns.

81,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/06/halloween-party-shooting-killed-five-response-airbnb-policy,"A community is frustrated by the lack of empathy for the five victims shot at an event in an affluent San Francisco Bay area city Last modified on Thu 17 Dec 2020 14.32 GMT Five days after a mass shooting at an Airbnb in a small, wealthy community left five people dead, residents across California’s Bay Area are frustrated by the police response and the focus on Airbnb policies rather than the victims.  The five partygoers killed in the shooting at a Halloween party in the city of Orinda on Thursday evening were in their late teens and 20s, and had come to Orinda from other less-affluent Bay Area towns, including Oakland, Richmond, Vallejo, Pittsburg and Antioch. An Instagram advertisement for the “Airbnb Mansion Party” circulating on social media, made it clear that the party’s organizers, and many of the attendees, were black. “If her name was Alison instead of Tiyon, if his name was Michael instead of Omar, if these children were white or it was one of your kids, would you still be OK with this coverage?” said Cheryl Sudduth, a Bay Area resident and commissioner of the county’s Racial Justice Oversight Body. “I guarantee the answer is not yes.” “People see a white child as a victim, but a black child is seen as part of the circumstances. People say, ‘What do you think happens when you have a party with more than a few of you?’” she said. On Monday, law enforcement still had not made any arrests, or even told the public whether there were one or multiple suspects in the quintuple murder, which claimed the lives of a beloved young local DJ 24-year-old Omar Taylor, 19-year-old Oshiana Thompkins, 22-year-old Tiyon Farley, 29-year-old Javlin County, and 23-year-old Raymon Hill Jr. The Orinda police chief’s first message at a news conference on Friday was reassurance to local residents: “We haven’t been able to confirm how many suspects there are,” chief David Cook said, but, “we have no reason to believe they were from Orinda.” Local officials have yet to provide any public details about the possible shooter or shooters, what type of firearm was used, or even how many people in total were injured because some of the injured may have driven or been taken to the hospital by car rather than ambulance. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Tuesday that law enforcement officials were investigating whether the shooting was connected to another shooting in San Francisco in 2015 that left four young people dead. At a Orinda city council meeting on Tuesday evening, much of the conversation focused on the policies for short-term rentals. Darrion Jones, a 25-year-old native of Richmond told the Guardian he believed one of the only reasons the Orinda Halloween shooting made the national news in the first place was because it happened in a small, wealthy town with little history of gun violence. But the reaction that followed the media coverage was not the typical reaction to a mass shooting, he said. “What bothers is me that innocent lives were lost and on Twitter you usually see all these ‘pray for’ hashtags. But this wasn’t that,” Jones said. “No matter what the situation was [the shooter] killed innocent people and it doesn’t have the same impact because it’s black kids. That’s the bottom line,” said Jones, who says his first experience with losing someone to gun violence was during his freshman year of high school. “[If] it’s an inner-city area, that kind of stuff gets looked over because people think it’s common,” Jones said. “But it deserves the same attention as people whose lives are lost in other areas.” Christine Chalmers, an Orinda resident who lives just four houses away from the Airbnb where the shooting took place, said that some of her neighbors’ reactions to the violence left her disappointed. “Part of what we love about Orinda is how close we are to so many parts of the Bay Area. So then to retreat into ‘We don’t have that here’ feels like a betrayal of our larger Bay Area community,” Chalmers said. Chalmers recalls looking out of her window around 2.30am, about five hours after the shooting, as police gathered witness statements. She says she saw party-goers trying to stay warm and heard the sounds of people sobbing. “I can’t describe how horrible that is,” Chalmers said. Afterwards, Chalmers said, the “un-generous” comments she’s heard about the shooting from some of her neighbors left her saddened, but not surprised. “I don’t know any community that’s immune from racism and white supremacy,” she said. But the Orinda resident challenged the notion that the majority of her neighbors were more concerned about disruption from chaotic Airbnb parties than the lives that had been lost. There is a large faction of Orinda residents who are collecting donations, beautifying memorials, and sharing links to GoFundMe pages for the five victims, Chalmers said. “I think the majority of people in Orinda that I’ve interacted with feel that these are our losses. I think it’s a very small group who feel otherwise.” In a 2018 study of gun violence coverage in the San Francisco Bay area, researchers with the Berkeley Media Studies group found that the overrepresentation of young black and Latino males as victims and perpetrators of gun violence can reinforce harmful racial stereotypes, including the belief that gun violence is an inevitable part of life for communities of color, rather than a preventable issue. “They’ll tell you as if you’re talking about the weather,” Sudduth says of some news coverage about gun violence victims of color who are from lower-income communities. “There was another shooting in East Palo Alto, four more people died. Tomorrow, the sun will set at 6pm. Like it’s no big deal,” Sudduth continues. The Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit that produces national data on shootings using public media reports, describes a mass shooting as any instance during which four or more people are shot. By their definition, there have been more than 330 mass shootings in the United States this year, more than one a day. But the victim count alone does not determine which mass shootings are treated as national tragedies, with major news coverage and response from lawmakers. Activists say there have long been stark racial and class disparities in which shootings are seen as high-profile incidents – and which victims are seen as “innocent”. Race is certainly one of the factors that can lead to inconsistencies in the way mass shootings are reported on and the amount of attention they garner, said Jim MacMillan, a fellow at the Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri School of Journalism who examines the way gun violence is covered by news media. “There is a discrepancy in coverage,” MacMillan says. “If you think all of the mass shootings that have gotten collective national coverage and you can pick up a national newspaper and see all the faces the next day. They’re not usually black faces.”",2019-11-06 10:57:17,"After a Halloween party shooting, focus on Airbnb policy draws outrage",,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

(AP) — Virginia Democrats promised swift action on a host of liberal policy proposals now that they've won full control of state government for the first time in more than two decades. Democratic leaders said Virginians should expect a higher minimum wage, new gun restrictions and greater abortion rights after their party flipped control of the state House and Senate in Tuesday's election. They also promised ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. With Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam already in office, Democrats will now have full control of the statehouse for the first time in 26 years. ""Tomorrow the work begins and the people want to see results,"" Sen. Dick Saslaw, poised to be the next Senate majority leader when lawmakers return to the Capitol in January, told supporters at a victory party in Richmond. ""And let me tell you, for God's sake, they're going to get results."" Tuesday's victory extended the Democrats' winning streak under President Donald Trump. Suburban voters turned out in big numbers to back Democratic candidates, continuing a trend of once GOP-friendly suburbs turning blue. This is the third election in a row in which Virginia Democrats made significant gains since President Donald Trump was elected. The Democrats' big win was a warning sign for the president and Republicans ahead of next year's election. Higher-educated and more affluent suburban voters — particularly women — have revolted against Trump's GOP both in Virginia and nationwide. The suburbs leaned Republican in the past but have become a key battleground amid shifting demographics and Trump's turbulent presidency. Tuesday was a rough night for many suburban Republicans in Virginia. Del. Tim Hugo lost his spot as the last Republican representing Fairfax County, northern Virginia's most populous suburban jurisdiction. Of the four states with legislative elections this year, Virginia was the only one where control of the statehouse was up for grabs. Republicans lost their slim majorities in both the state House and Senate. National groups, particularly those aligned with Democrats, pumped huge amounts of money into the contests to test-drive expensive messaging and get-out-the-vote campaigns ahead of the 2020 balloting. Gun control and clean-energy groups affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent several million dollars helping Democrats. Virginia also drew several high-profile visits from 2020 presidential hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as current Vice President Mike Pence. President Donald Trump tried to rally Republicans via Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, a state he lost in 2016. The only candidate Trump endorsed by name, Republican Geary Higgins, was handily defeated in a northern Virginia Senate district previously held by the GOP. Gary Keener and wife Marthanne Huffines-Keener, of Glen Allen, a suburb just north of Richmond, said they voted Republican for years but have voted Democrat since the 2008 election of former President Barack Obama. They said Trump definitely had a large impact on Virginia's election. ""We didn't want to make that our only reason for coming out,"" Keener said. ""But he's a baboon. We do some traveling, and wherever we go, we're embarrassed."" Republicans hoped an off-year election with no statewide candidates on the ballot would help defuse the anti-Trump energy that powered previous cycles. GOP lawmakers also bet on the specter of a possible Trump impeachment providing a last-minute surge by motivating the Republican base. Republicans were able to hold on to several seats in close races but expressed disappointment with the overall outcome of the night. House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert on Tuesday predicted that Democrats would pursue an ""extreme agenda"" that would undo Republican efforts to make Virginia a business-friendly state. ""Virginians should expect public policies that look a lot more like the train-wreck that is California than the Virginia of good fiscal management and common-sense conservative governance,"" Gilbert said in a statement. Democrats were keenly focused on gun issues during the election, saying Republicans should be held accountable for failing to pass new restrictions after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach earlier this year. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to use the tragedy for political gain while focusing heavily on past Democratic efforts to loosen restrictions for third-trimester abortion. The Democratic victories Tuesday will make the legislature more diverse. Sen.-elect Ghazala Hashmi is the first Muslim-American woman to serve in the Senate.  Del. Danica Roem, who made history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a U.S. state legislature, easily won reelection. Jenne Nurse, a 25-year-old who recently accepted a state government job, said she's excited about the increasing diversity. ""It's nice to see the Virginia Legislature look like Virginia. It's so important,"" said Nurse, who is black. Tuesday's election could help cement Democratic rule for the next decade, because the winners will decide who controls the next redistricting process. Lawmakers approved a proposed constitutional amendment this year that would create a new bipartisan commission empowered to draw legislative and congressional maps. Democrats have to sign off on it again next year before presenting it to voters. ___ Associated Press reporters Sarah Rankin and Denise Lavoie contributed to this report. All of our content is free.

85,https://spectator.org/ending-school-violence/,"   The pool of Democratic presidential candidates shrank after Robert O’Rourke, who was hovering around 1 percent in the polls and nearly out of campaign funds, ended his quixotic bid. O’Rourke was the most vocal proponent of gun confiscation of all the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, most of whom call for some abrogation of Second Amendment rights. The topic of stricter gun laws has taken on greater urgency, O’Rourke and others claim, due to an alleged uptick in mass shootings. Advocates of stronger gun restrictions often point to school shootings and argue their motivation is to safeguard children. As horrifying as they are, mass school shootings are not even close to the biggest killer of our sons and daughters. A pair of Northwestern University researchers report that on average about 10 people, including students, faculty and staff, have been killed annually in mass shootings since 1996. Of course, this is 10 deaths too many. Compared with other school-related fatalities, mass school shootings are not the biggest threat to our nation’s youth. Each year, an average of 800,000 injuries, about one-fifth of all injuries suffered by school-aged children, occur at school. The other, deadlier causes that affect school-aged children do not get nearly the same amount of attention from social activists and media outlets, as do mass shootings. Self-inflicted death is among the biggest threats. At more than 6,200 deaths annually, suicide is the second leading cause of death for high school teens and young adults ages 15 to 24. And it’s on the rise. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports 1,241 people were killed in school transportation–related crashes between 2008 and 2017. This included school buses, private vehicles, bicycles, and walking. The death toll of around 124 people annually is more than 10 times larger than school mass shooting incidents. Yet no one is calling for a ban on yellow school buses. According to analysis of three decades of FBI data, an average of 498 children of all ages are killed by their parents each year. Of these, 52 children between 7 and 17 years old are killed annually. This figure is demonstrably higher than school mass shootings, but no current presidential candidate is known to be campaigning on eliminating filicide. In addition to demanding new gun ownership restrictions, some politicians have called for the regulation of video games as a gun-violence instigator. But are violent video games really to blame? Still, reducing gun violence in schools is an admirable goal. But activists are ignoring critical details that may identify the root causes of gun violence. Let’s examine the shooter rather than the inanimate objects. There is a profile of a typical school shooter that has emerged in the past quarter-century. The shooter is a male, from a broken home, and was taking or had taken a Schedule II medication, a heavy-duty category of narcotics that includes methamphetamine and cocaine, to treat ADHD or depression. Another inescapable point common to school shooters is they attend public schools rather than private or parochial schools or are homeschooled. Perhaps the absence of a value system in many public schools is a contributor. Another irrefutable point is society’s daughters also live under the same troubling circumstances of broken homes, have access to guns, and play violent video games, but schoolgirls are not mass shooters. What is the difference? An obvious factor is the absence of a father or father-figure and his role in raising a well-behaved son. Unfortunately, the importance of a responsible male in the life of an adolescent boy runs counter to the narrative argued by some political constituencies that the presence of a father is unimportant. This attitude is not a recent phenomenon. Three decades ago, Vice President Dan Quayle was vilified by the political Left and the media when he criticized the “Murphy Brown” television program for “mocking the importance of fathers.” O’Rourke’s departure from the presidential race is not expected to end the call to confiscate guns in the name of the children. It does, however, turn down the volume of the loudest advocate.

86,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/06/virginia-election-democrats-seize-control/,"Trending: RICHMOND, Va. — Gov. Ralph Northam laid out his vision Wednesday for a changing Virginia a day after Democrats seized control of the General Assembly for the first time in more than two decades. Northam, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, promised swift action on a host of liberal policy proposals, with a particular emphasis on gun control measures. He said Democratic gains were largely powered by voters who wanted to see commonsense gun laws enacted and noted that Republicans adjourned a special session earlier this year called in response to a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in less than 90 minutes “with no results.” “The landscape has changed,” Northam said. Democratic leaders say Virginians should also expect a higher minimum wage and greater abortion rights after their gains Tuesday.

87,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/608850700/0/phoenix/opinions~Will-Airbnb-ban-on-party-houses-work-Scottsdale-Paradise-Valley-would-like-to-know/,"Airbnb’s announced ban on “party houses” following a deadly mass shooting in Northern California last week represents a promising, if predictable, response. How would the company carry out the pledge? I’m not the only one asking this question. Anthony Wanger, an entrepreneur and investor who lives in Paradise Valley, was among the first to respond to Airbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chetsky on Twitter. “Hi Brian. Let’s connect (fellow entrepreneur here). We had a terrifying party house on my block. Police even posted a criminal notice. Yet @Airbnb ignored every abuse report, letter and subpoena we sent. Glad to share docs, names and dates, etc. Thank you.” Hi Brian. Let’s connect (fellow entrepreneur here). We had a terrifying party house on my block. Police even posted a criminal notice. Yet @Airbnb ignored every abuse report, letter and subpoena we sent. Glad to share docs, names and dates, etc. Thank you. pic.twitter.com/cTc8i63mnm Indeed, among communities following with interest Airbnb’s crackdown promise, I imagine, are Scottsdale and Paradise Valley, where residents have had beefs with how short-term vacation rentals have turned their neighborhoods on occasion into party central and brought with it all the accompanying headaches — loud noise, clogged parking, disruptive behavior. Looking for the other side of the story? Subscribe today for access to even more opinions. Cities and towns have been trying to deal with the bad actors who rent properties via home-sharing services such as Airbnb, VRBO and FlipKey and create havoc for neighbors. Mostly their powers have been limited to noise or parking violations. Arizona's efforts have been in fits and starts given lawmakers' preference, until recently, for a laissez-faire approach to regulation. Wanger has been more vocal than most flustered neighbors of short-term vacation rentals. He filed a number of noise and nuisance complaints with Paradise Valley police on a neighboring house that’s listed on Airbnb — in one instance, of a guest who, appearing to be intoxicated, stumbled onto his property and rang his doorbell at 1:30 in the morning and, in another, of loud partying in the backyard replete with a DJ and a pig roast. The calls eventually resulted in Paradise Valley issuing a “site of unruly gathering” notice on the property — the subject of Wanger’s tweet to the Airbnb CEO. His tweet, as was the case with his other efforts to engage Airbnb, has gotten no response. The shooting in the San Francisco suburb of Orinda epitomized the worst fears about home-sharing services and how they are exploited. The property owners of a four-bedroom house rented to a woman who reportedly sought the short-term rental listed on Airbnb for her dozen family members with asthma and in need of refuge from a wildfire in nearby Sonoma County. The home somehow became the destination of a Halloween shindig that was advertised on social media as an “Airbnb mansion party.” More than 100 partygoers were at the house when gunfire erupted, leaving five people mortally wounded. Neighbors made noise complaints, starting about an hour and a half before the shooting. In some ways, the Orinda case has strong resonance in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale. Both cities boast a fair share of luxury homes available on home-sharing apps and websites — Airbnb has a “luxe homes” section in which properties are listed for several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars a night. They attract big parties of folks who gather for everything from bachelor’s parties to annual events like spring training, car shows and golf tournaments. All of which raises the possibility, and level, of rowdy behavior. Arizona lawmakers this year passed legislation that aims in part to curb the very party-house events Airbnb is now promising to ban. The legislation prohibits use of a short-term rental property for special events that otherwise would require a permit or license, or as a retail space, restaurant or banquet hall. It also requires the property owners to provide authorities a contact in case of a complaint and obtain a tax license before operating. Critics say it doesn’t go far enough and want to impose additional restrictions, such as capping the number of overnight guests based on number of bedrooms. And going beyond the maximum penalty of $1,500 for repeat violations. Some also favor giving municipalities greater flexibility to set their own rules. Yet if the Orinda incident is an indicator, no amount of safeguards can guarantee peace or safety. According to reports, the homeowners had been cited in the last year for violating local parking ordinances and exceeding the legal capacity of the home. They were also the targets of other complaints including overflowing trash and loud partying. Yet the town did not find cause to intervene more. Nor did Airbnb, despite its claims of deploying “predictive analytics and machine learning to instantly evaluate hundreds of signals that help us flag and investigate suspicious activity before it happens."" Its software and algorithms apparently did not include web searches for red flags like ""Airbnb mansion party."" It’s why Wanger — and others — may have good reason to be skeptical of the party-house ban. Reach Abe Kwok at akwok@azcentral.com. On Twitter: @abekwok.

Matt Bevin would not concede the race on Tuesday night as Democrat Andy Beshear held a lead of more than 5,000 votes. | Timothy D. Easley/AP Photo WHERE WE ARE ... DEMOCRATS captured control of the Virginia House of Delegates and state Senate, the first time they’ve controlled the entire government “in a generation,” per the WaPo. -- NYT’S JONATHAN MARTIN: “For the first time since 1993, Democrats control both chambers in the legislature and the governor’s office -- allowing them to redraw the state’s legislative boundaries after next year’s census. “Linking Republican incumbents to the unpopular president and criticizing them for opposing gun control measures in the aftermath of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Democratic challengers built their victory with strong showings in suburbs stretching from outside Washington to Richmond and Hampton Roads. In Fairfax County, the state’s largest jurisdiction, the last remaining Republican lawmaker was defeated.” NYT DEMOCRATS APPEAR TO HAVE TOPPLED the unpopular sitting Republican governor of Kentucky one day after a visit from President DONALD TRUMP. Democrat ANDY BESHEAR leads Republican Gov. MATT BEVIN by more than 5,000 votes, according to Steve Shepard, who is in Lexington for us. POLITICO REPUBLICANS, THOUGH, had success throughout the rest of the state. Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL’S former legal counsel, Daniel Cameron, was elected attorney general -- the first black person to be elected to that office. Lexington Herald-Leader PENNSYLVANIA -- a state key to TRUMP’S re-election prospects -- is turning toward Democrats in a historic fashion. -- PHILLY INQUIRER: “The blue wave crashed down on Pennsylvania again, as voters from Philly to Delaware County turned left,” by Julia Terruso: “The political forces that shaped last year’s midterm elections showed no signs of abating Tuesday, as voters turned on Republicans and establishment Democrats alike in races from Philadelphia and Scranton to the suburbs of Delaware and Chester Counties. … “Locally, Democrats will hold all five seats on the Delaware County Council, a Republican stronghold since the Civil War, and also assumed a majority on the legislative body in Chester County. In Bucks County, Democrats also held a late lead for control of the board of commissioners in a close race.” Inquirer HOW DOES THIS ALL affect TRUMP’S political fortunes? Do Republicans take a look at Tuesday night’s electoral results and rethink whether they want to stick with the president on impeachment? (For the most part, we doubt Rs will ditch Trump.) Will it affect Trump’s 2020 campaign strategy or his governing posture? Will the president look, in any way, to try to partner with Democrats on something popular, or will he continue his current posture, which is he’s being impeached for doing nothing wrong, and there’s nothing really the two parties can work on? THERE ARE TWO WAYS FOR REPUBLICANS TO LOOK AT TUESDAY NIGHT. One way: We won the Mississippi governor race, we won almost the entire slate of races in Kentucky and Bevin lost because he was unpopular. All of that’s true -- but just part of the story. The other way to look at it is: Pennsylvania is slipping away, Virginia is gone and Kentucky -- a state TRUMP won by nearly 30 points in 2016 -- has elected a Democrat in a race where impeachment was center stage. HERE’S HOW TRUMP CAST the Kentucky race in his rally for Bevin earlier this week: “If you win, they are going to make it like, ho hum. And if you lose, they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can’t let that happen to me!” -- AND HERE’S WHAT HE SAID TUESDAY NIGHT: @realDonaldTrump at 11:37 p.m.: “#ElectionNight Won 5 out of 6 elections in Kentucky, including 5 great candidates that I spoke for and introduced last night. @MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!). Winning in Mississippi Governor race!” … at 11:51 p.m.: “Congratulations to @tatereeves on winning Governor of the Great State of Mississippi. Our big Rally on Friday night moved the numbers from a tie to a big WIN. Great reaction under pressure Tate!” FWIW: TRUMP won Mississippi by 17 points in 2016. THE STEP BACK … WAPO’S BOB COSTA: “[T]he Kentucky defeat has sparked concern among the party’s donors and many longtime GOP leaders who are worried that the nonstop twists of the House impeachment inquiry and Trump’s growing fury are making it increasingly difficult for Republicans to make a clear and compelling case to voters.” WaPo -- AP’S STEVE PEOPLES in New York: “It’s difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from state elections, each with their own unique quirks and personalities. But there’s little doubt Tuesday’s outcome is a warning to Republicans across the nation a year out from the 2020 election and a year after the 2018 midterms: The suburbs are still moving in the wrong direction.” AP AND YET … NEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL: “Poll: Majority expects Trump to win in 2020,” by Caitlin Oprysko: “With less than a year to go before the 2020 election, a majority of registered voters say they think it’s at least somewhat likely that President Donald Trump will secure a second term in the White House, a new poll has found, with almost a third of voters saying the president will be top of mind when casting their vote next November. “According to a POLITICO/Morning Consult survey released on Wednesday, 56 percent of voters expect the president to be reelected next year, including 85 percent of Republicans and 51 percent of independents. By comparison, more than a third of Democrats (35 percent) say the same.” POLITICO Good Wednesday morning. A message from Facebook: The internet has changed a lot since 1996 - internet regulations should too It's been 25 years since comprehensive internet regulations passed. See why we support updated regulations on key issues, including: – Protecting people’s privacy– Enabling safe and easy data portability between platforms– Preventing election interference– Reforming Section 230 IMPEACHMENT … IN THE EARLY DAYS OF POLITICO, our co-founders John Harris and Jim VandeHei often asked us to try to report as if we were putting our sources on truth serum. What would they say if they couldn’t lie? SO AFTER TUESDAY’S BOMBSHELL transcript release -- GORDON SONDLAND and KURT VOLKER -- we buzzed our top House Republican sources and challenged them to tell us what they were actually thinking about TRUMP’S standing at the moment. -- THEY UNDERSTAND TRUMP IS IN DEEP TROUBLE. “Without a doubt,” one House Republican told us, this is the biggest political pickle TRUMP has been in. That’s why Republicans are taking the highly unusual step of putting Rep. JIM JORDAN (R-Ohio) on the Intelligence Committee to defend the president: He needs reinforcements, and fast. (We hear it will just be Jordan that gets a slot on that panel.) -- THEIR STRATEGY IS TO OBFUSCATE. Republicans understand that they “have a tough set of facts,” as one told us, and they are going to try to muddy the waters and distract from the obviously troubling testimony delivered by every witness Democrats have called. Watch for small-ball answers trying to pick apart the credibility of certain witnesses when it comes to whether they extrapolated or had firsthand information on what they were testifying about. -- THEY’RE READY TO THROW SONDLAND UNDER THE BUS. This was, perhaps, the most surprising to us. Conventional wisdom held that SONDLAND was going to be the strongest ally for TRUMP -- a donor whose $1 million to the Trump inaugural fund should have made him a loyal figure. But Republicans are starting to turn on him. Lawmakers we spoke with called him a lackey, a chest-thumper and a rube. Of course, perhaps that’s because he turned on the president. But there is no love lost for Sondland at all. -- THEY STILL, TO THIS DAY, QUESTION THE QUID PRO QUO. The cornerstone of Republicans’ defense of TRUMP is that, despite testimony indicating otherwise, there is no actual evidence of a quid pro quo. There is talk that the president wanted to hold up aid in exchange for a statement laying out an investigation into the BIDEN family. But, as several lawmakers told us, the aid was restored without the statement.

According to the people familiar with the matter, he will say he tried to distance himself and the department from the matter by removing himself from email chains about Yovanovitch.” AP SMART STORY … WAPO’S ROBERT BARNES and SEUNG MIN KIM: “Senate impeachment trial to test chief justice who has tangled with Trump”: “The trial would be an unfamiliar moment in the spotlight for Roberts, 64, whose evocation of the judge as impartial umpire drew praise at his 2005 confirmation hearing. His nomination by President George W. Bush capped off a career as a Republican operative in the White House, a lawyer with many appearances before the Supreme Court and an appellate judge. “Trump’s impeachment proceedings would be the first trial over which Roberts has ever presided. It provides the potential for a confrontation with a president who has already antagonized him, even as the chief justice has tried to distance himself and the court from partisan politics. “‘I think [the chief justice] is going to be very uncomfortable with it,’ said Carter G. Phillips, a longtime Washington lawyer who is among the most prolific practitioners before the Supreme Court. ‘He will look the part and will act the part, but I’m sure he’d rather not have the part.’” WaPo JUICY … VANITY FAIR’S JOE POMPEO: “The Mask Will Probably Fall’: In a Warning, New Trump Scandals -- And Clues to the Identity of Anonymous” TRUMP’S WEDNESDAY -- The president will give a speech on federal judicial confirmation milestones at 3 p.m. in the East Room.

Under the new plan, troops would protect a large swath of land controlled by Syrian Kurdish fighters that stretches nearly 90 miles (150 kilometers) from Deir el-Zour to al-Hassakeh, but its exact size is still being determined. “Officials said many details still have to be worked out. But, Trump’s decision hands commanders a victory in their push to remain in the country to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group, counter Iran and partner with the Kurds, who battled IS alongside the U.S. for several years. But it also forces lawyers in the Pentagon to craft orders for the troops that could see them firing on Syrian government or Russian fighters trying to take back oil facilities that sit within the sovereign nation of Syria.” AP HAPPENING TODAY -- “In Major Nuclear Step, Iran to Resume Enrichment at Underground Site,” by WSJ’s Laurence Norman in Brussels and Aresu Eqbali in Tehran: “Iran plans to start enriching uranium at an underground facility Wednesday, Tehran officials said, in a significant step away from its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal that could raise pressure on Europe to take action. “A 15-year ban on any enrichment of uranium at the Fordow nuclear plant was one of the central achievements of the deal. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel for a nuclear weapon. “The site, buried deep within a mountain, is considered impregnable to most conventional weapons, presenting a major hurdle to any military effort aimed at stopping Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran says its nuclear program has always been for peaceful purposes.

89,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/2019-election-results-virginia-kentucky-bevin-trump-2020-908660/,"Welcome, Democrats cleaned house in Virginia and took down Kentucky’s GOP governor, but does that tell us anything about next November? Rolling Stone Washington bureau chief MICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA-EFE/Shutter WASHINGTON — Democrats cleaned house in Virginia, grabbing full control of the state government for the first time in decades. In Kentucky, an unpopular, Trump-endorsed Republican governor appears to have lost by the thinnest of margins. But Kentucky Republicans won every other statewide race, and an establishment Republican cruised past a moderate Democrat in the Mississippi governor’s race. Was Election Night 2019 a rebuke of President Trump after his failed intervention on behalf of Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin? Was it fresh evidence — looking at the Virginia and Kentucky results — that the Democratic path to victory in 2020 runs through the suburbs? Can we tell anything from what happened last night?

						4 Ways Venue Owners Can Connect With Audiences During the Pandemic					



						Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America Let’s start with Virginia. Democrats opened the year reeling from scandal. An old yearbook photo resurfaced apparently showing Gov. Ralph Northam (D) in blackface, followed by sexual assault allegations made against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and an admission by Attorney General Mark Herring that he, too, had once worn blackface. It helped of course that none of those three men were on the ballot Tuesday. But several bigger developments played into Democrats’ hands. A court threw out Virginia’s badly gerrymandered map for state legislative races; the new, fairer map meant more competitive races across the state. When Republicans refused to allow a debate on gun-safety legislation after the Virginia Beach mass shooting on May 31st, Democrats as well as outside groups including Everytown for Gun Safety saw an opportunity to use gun control — and the GOP’s deference to the NRA — as a winning issue. “What happened in Virginia Beach — and what didn’t happen afterward — set the stage for this election,” Everytown President John Feinblatt said on Wednesday. Feinblatt said Everytown invested $2.5 million in flipping legislative seats in Virginia this year and saw Tuesday’s sweeping victories as “a curtain-raiser for 2020.”  Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state-level races across the country, says she saw several notable trends in the results. One was that the growing disapproval of President Trump and Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party made it easier down-ballot Democratic candidates to hitch Republican candidates to Trump. “Trump was used more literally in mail pieces because he is closer to the Republican brand than he was in 2017,” Post says. That tighter link, she says, will have implications for state and congressional races next year. She also says Virginia’s blue sweep in Virginia tells another important story: Democrats have finally gotten their act together in state-level politics. During the eight years of Obama, Democrats lost a historic number of seats in state legislatures around the country. Those losses paved the way for gerrymandered election maps, rollbacks of reproductive rights, new voter suppression laws, and a host of other hardline, Koch-approved policies. It’s taken Democrats almost a decade to rebuild and regain ground in the states, but they’re close to pulling even: Going into Election Day 2019, Post says, Democrats trailed Republicans by just 202 state legislative seats nationwide. “There was this theory that if you invested in the top of ticket it would trickle down to down-ballot races — but that doesn’t work in economics and it doesn’t work in politics,” she says. “You have to invest early, run an incredible ground game, and support Democratic messages that voters want to vote for like gun safety, Medicaid expansion, and public education.”  Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University, says the Virginia results underscore what she calls a “realignment” underway in the state’s suburbs that has pushed Virginia more to the left. That realignment was driven by millennials and members of Generation Z who finished college, entered the workforce, and turned out to vote in the Trump era in a way they didn’t under Obama. That held true on Tuesday: Turnout in Virginia reportedly set a new record for a so-called off-off-year election. “The changing suburbs are like a demographic yule log that’s burning in the fire place,” Bitecofer says. “Right now, Trump is pouring kerosene all over that log.” In Kentucky, the picture is less clear, but there are still parallels to be found. At his rally in support of Bevin on Monday, President Trump said if Bevin lost “they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can’t let that happen to me!” On Wednesday, Trump took credit for the five out of six Republican victories in Kentucky — Bevin being the only loss. (Bevin, for his part, has yet to concede the race.) But calling Bevin’s defeat a referendum on Trump would overstate the case. Bevin killed the state’s popular health-care exchange, restricted access to Medicaid through new work requirements, and generally pushed to privatize government functions. By the time he stood for reelection, Bevin ranked as one of the least popular governors in America. Still, he appears to have lost by 5,100 votes to Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat and the son of former two-term governor Steve Beshear. When looked at that way — a roundly disliked governor barely losing to the scion of a Kentucky dynasty — it’s harder to pull any sweeping generalizations from the result. What’s worth noting, though, is a similar suburban shift on election night story in Kentucky. As MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki pointed out, the Kentucky-side suburbs of Cincinnati lurched leftward compared to the last gubernatorial election. Voter turnout surged as well in the suburbs of Louisville and Beshear won more voters there than Democrats had in recent elections.  So, what’s it all mean for next year? The week began with new polling from New York Times that suggests Trump remains popular and a formidable incumbent — regardless of the challenger — in battleground states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Think of Tuesday as a counterpoint of sorts: An unpopular and chaotic president continues to drag down his party in key parts of the electorate across the country, especially the suburbs. “There’s nothing localized about what happened in Virginia last night,” Rachel Bitecofer says. “Turnout went way, way up. It didn’t go up like that because of Medicaid expansion or gun control. It went up because people are unsettled about Donald Trump. People are freaked out.” In This Article:

Cat-ica! Cat-ica!
BEVIN LASHES HIMSELF TO TRUMP, SINKS ANYWAYLexington [Ky.] Herald Leader: “Kentucky voters rejected Gov. Matt Bevin Tuesday, bucking a statewide Republican trend as they turned their backs on a politician known as much for his blustery personality as his conservative values. Democrat Andy Beshear, who ran a campaign as the anti-Bevin and stuck to a script of ‘kitchen table issues’ — education, pensions, health care and jobs — declared a narrow victory over the incumbent governor. Bevin refused to concede the race. … Beshear’s apparent victory comes even as Bevin clinged tightly to President Donald Trump, with several administration officials visiting throughout Bevin’s campaign, including two visits from Trump himself. Trump’s inability to lift an unpopular Bevin in a state the president won by almost 30 percentage points creates a perception the president is weak as he heads into the 2020 elections and as talk of impeachment swirls in D.C.”What’s next? - Louisville Courier Journal: “The first step under Kentucky law is a recanvass of the vote, which is a review of the vote totals by each county clerk — counting absentee votes and checking printouts to make sure the numbers they transmitted to the State Board of Elections were correct. State law allows for a recanvassing if a county clerk or a county board of elections notices a discrepancy, or if a candidate makes a written request to the secretary of state.  ...the next possible step in the process under Kentucky law — a formal recount that includes a physical examination of the ballots. There is no provision for an automatic recount under Kentucky law. A candidate must file a petition with the Franklin Circuit Court by the Tuesday following the election. If petitioned, the judge would take possession of the paper ballots and voting machines and conduct their own recount. After doing so, the judge would make the final decision on who won the race, but that would be subject to appeal to the Kentucky Court of Appeals or the Kentucky Supreme Court.”Suburban Trump backlash leads Virginia Dems to historic win - NYT: “In capturing both chambers of the legislature in Virginia, Democrats have cleared the way for Gov. Ralph S. Northam, who was nearly driven from office earlier this year, to press for measures tightening access to guns and raising the minimum wage that have been stymied by legislative Republicans. … For the first time since 1993, Democrats control both chambers in the legislature and the governor’s office — allowing them to redraw the state’s legislative boundaries after next year’s census. Linking Republican incumbents to the unpopular president and criticizing them for opposing gun control measures in the aftermath of a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, Democratic challengers built their victory with strong showings in suburbs stretching from outside Washington to Richmond and Hampton Roads. In Fairfax County, the state’s largest jurisdiction, the last remaining Republican lawmaker was defeated.”Mississippi Republicans sweep statewide, first since Reconstruction - Jackson [Miss.] Clarion Ledger: “Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves won the race for Mississippi governor Tuesday night, defeating Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood. Republicans were on track Tuesday to control all statewide elected offices in Mississippi and are expected to maintain super-majority control of the Legislature. It will be the first time since Reconstruction that Republicans control all statewide elected offices in Mississippi. In incomplete and unofficial results, Reeves led Hood on Tuesday night 52% to 47%. After a race filled with attack ads, Reeves took a conciliatory tone in his victory speech in downtown Jackson. ‘I will try to do what is right for the future of Mississippi,’ Reeves said. ‘And I mean all the people of Mississippi.’”Republicans routed in Pennsylvania - Philadelphia Inquirer: “The political forces that shaped last year’s midterm elections showed no signs of abating Tuesday, as voters turned on Republicans and establishment Democrats alike in races from Philadelphia and Scranton to the suburbs of Delaware and Chester Counties. … Democrats will hold all five seats on the Delaware County Council, a Republican stronghold since the Civil War, and also assumed a majority on the legislative body in Chester County. In Bucks County, Democrats captured the Board of Commissioners for the first time since 1983. And in Philadelphia, a third-party insurgent candidate weakened an already marginalized GOP by securing one of the at-large City Council seats reserved for minority parties – a seat Republicans have held for decades.”Gonzales: Some lessons from Tuesday’s results - Roll Call: “Kentucky was not an upset. Inside Elections changed its rating on the governor’s race from Lean Republican to Toss-up in mid-July after finding Gov. Matt Bevin very vulnerable. So those who were surprised by Democrat Andy Beshear’s declared victory weren’t paying close enough attention. … Tuesday’s results continued to demonstrate GOP problems in the suburbs since Trump took office. The latest was in northern Kentucky in the Cincinnati suburbs, where Bevin won in 2015 and Beshear won in 2019. Or in northern Mississippi, in the Memphis suburbs where the GOP margin in DeSoto County dropped from 61 points to 20 points... These are just the latest pieces of evidence after Democrat Dan McCready’s overperformance in the Charlotte suburbs from 2018 to the 2019 special election in North Carolina’s 9th District. It should be particularly concerning for President Trump in his efforts to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, and Texas in 2020.”THE RULEBOOK: CHECK POINT
“To what purpose then require the co-operation of the Senate [when the president nominates individuals]? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 76TIME OUT: WHEN EINSTEIN BECAME EINSTEINSmithsonian: “When the year 1919 began, Albert Einstein was virtually unknown beyond the world of professional physicists. By year’s end, however, he was a household name around the globe. November 1919 was the month that made Einstein into ‘Einstein,’ the beginning of the former patent clerk’s transformation into an international celebrity. On November 6, scientists at a joint meeting of the Royal Society of London and the Royal Astronomical Society announced that measurements taken during a total solar eclipse earlier that year supported Einstein’s bold new theory of gravity, known as general relativity. Newspapers enthusiastically picked up the story. ‘Revolution in Science,’ blared the Times of London; ‘Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.’ A few days later, the New York Times weighed in with a six-tiered headline—rare indeed for a science story. ‘Lights All Askew in the Heavens,’ trumpeted the main headline. … The spotlight would remain on Einstein and his seemingly impenetrable theory for the rest of his life.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARD

Hale is expected to tell lawmakers that political considerations were behind the State Department's decision to withhold U.S. military aid from Ukraine.”McCarthy to adjust committee ahead of hearings - WaPo: “House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is planning to make a last-minute lineup change before open impeachment hearings of President Trump… Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) … is not a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, which Democrats last week voted to give the sole power to conduct public hearings. According to three Republicans familiar with the talks but not authorized to comment publicly, McCarthy (R-Calif.) is considering placing Jordan on the panel, as well as others — such as Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.)… Matt Sparks, a McCarthy spokesman, confirmed comments that McCarthy made Tuesday to Politico indicating that he planned to ‘make adjustments to that committee accordingly, for a short period of time’ during the impeachment proceedings. Sparks said [Rep. Devin] Nunes would remain the top Republican in any scenario.”More witnesses head to the Hill - AP: “Hale, who arrived Wednesday morning to testify behind closed doors, will also say that the State Department worried about the reaction from President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, also one of the strongest advocates for removing the ambassador. … Also scheduled to testify Wednesday was State Department Counselor T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, an adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and close friend of the secretary. But Brechbuhl did not appear, instead departing with Pompeo on a trip to Germany early Wednesday morning. Two other witnesses who were scheduled for Wednesday — Russ Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Rick Perry, the Energy secretary — also are not expected to show up. Both have strongly criticized the probe.”Senate GOP looks for ways to tar Bidens during impeachment - WaPo: “Senate Republicans are privately debating whether they should use an impeachment trial of President Trump to scrutinize former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter as some Trump allies push to call them as witnesses while others dismiss the suggestion as a risky political ploy. The ongoing discussions are a revealing glimpse into the fault lines in the GOP ahead of a possible trial of Trump in the Senate, where there are varying appetites among Republicans for the type of political combat relished by the president and his most ardent defenders. Among a group of Trump’s allies inside and outside Congress, there is intense and growing interest in countering the House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry by delving into Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine and China.”BUTTIGIEG HEALTH PLAN UNDER THE MICROSCOPENYT: “Mr. [Pete] Buttigieg, like others in the field, has a plan for expanding health insurance coverage to the uninsured. But he also has a plan for limiting the prices that hospitals and doctors can charge to patients, even if they get their insurance from a private company. Mr. Buttigieg’s approach is slightly complicated… But it is a policy clearly intended to lower medical prices. … His plan would cap medical costs in an indirect way. It would allow insurers and medical providers to agree on whatever prices they wish in a contract. But it would limit how much insurers have to pay when providers are ‘out of network.’ The limit, double what Medicare pays them, would help patients who end up at a place that is not covered by their insurance. But it will also tend to influence the negotiations between hospitals and insurance companies, putting downward pressure on in-network prices.”Galston: ‘Elizabeth Warren’s health-care hara-kiri’ - WSJ: “Ms. [Elizabeth] Warren should be commended for the wealth of detail in her plan, which allows voters to judge it for themselves. This said, she may well have penned the longest suicide note in recorded history. There’s no reason for the entire Democratic Party to sign it.”  PLAY-BY-PLAYMcConnell insists spending battle won’t deter Senate from confirming judges - WashTimesNYC voters adopt ranked-choice voting system - Fox NewsAUDIBLE: WHAT ABOUT A SWEATER FOR A SHOTGUN?
“The Trump presidency — it’s like every day is Christmas. You don’t know what’s under the tree. It can be that shotgun you’ve been hoping to get, or it can be a sweater you don’t want. ... There’s something under the tree. ... It makes it fun.” – Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in an interview with Politico.FROM THE BLEACHERS
“Why don't we have separate polls for both parties and another for independents? These uneven, slanted polls raise the possibility that they are predetermined to show a particular result by design. If we had 3 distinctly separate polls, we could see how strong (or weak) Trump is with registered Republicans and who the Democrats want.  The real useful poll though would be who the independents like, which takes us back to how worthless the polls really are, and that it all boils down to who gets out to vote in November.” – Tom Weekly, Gilbert, Ariz.
[Ed. note: Every poll we use does exactly that, Mr. Weekly. Good surveys break out the various partisan groups. But we need all three groups because: a) some voters go vote against their own party’s nominees and b) voters’ perceptions of themselves are apt to change over the course of time. Someone may consider themselves very independent today but by Election Day will have picked a side.]
“I have a prediction. Given: The house will proceed on full investigation for Trump impeachment. Sham or not they will use all means to channel the facts to support their coming up with their version of the articles of impeachment. They will effectively use the media to be the outlet of their opinion of the facts. So far so good. Pelosi will then ‘decide’ to formally draft the articles of impeachment but she will NOT call for a vote of the house on the articles. Her logic will be that they have all the ‘facts’ to support a vote and action by the Senate but since we are so close to the election she will leave it up to the voters to get Trump out of office because that is the democratic right way of doing it. Let the people decide. Regardless of the process used to gather the ‘facts,’ how the hearings are run, cherry picking the witnesses, determining what questions will be allowed, it will be out there for public consumption mostly one sided. No Senate trial to actually determine guilt or innocence but that won’t matter as it is the court of public opinion that will determine Trumps re-electability and the deck will be stacked. Just my silly, but I believe realistic, opinion and it has nothing to do with my political leaning. I just despise the entire process.” – Alan Edelkind, Dublin, N.H.
[Ed. note: I had not thought about that! Hearings but no vote! You could be on to something, Mr. Edelkind. I will explore this possibility further. It certainly would solve several problems for Democrats. I don’t know whether rank and file members would allow it, but it’s certainly quite an idea.]Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.CAT-ICA!

92,https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/06/stanford-students-compare-ben-shapiro-cockroach-flyer/,"(Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Politicon) A coalition of “concerned students” at Stanford are holding a silent rally against conservative journalist Ben Shapiro Thursday at 6 p.m. at the university’s famed Hoover Tower. That night, Shapiro will deliver a lecture to students in Memorial Auditorium. The theme of his speech is: “No, leftist idiots don’t get to raise my kids.” Stanford College Republicans said they invited him because of his prowess as a conservative intellectual. “We admire Shapiro’s intellectual consistency, honesty, and adherence to principle,” they wrote in The Stanford Review, the college’s independent newspaper, in a piece called Why We Invited Ben Shapiro. “He always delivers what he believes to be the unvarnished truth, even when it might be unpopular among other right-of-center commentators. Furthermore, Shapiro is courageous. Whether it means taking a pro-second amendment message to a hostile audience on CNN in the wake of a mass shooting or braving an angry mob seeking to shut down his lecture at Cal State LA, Ben Shapiro never shies away from boldly presenting his principles.” The protest flyer, meanwhile, includes roach spray called “Ben B Gon” with Shapiro’s picture emblazoned on the front in between a couple of roaches. Shapiro runs The Daily Wire and is also a longtime syndicated radio host. “We are tired of of Stanford Administration’s complicity in putting Black, Brown, Trans, Queer, and Muslim students at risk by allowing SCR to bring Ben Shapiro to campus,” the flyer reads. The Daily Caller’s “Mirror” blog sought comment from Shapiro. “They literally decry ‘hateful, dehumanizing ideas’ that ‘incite’ on a poster in which they compare me to an insect to be exterminated,” Shapiro told me by email. “Nothing says tolerance and diversity quite like actively depicting your political opponent, whose views you deliberately mischaracterize, as a bug.” The group portends that it’s not a matter of quelling anyone’s freedom of speech. “We don’t protest because we are too sensitive to hear opinions we don’t like,” they wrote. “We protest because we are strong enough to defend ourselves.” Attendees are encouraged to wear black. No doubt the group understands that the world’s protestors have notoriously been referred to as “cockroaches.” For example, Hong Kong police have called protestors “cockroaches.” During the genocide in Rwanda, Tutsis were called “cockroaches.” Jewish people have also been called cockroaches and Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew. Student Republicans expected as much. In May, 2019, BuzzFeed faced blowback for reporting that Shapiro had radicalized a Nazi. In March, The Economist apologized after referring to Shapiro as “alt-right.” “Every time, leftist activists work tirelessly to sabotage these events, ripping down our flyers, and harassing and intimidating our members,” they wrote in their aforementioned story. “Our events have been the target of walkouts, stink bombs, and even an attempt to chain, lock, and barricade the doors to the venue.” Last year, Twitter refused to suspend Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after he tweeted that Jews were like termites. (RELATED: Twitter Rules Louis Farrakhan Comparing Jews To Termites Doesn’t Violate Guidelines) The students behind this anti-Shapiro movement are outraged that Stanford’s administration would even allow him to speak there. (RELATED: You, Too, Can Meet Ben Shapiro, But It’ll Cost You) Comparing Shapiro to a cockroach is obviously disgusting, but if you haven’t seen The Daily Caller‘s “Shapirbro” comedy video, you must watch it now. Real life Shapiro apparently does not consume alcohol. “We would like to express disappointment, but not surprise, with the Stanford administration for continuing to put the safety of Black, Brown, Trans, Queer, and Muslim students at risk by allowing this event to happen,” they wrote. “Our protest is not about SCR’s right to free speech, it is about the violence that Ben Shapiro’s hateful, dehumanizing ideas incite against members of our community. This event has no place on this campus, much less in Stanford’s largest venue.” The group is highly offended by what they deem is Shapiro’s bigotry and hate speech. “We have chosen to protest this event in silence because many of our bodies are the antithesis to Shapiro’s hateful speech,” they wrote. “Ben Shapiro’s bigotry tells him that Black Americans are disproportionately locked up because of their culture, that people of Arab descent ‘like to bomb crap and live in open sewage,’ that Palestinians need to be subjected to forced population transfer, and that transgender people are inherently ‘mentally ill.’ Our real-world experiences, rooted in both fact and feeling, teach us otherwise.” The protestors signed off, writing, “With love, Coalition of Concerned Students.” Follow Betsy on Twitter",2019-11-06 14:04:48,Stanford Students Compare Ben Shapiro To A Cockroach On Protest Flyer,,18775,http://dailycaller.com

The “Louie” creator’s return to stand-up comedy over the last year has created one controversy after the next (from jokes about the Parkland shooting victims to masturbating, which just so happens to be the act at the center of his sexual misconduct), and it prompted one heated response from Judd Apatow. Following C.K.’s Parkland jokes in January, Apatow took to social media to call out the controversial comedian. “This hacky, unfunny, shallow routine is just a symptom of how people are afraid to feel empathy,” Apatow tweeted at the time. “It’s much easier to laugh at our most vulnerable than to look at their pain directly and show them love and concern. Louis C.K. is all fear and bitterness now. He can’t look inward.”  Apatow was recently interviewed by The Daily Beast and was asked to weigh in on Louis C.K.’s first major stand-up tour. Apatow maintained that he believes comedians should be allowed to discuss any subject, no matter how controversial, but it’s on the comedian to not talk about any subject “recklessly.” Related

					The Best Movies of 2021 So Far “I don’t think anybody should be boycotted or not be allowed to work at a club if they make a terrible joke about it,” Apatow said about mass shooting jokes, before adding that C.K.’s jokes became “especially offensive because [the Parkland survivors] were underage kids and they have suffered in a way that no one can ever understand.” C.K. has mostly avoided discussing his sexual misconduct on stage, which Apatow believes is a critical misstep. C.K. admitted to a history of masturbating in front of female comics but does not explicitly address his past during his comedy sets. Apatow says C.K. should learn from Aziz Ansari, who was also accused of sexual misconduct and confronted the allegation and his behavior during a tour that was filmed and released on Netflix in July. Ansari acknowledged the pain he caused the woman accusing him and expressed hope that the ordeal made him a better person. “I appreciate what Aziz did and a lot of us feel like, we wish Louis said that on day one,” Apatow tells The Daily Beast. “And why wouldn’t you say it? Why wouldn’t you say, ‘I hope people feel better, I’m trying to learn, I hope something good comes from this, I don’t want people to be in pain.’ It seems like the natural thing to say. Apatow continued, “I don’t know what he’s thinking. But he’s also made a point of not really telling people what he’s thinking. And when he doesn’t, it creates this vacuum and everyone has to try to debate it to figure out what he’s thinking. So that’s why there’s so much debate, because he’s not saying, ‘This is what I took from this experience.’”  Head over to The Daily Beast’s website to read Apatow’s interview in its entirety.

94,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/kentucky-governor-virginia-election.html,"Advertisement Supported by In Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, many voters in historically Republican suburbs supported Democratic candidates, in part because of antipathy toward President Trump. By Trip Gabriel, Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns RICHMOND, Va. — For the second Election Day in as many years, suburban voters demonstrated enormous political power in electing or aiding Democratic candidates in historically Republican areas, underscoring the drift of many moderate voters from the G.O.P. in the era of President Trump. In the Virginia suburbs of Norfolk, Richmond, and Washington, D.C., Democratic candidates flipped six legislative seats from Republican control on Tuesday — crucial gains that helped Democrats take control of both chambers of the legislature and put state government under one-party control for the first time in a generation. Many Democrats ran on gun control issues and other local concerns, but also excoriated Mr. Trump’s conduct in office. In suburbs around Philadelphia, which were battlegrounds in the 2016 election and will be again in 2020, Democrats notched historic wins. They defeated the last Republicans on the five-seat Delaware County Council, in a suburb that kept electing Republicans to local offices while rejecting many Republican statewide candidates, and they took control of the board of commissioners in Bucks County for the first time since the 1980s. And in the Kentucky governor’s race on Tuesday, Democrats carried the home counties of Louisville and Lexington by nearly triple the margin they ran up in the 2015 governor’s race. Four years ago, too, the Republican candidate for governor, Matt Bevin, carried the conservative Kentucky suburbs south of Cincinnati; this time around, two of those three counties broke for the Democratic candidate, Andy Beshear. Mr. Bevin, who was on the ballot this week seeking a second term as governor, is now about 5,100 votes behind Mr. Beshear, who has claimed victory. Mr. Bevin on Wednesday formally asked state officials to undertake a check and recanvass of the voting machines and absentee ballots in the race, citing “irregularities” without providing details. For Mr. Trump and other Republican leaders, the ongoing political realignment of the suburbs — which was essential to Democrats flipping Republican-held congressional seats in 2018 and retaking the House — is a disconcerting disadvantage that they have shown little ability to reverse. Democratic officials, in turn, increasingly believe they can press a center-left agenda with little risk of backlash because moderate voters will remain in their grip as long as Mr. Trump is in office and effectively make the G.O.P. a no-go zone for this demographic. “Our coalition is growing and is more secure,” said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, before quickly adding that Democrats cannot take their new voters for granted. “You have to earn it,” said Ms. Raimondo, counseling her party’s candidates to avoid ideological purity tests and instead focus on conveying to voters “that we’re going to do a better job making their lives easier.” But she couldn’t help noting one factor behind the party’s good fortune. “Even some Republicans are just done with President Trump,” she said. For his part, Mr. Trump focused on other Republican victories in Kentucky on Tuesday night, an implicit nod to Mr. Bevin’s own unpopularity with voters. He also argued that his rally in Kentucky on Monday night had helped Mr. Bevin gain “at least 15 points in last days.” In truth, every public and private poll showed a single-digit contest in the final weeks of the race. In interviews on Wednesday afternoon in the suburbs of Richmond, several voters said they had decided to cast ballots for Democrats in part because of their frustration with Mr. Trump. Katie Morris, a grant writer, said she didn’t “have a problem with the conservative agenda” and usually voted Republican. But no longer. “In general, I am very turned off by the way our country is going,” Ms. Morris said, the day after voters in her district west of Richmond elected the first Muslim woman to the State Senate — Ghazala Hashmi, a Democrat who will replace a Republican incumbent. “In general these days I’m pretty liberal-leaning as a result of Trump,” Ms. Morris said. But another voter, Martha Grattan, was feeling plenty ideological on Wednesday after the Republicans she supports had fared badly. Asked what was on her mind as she cast her ballot, she said, “Next year.” “I want Republicans to be put back in office next year,” she added, referring to Mr. Trump and G.O.P. members of Congress. For decades, these suburbs were cornerstones of the Republican electoral coalition, a vital constituency for conservative candidates seeking to overcome Democrats’ popularity in densely populated cities and populist rural precincts. But these areas have steadily shifted away from the G.O.P. as the party has come to be defined less by its traditional center-right agenda — like taxes and public safety — than by the preoccupations of rural white conservatives, on matters like protecting gun rights, restricting abortion and cracking down on illegal immigration. Mr. Trump’s election in 2016 drastically accelerated that migration away from the Republican Party, spurring an exodus of already-uneasy moderate voters away from a party defined by Mr. Trump’s caustic persona and hard-right views on race and immigration. Each year since Mr. Trump took office has brought new evidence of his party’s decline in these areas, rich with college-educated voters and upwardly mobile communities of immigrants and young people. In 2009, in the first year of Mr. Obama’s presidential term, the suburbs of Northern Virginia propelled the G.O.P. to a sweep of the statewide offices. Eight years later, it was Democrats who rolled through counties like Fairfax and Loudoun to seize all of the state’s constitutional offices by wide margins. There was no sign in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states this week that Republicans are close to containing the damage Mr. Trump has done in these kinds of areas, let alone reversing it. Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, emerged from Election Day with the optimism that they are building on the gains they made in the 2018 midterms. A year after Democrats claimed 40 House seats and a series of governorships thanks to a surge of support from suburbanites, the results in Virginia in particular make clear that their drift from the G.O.P. won’t be easily reversed. Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, made clear on Wednesday that he plans to take advantage of the historic shift from red to blue in his state, showing no signs of worry that Democrats might pay a price at the ballot box in 2020 if they push an aggressive policy agenda. In an open meeting of his cabinet, Mr. Northam said “we have a unique opportunity in the next two years,” saying “the landscape has changed” and that he planned to push for a major new package of gun control policies, criminal justice reform, early childhood education, the decriminalization of marijuana and greater access to health services. He particularly zeroed in on gun legislation, a divisive issue in parts of once-red Virginia but a political priority for many suburban voters. “I really think a large part of the results that we saw yesterday were Virginians saying they’ve had enough,” Mr. Northam said. He noted that he called a special session of the General Assembly in July to consider eight gun measures, following a mass shooting in Virginia Beach that took 12 lives, but Republicans called it a stunt and quickly voted to adjourn. “We had less than 90 minutes of dialogue, with no results,” Mr. Northam said. Ms. Hashmi, the victorious candidate for State Senate outside Richmond, had focused much of her campaign on enacting new gun control restrictions. Everytown for Gun Safety, former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s gun control organization, contributed $102,000 to her campaign, while the National Rifle Association did not contribute to her Republican opponent’s campaign. Everytown said it gave $2.5 million to back Democrats in Virginia. The N.R.A. gave $350,269 to Republican candidates and organizations, according to state campaign finance records. Mr. Beshear, the Kentucky Democrat, also asserted himself politically on Wednesday, saying he would push ahead with a transition to power and would soon start naming members to his cabinet and filling other roles in his administration. At a news conference, though, he stuck to a conciliatory message of bridging political divides in Kentucky by focusing on issues where there was common ground — the kind of messaging that many suburban voters like to hear. “Last night, the election ended,” Mr. Beshear told reporters, standing with members of a local teachers union in the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville. He noted a looming deadline to submit a state budget in January. “The politics part of this is over,” he added. “It’s time for governance.” Mr. Beshear declined to extrapolate any lessons for the broader Democratic Party based on his success in Kentucky. Indeed, he strained to avoid tying himself to national political issues and focused narrowly on the statewide issues that had been at the heart of Mr. Bevin’s unpopularity as governor, like public education, pensions for public employees and health care. “I’m not worried about what national pundits or what national Democrats are saying,” Mr. Beshear said. “I’m worried about our families here in Kentucky and doing a good job for them.” He added, “I believe this race is about our families wanting someone that cares about them, that reflects their values and is focused on those issues that they are anxious about at the end of the day.” In Virginia, several voters made clear that they, too, wanted politicians to focus on state and local issues, though some were also focused on Washington. In interviews, some voters said their passions were not so much aimed at impeaching Mr. Trump, as at wanting the president to act more presidential, and for Congress to work together to move the country forward. Schuyler VanValkenburg, a Democrat re-elected to his House seat in Henrico County, which he first won in 2017 in the first phase of a blue wave that has reshaped the politics of the suburbs under Mr. Trump, said suburban voters are less partisan than many people assume. “Henrico County is not an ideological place,” he said. “Educational opportunity for their children and the chance of a better life for the next generation are what people care about.” It’s also increasingly diverse. The school district where Mr. VanValkenburg teaches 12th-grade government includes students who together speak more than 80 languages. Voters, he said, “want pragmatic, sound governance.” “What we’ve seen is a Republican Party that’s becoming increasingly ideological,” he said.

95,https://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/funds-stock-gun-companies/2019/11/06/id/940465,"By Newsmax Finance Staff    |  
Wednesday, 06 November 2019 05:24 PM U.S.-based open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds reportedly own nearly a third of the stock in America’s two publicly traded gun companies, even as Main Street investors are avoiding such shares. The only two remaining gun-company stocks in the U.S. are Sturm Ruger (RGR) and American Outdoor Brands Corp. (AOBC), owner of gun maker Smith & Wesson. Funds hold about 30% of the two companies’ combined shares, according to data compiled in late October for the Wall Street Journal by fund tracker Morningstar Inc. There are some 201 funds invested in one or both of the companies, mostly small-cap funds, reflecting the companies’ market capitalization. In the wake of numerous mass shootings, the number of investors asking to screen out gun stocks from their portfolios “has noticeably increased over the last few years,” Andrew Wetzel, portfolio manager at F.L. Putnam Investment Management Co., a New England advisory with more than $2.2 billion under management, told WSJ.com. Gun company stocks typically trade higher after mass shootings as consumers may step up purchases to get ahead of potential regulatory changes that could make it more difficult to obtain guns. Investor scrutiny of gun makers picked up after last year’s mass shooting at a Florida high school and has continued through more recent attacks, including in Texas and Ohio in August. Several large banks last year limited financing for gun makers and retailers, but the move had little impact on an industry whose many small manufacturers are able to tap other sources of credit, Reuters explained. At gun maker annual meetings last year, top asset managers voted in favor of shareholder calls for safety reports, but also backed directors. At its annual shareholder meeting this fall, American Outdoor, parent of Smith & Wesson, will face a shareholder call for the company to adopt a “human rights” policy the company says is vague and could expose it to liability. Morningstar director Jon Hale said worried investors could relax about gun makers that make up tiny fractions of big index funds, which account for most of the gun makers’ top investors. More important is the pressure fund firms can bring on gun makers, he said. The outcome of owning gun stocks in a diversified index fund, Hale said, “is a de minimis impact on your portfolio.”   © 2021 Newsmax Finance. All rights reserved.

96,http://feeds.mashable.com/~r/Mashable/~3/Eh18i2sH_jo/,"Airbnb has announced plans to verify every single one of its approximately 7 million listings after a mass shooting at an Airbnb in October, alongside several other safety initiatives. The shooting took place at a Halloween party thrown at a California Airbnb, leaving five dead and prompting Airbnb Co-Founder, CEO, and Head of Community Brian Chesky to declare a ban on ""party houses"". Chesky also tweeted about several other safety initiatives, including ""expanding manual screening of high-risk reservations"" and a ""dedicated 'party house' rapid response team"", though he was somewhat light on details. Now we have a clearer idea of exactly what Airbnb's response will entail, with Chesky outlining several ways the company will improve the safety of their listings in an email to Airbnb employees on Wednesday. The most notable announcement is that Airbnb aims to have every host and listing on their site verified by 15 December 2020. That's around 7 million properties that need to be checked, not only for accuracy of the listing but for quality, cleanliness and safety. Speaking at The New York Times' DealBook Conference on Wednesday, Chesky said that verification would be carried out by ""a combination of the company and the community."" ""I think many of us in this industry over the last 10 years are going from a hands-off model where the internet's an immune system to realizing that's not really enough,"" said Chesky. ""That we have to take more responsibility for the stuff on our platform, and I think this has been a gradual — maybe too gradual — transition for our industry."" If a guest checks into a listing only to find it doesn't meet Airbnb's standards after December 15, the company will book them into a different Airbnb ""of equal or greater value."" If there are none available, the company will instead offer a complete refund. This should be at least some comfort to travelers who fly halfway around the world only to find their Airbnb is less ""cozy cottage"" and more ""dilapidated shack."" Airbnb will also launch a 24-hour emergency hotline in the U.S. by the end of this year, rolling out globally in 2020. The Neighbour Hotline will be manned by actual people, who will undergo a training program developed under the advice of two former police chiefs. The rapid response team will aim to deal with complaints ""in a timely manner,"" though it isn't clear exactly what they'll do in the event of an unauthorized party since they presumably won't be actual cops. Finally, Airbnb announced that, starting December 15 in the U.S. and rolling out globally in 2020, they will be manually reviewing every high-risk reservation in order to prevent house parties. High-risk reservations will be detected by their ""risk detection models"", which looks at factors such as the length of the stay, the size of the property, and where the guest is coming from. ""So for example, if a single person books a 10-room home, for that night in the city they live in, that is a very high-risk reservation,"" said Chesky. ""I think that ultimately technology has its limits, at least technology today, and so you have to put a lot more humans behind it in the review."" Vice noted in a recent report that the company's failure to satisfactorily verify hosts' identities allowed scammers to operate unchecked, an issue exacerbated by poor customer support. Hopefully the company's new initiatives will go some way to rectifying this, as well as making Airbnbs safer overall. More in

Newly elected lawmakers are promising big changes that could reshape the state. Loading... November 6, 2019 Virginia Democrats promised swift action on a host of liberal policy proposals now that they've won full control of state government for the first time in more than two decades. Democratic leaders said Virginians should expect a higher minimum wage, new gun restrictions, and greater abortion rights after their party flipped control of the state House and Senate in Tuesday's election. They also promised ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. With Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam already in office, Democrats will now have full control of the statehouse for the first time in 26 years. ""Tomorrow the work begins and the people want to see results,"" Sen. Dick Saslaw, poised to be the next Senate majority leader when lawmakers return to the Capitol in January, told supporters at a victory party in Richmond. ""And let me tell you, for God's sake, they're going to get results."" Tuesday's victory extended the Democrats' winning streak under President Donald Trump. Suburban voters turned out in big numbers to back Democratic candidates, continuing a trend of once GOP-friendly suburbs turning blue. This is the third election in a row in which Virginia Democrats made significant gains since President Donald Trump was elected. The Democrats' big win was a warning sign for the president and Republicans ahead of next year's election. Higher-educated and more affluent suburban voters – particularly women – have revolted against Trump's GOP both in Virginia and nationwide. The suburbs leaned Republican in the past but have become a key battleground amid shifting demographics and Trump's turbulent presidency. Tuesday was a rough night for many suburban Republicans in Virginia. Del. Tim Hugo lost his spot as the last Republican representing Fairfax County, northern Virginia's most populous suburban jurisdiction. Of the four states with legislative elections this year, Virginia was the only one where control of the statehouse was up for grabs. Republicans lost their slim majorities in both the state House and Senate. National groups, particularly those aligned with Democrats, pumped huge amounts of money into the contests to test-drive expensive messaging and get-out-the-vote campaigns ahead of the 2020 balloting. Gun control and clean-energy groups affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent several million dollars helping Democrats. Virginia also drew several high-profile visits from 2020 presidential hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as current Vice President Mike Pence. President Donald Trump tried to rally Republicans via Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, a state he lost in 2016. The only candidate Mr. Trump endorsed by name, Republican Geary Higgins, was handily defeated in a northern Virginia Senate district previously held by the GOP. Gary Keener and wife Marthanne Huffines-Keener, of Glen Allen, a suburb just north of Richmond, said they voted Republican for years but have voted Democrat since the 2008 election of former President Barack Obama. They said Mr. Trump definitely had a large impact on Virginia's election. ""We didn't want to make that our only reason for coming out,"" Mr. Keener said. ""But he's a baboon. We do some traveling, and wherever we go, we're embarrassed."" Republicans hoped an off-year election with no statewide candidates on the ballot would help defuse the anti-Trump energy that powered previous cycles. GOP lawmakers also bet on the specter of a possible Trump impeachment providing a last-minute surge by motivating the Republican base. Republicans were able to hold on to several seats in close races but expressed disappointment with the overall outcome of the night. House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert on Tuesday predicted that Democrats would pursue an ""extreme agenda"" that would undo Republican efforts to make Virginia a business-friendly state. ""Virginians should expect public policies that look a lot more like the train-wreck that is California than the Virginia of good fiscal management and common-sense conservative governance,"" Mr. Gilbert said in a statement. Democrats were keenly focused on gun issues during the election, saying Republicans should be held accountable for failing to pass new restrictions after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach earlier this year. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to use the tragedy for political gain while focusing heavily on past Democratic efforts to loosen restrictions for third-trimester abortion. The Democratic victories Tuesday will make the legislature more diverse. Sen.-elect Ghazala Hashmi is the first Muslim-American woman to serve in the Senate. Del. Danica Roem, who made history as the first openly transgender person elected and seated in a U.S. state legislature, easily won reelection. Jenne Nurse, a 25-year-old who recently accepted a state government job, said she's excited about the increasing diversity. ""It's nice to see the Virginia Legislature look like Virginia. It's so important,"" said Ms. Nurse, who is black. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Tuesday's election could help cement Democratic rule for the next decade, because the winners will decide who controls the next redistricting process. Lawmakers approved a proposed constitutional amendment this year that would create a new bipartisan commission empowered to draw legislative and congressional maps. Democrats have to sign off on it again next year before presenting it to voters.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

The vote was unanimous after protesters packed a council meeting Tuesday night. Many wore stickers declaring that “poverty is not a crime.” One man held a sign saying, “Jesus was a panhandler.” The amendment would’ve criminalized passing money or objects through car windows to someone on a public road. It was tacked onto an ordinance that requires panhandlers be jailed for at least two days. That ordinance still stands. It was unanimously passed in July but has yet to be enforced or signed by Mayor Todd Strange, who’s in the final days of his term. Mayor-elect Steven Reed takes over the office next Tuesday. Anchorage: Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus has the option to reduce or cover the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly. KTUU-TV reports the university says it will take donations for its annual payment tradition until Friday to help combat student hunger. Officials say the food goes to students in need. University officials say each person may use PB&J payments for two citations issued within the past 45 days. Officials say two 16-ounce jars offer a $10 credit, three jars offer a $35 credit, and five jars offer a $60 credit. Officials say any unopened commercially produced nut butter – almond, cashew, peanut – or any flavor jam, jelly, marmalade or preserves will be accepted. Tucson: Voters in one of the state’s most liberal cities rejected an initiative Tuesday that would have created the state’s only sanctuary city amid concerns that it went too far in restricting police officers. The measure drew fierce opposition from the mayor and city council, all of them Democrats, who said the initiative risked public safety and millions of dollars the city gets from the state and federal governments. The measure was pushed by activists who wanted to give a voice to Tucson’s Latino community. They said it would have sent the message that immigrants are safe and protected in Tucson at a time when many are fearful of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Officials said Tucson police have already adopted rules that go as far as legally possible to restrict officers from enforcing federal immigration laws. Helena-West Helena: The city is shelving a plan to establish a 24-hour curfew in high-crime neighborhoods. Helena-West Helena officials have discussed instituting the measure after three homicides in two days last month. Police Chief James Smith said at the time that he planned to put the issue on the City Council agenda at a meeting Tuesday. But the city is now delaying a decision. Mayor Kevin Smith told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Tuesday that one problem with implementing such a plan is the shortage of facilities for holding people who get arrested as a result of increased police activity. Smith said Helena-West Helena will focus on high-crime areas using current laws and will increase officer training. The city already has a curfew for minors. Los Angeles: Police say they recovered $800,000 worth of prints by Scottish abstract expressionist Benjamin Creme after a caller told them they were in their San Fernando home. Police believe the 1,200 signed prints were there for several years, but the person who had them only recently checked a law-enforcement database and discovered they were stolen. Detectives said Tuesday that the caller, who was not identified, told them they were found in a late relative’s storage locker. They include “Flame-Coloured Deva,” “Shakti II” and other works by Creme, who in later years became better known for his belief in UFOs and predictions of a second coming of Christ and other messiahs. He died in 2016. Grand Junction: A former U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who pleaded guilty to selling Colorado bobcat pelts to fur traders has been sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $55,100 in fines and restitution. During a hearing Tuesday in Grand Junction, U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger also ordered Thad Bingham never to use or possess a firearm again, including weapons he transferred to his wife. He had faced up to 18 months in prison. The Daily Sentinel reports his lawyer, Ashley Petrey, asked for leniency since he lost his job and won’t be able to hunt again. Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Evans said Bingham has two previous poaching convictions and hasn’t learned his lesson. He said Bingham has more than $1 million in assets, enabling him to pay a high fine. Enfield: A group of prisoners is learning to cope with issues such as post-traumatic stress by interacting with horses. The equine-assisted psychotherapy program is offered in a special Department of Correction unit for military veterans at the Willard-Cybulski Correctional Institution in Enfield. Daniel Elliot, who suffered a brain injury while in the Navy, is serving time for an arson he committed while trying to kill himself inside his Norwich apartment. Elliot says the program, run at no charge to the state by the group Healing Hoofbeats, calms him, has helped him open up about his problems and gives him something to look forward to each week. Elliot is one of six inmates participating in the pilot program, which Correction Commissioner Rollin Cook says he hopes to expand to other prisons. Wilmington: A controversial “blight bill” has suffered another setback in the City Council despite a twist designed to appease critics. With the measure beset for three years by opposition from homeowner, landlord and tenant advocates, council members on Thursday again planned to compromise on the legislation intended to crack down on the owners of vacant and blighted properties. Again, the attempt appeared to fail. The bill passed a committee this week but was pulled from the City Council agenda Wednesday morning. Bill sponsor Bud Freel did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After making concessions to homeowners but still facing pushback from other property owners, Freel had planned to push for a vote Thursday – this time with a provision that the changes would be temporary. Washington: Most of the D.C. Council is asking Councilman Jack Evans to resign after a third party released its investigation into allegations of ethics violations. News outlets report the council-hired law firm O’Melveny & Myers publicly released its investigation into Evans this week, saying he violated the council’s ethics rules 11 times since 2014. It says he repeatedly used his office to benefit private clients who paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars, payments that he failed to disclose or recognize as conflicts of interest. Such allegations also are under investigation by federal authorities and have already cost Evans his role as chair of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Evans’ attorneys released a 67-page rebuttal Tuesday saying the law firm’s report is flawed and misunderstands council ethics rules. Tallahassee: Tourist haven Key West wants to protect coral reefs that attract divers, so it’s banning sunscreens that contain chemicals that could harm them. But state lawmakers who think it’s more important to protect humans are moving toward outlawing the island’s sunscreen ban and making sure no other local governments impose similar ordinances. The battle pits local governments against state government and environmentalists against dermatologists in an argument about coral bleaching and skin cancer. A bill sponsored by Sen. Rob Bradley has been approved in two committees and has one more stop before reaching the full state Senate. An identical House bill was set to make the first of three committee stops Wednesday. The sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate in Key West will be illegal starting in 2021. Atlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp released a plan Monday to expand Medicaid to the state’s poorest able-bodied adults, on the condition that they work, volunteer, receive job training or attend school. Under Kemp’s proposal, which is more limited than efforts in other states, uninsured adults in Georgia who make no more than the federal poverty level would qualify for Medicaid assistance if they spent at least 80 hours a month working, volunteering, training or studying. They would also have to pay monthly premiums. The federal poverty level is just under $12,500 for an individual. The governor’s office called the approach a “conservative reform” that reflects the state’s values as a place that “honors work” and “champions individual responsibility.” It would require approval from the Trump administration. Lihue: The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission. The Garden Island reports the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai. Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information. Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions. Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022. Boise: A giant forest project in the state that was rejected by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is on again, and an environmental group says it violates the court’s orders and vows it will stop it with another lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service on Friday approved the 125-square-mile project on the Payette National Forest, with work expected to start this week. The Forest Service and the Alliance for the Wild Rockies agree the project is precisely the same as the one halted by the 9th Circuit Court’s ruling against the Forest Service in August 2018. But the Forest Service says changes in wording in an environmental review remove problems that caused the court to stop the project, and the Forest Service’s new approval decision Friday allows work to begin immediately. Springfield: The state is receiving federal money to help build infrastructure for alternative-fuel vehicles along Interstate 80. The Illinois Department of Transportation says the grant is part of an effort to create an alternative-fuel corridor that supports electric vehicles and vehicles that run on natural gas. It will span six states, from New Jersey to the Iowa-Nebraska border. The $70,000 in federal funds will be combined with $10,000 each from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The money will be used to identify gaps along Interstate 80 where fueling and charging facilities aren’t available and to provide those options. Omer Osman, acting secretary of IDOT, says that “these improvements will help make interstate travel on alternative fuel a reality” and make travel more environmentally friendly. Indianapolis: The state will be home to the nation’s newest National Guard cyber battalion. State officials say the 127th Cyber Battalion will be composed of about 100 soldiers who will be trained in cybersecurity and cyber warfare at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, about 75 miles southeast of Indianapolis. Army National Guard officials say they chose Indiana’s force for its existing cyber capabilities, partnerships with industry and academia, and the ability to recruit and retain soldiers. Gov. Eric Holcomb says the state is a “natural fit” for the first cyber battalion in the Midwest. The battalion is expected to be fully operational by 2022. There are four other cyber battalions in the country: two in Virginia, one in South Carolina and another in Massachusetts. Newton: Joy, the American Mini Spokes-Pig for the Capitol II Theatre, has been recognized for her talents by Guinness World Records. In the 2020 edition of the famous record book, Joy was officially named the fastest trick porker in the universe. Her feat, overseen by two judges – Newton’s mayor and the city’s chief of police – was successfully completing 13 tricks, each initiated by a different command, in under a minute. A ham in more ways than one, Joy is a local celebrity and performer with her own dressing room at the theater – a peek-a-boo window lets visitors steal a gander of her from the street. And Joy is always red-carpet ready, of course, complete with painted toenails and her favorite dress, a resplendent taffeta number emblazoned with cartoon popcorn buckets (her favorite food). Topeka: The acting secretary of the state Department of Corrections said during his confirmation hearing that a mass commutation of offenders was worth considering. The Wichita Eagle reports Jeff Zmuda was asked to comment Tuesday on what happened one day earlier, when more than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma as part of a massive commutation. Zmuda said Kansas officials are looking at several ways to make reforms and ease overcrowding, and “that’s certainly one that could be considered.” Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning said releasing nonviolent inmates “sounds like a fantastic idea” but cautioned that if someone who has been released early commits a violent act, “there’s hell to pay.” The hearing ended with a Senate committee recommending that Zmuda be confirmed. The full Senate will vote early next year. Frankfort: State Senate President Robert Stivers threw another wrench into a razor-thin gubernatorial outcome late Tuesday night, saying the Legislature could decide the race. Stivers’ comments came shortly after Gov. Matt Bevin refused to concede to Attorney General Andy Beshear, who led by roughly 5,100 votes when all the precincts were counted. Stivers, R-Manchester, said based on his staff’s research, the decision could come before the GOP-controlled Legislature. Under state law, Bevin has 30 days to formally contest the outcome once it is certified by the State Board of Elections. Candidates typically ask for a recanvass of voting machines and a recount first. The last contested governor’s race was the 1899 election of Democrat William Goebel. Stivers said he believes most of the votes that went to Libertarian John Hicks, who received about 2% of the total vote, would have gone to Bevin and made him the clear winner. Baton Rouge: Three months after medical marijuana became available in the state, doctors and clinics say some patients are finding the cost for therapeutic cannabis too high for treatment, pricing them out of a medication they waited years to obtain. Nine pharmacies dispense medicinal-grade pot and set their individual prices. Dispensary owners say their charges reflect an industry with startup charges, small patient numbers and lengthy regulatory hurdles to meet. In August, Louisiana became the first Deep South state to dispense medical marijuana, four years after state lawmakers agreed to give patients access. Kathryn Thomas, CEO of The Healing Clinics, says a third of the medical marijuana patients across its five clinics in Shreveport, Monroe, Baton Rouge, Houma and Lafayette can’t foot the bill for the product. Augusta: It’s almost safe to be a turkey in Maine again. The Pine Tree State’s fall wild turkey season ends for the year Thursday. The fall turkey hunt is the longer of the state’s two turkey hunts, with a more restricted season taking place every spring. Wild turkeys are popular game birds, and the state uses the hunt to control their population. The animals were once rare in Maine but are now so common that they sometimes cause traffic accidents and other hazards. Hunters are allowed to take up to five wild turkeys of either sex in some parts of the state. However, parts of far northern Maine are closed to turkey hunting. Rockville: Departments and agencies in Montgomery County are embarking on a campaign to make residents aware of the added challenges of the switch to standard time. The approximately 20 planned “Be Safe, Be Seen” events, the first of which was held Wednesday at the Shady Grove Metro Station, are aimed at both adults and children. The campaign will distribute safety literature, reflective stickers, and items that will remind people to avoid distractions and maximize safe behaviors and visibility, especially in darkness. A 2016 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration showed that 26% of all pedestrian deaths occurred between 6 p.m. and 8:59 p.m. Because peak evening commuting times in fall and winter occur during periods of increased darkness, danger is increased. Boston: First lady Melania Trump on Wednesday visited a hospital that uses cuddling to help infants born dependent on drugs or alcohol. She met with caregivers and administrators at Boston Medical Center and told them she’s “very focused” on their pioneering work with babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. “I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours,” she said, joined by Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services. Outside, as many as 200 workers at the hospital gathered to protest the visit, condemning the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump’s administration that they say discourage immigrants from getting health care. Some wore white hospital jackets with the slogan “We really do care, do you?” on the backs. Others carried signs that read, “BMC cares for all patients.” Traverse City: A new forecast says Great Lakes levels are likely to remain unusually high and may set additional records. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office in Detroit on Monday released its outlook for the next six months. Hydrologist Keith Kompoltowicz says a wet October interrupted the usual fall drop-off of water levels. Storms over Lakes Michigan, Huron and Superior caused beach erosion, flooding, and damage to seawalls and roads. Kompoltowicz says all five Great Lakes are expected to resume their seasonal decline. But they’ll remain well above normal and will be higher in January than they were at the beginning of this record-setting year. He says Huron and Michigan are likely to set monthly records in February, while Superior will come close. Kompoltowicz says a lengthy dry spell would be required to reverse the trend. St. Paul: Winter anglers on Mille Lacs Lake will be allowed to keep one walleye this winter for the fourth season in a row. The Department of Natural Resources announced winter regulations for Mille Lacs on Monday. Similar to last winter, anglers can keep one walleye starting Dec. 1 if it’s between 21 and 23 inches, or over 28. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen says there’s evidence the state’s conservative approach to managing the popular lake is paying off. A fall assessment found the Mille Lacs walleye population has remained relatively stable over the past three years, having rebounded from lows seen from 2012 through 2016. Fisheries chief Brad Parsons says they expect the walleye bite on Mille Lacs to be quite good this winter, which will likely result in a high harvest. Pascagoula: A new historical marker is honoring the oldest continuously operating African American church in the state. Members of St. Peter Baptist Church in Pascagoula gathered Saturday to celebrate the unveiling of a marker that was placed by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The coastal church was founded in 1819 by a freed slave named Dudley Brooks. It originally was called First Free Mission Baptist Church. Pastor William H. Marshall tells WLOX-TV that he’s pleased the congregation is being recognized by the state. Congregants buried a time capsule with church programs and other items. The plan is to dig it up in 20 years. Kansas City: Voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved removing Dr. Martin Luther King’s name from one of the city’s most historic boulevards, less than a year after the City Council decided to rename the Paseo for the civil rights icon. Unofficial results showed the proposal to remove King’s name received nearly 70% of the vote, with just over 30% voting to retain King’s name. The city had been one of the largest in the country without a street named for him. But a group of residents intent on keeping the Paseo name began collecting petitions to put the name change on the ballot and achieved that goal in April. The campaign has been divisive. Emotions reached a peak Sunday, when members of the “Save the Paseo” group staged a silent protest at a get-out-the-vote rally at a black church. Billings: The speed limit on a deadly stretch of U.S. 212 in southeast Montana has been reduced to 65 mph. The Billings Gazette reports the Montana Department of Transportation lowered the speed limit Oct. 1 on the highway’s corridor that passes through both the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Reservations and four counties: Big Horn, Rosebud, Powder River and Carter. The stretch merges with Interstate 90 at the Bighorn Battlefield interchange and travels 167 miles east to the Montana-Wyoming state line. MDOT Traffic and Safety Bureau chief Gabe Priebe says statistics show the stretch is the deadliest highway in Montana. Bellevue: Speakers at a public hearing have criticized a proposal that could lead to the firing of elected officials in this Omaha suburb for leaking information from closed meetings. The first proposal says dissemination of information from closed sessions by an elected official could result in an “allegation of misconduct.” The second proposal says a finding of misconduct could result in that official’s removal from office. Former Bellevue Councilman Jim Moudry said at Tuesday night’s hearing that he was troubled by the notion the city would be able to decide what behaviors constitute misconduct. Councilman Chuck Fredrick and other said such decisions belong to voters. Councilwoman Kathy Welch backed the proposals, saying the city holds employees to high standards when conducting city business, so it should be no different for elected officials. Las Vegas: Despite protests about a “war on the poor,” city officials passed a law Wednesday making it illegal for the homeless to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters. The issue spurred emotion and drama, including the ejection by city marshals of several audience members whom Mayor Carolyn Goodman deemed disruptive during a daylong City Council meeting that drew dozens of time-limited comments. Most people spoke against the law before the 5-2 council vote. The measure will apply to the city’s downtown urban core, not the tourist-heavy Las Vegas Strip, which is overseen by a different jurisdiction. Goodman, the sponsor of the measure, called it imperfect but necessary to deal with what officials and downtown business owners characterize as a homeless crisis. Concord: The Division of Historical Resources has added eight properties to its historic register, including five from Litchfield’s town center. The buildings along Route 3A include the Gothic Revival Litchfield Presbyterian Church; the Greek Revival Town Hall; the Tudor Revival Aaron Cutler Memorial Library; the Colonial Revival Griffin Memorial School; and the Litchfield Fire Station. The church and town hall go back to the mid-1800s. Other properties include the George Burrell residence in Keene, an 1853 predominantly brick Italianate-style house; the Willing Workers Hall in Warren, a social hall built in 1815; and Westmoreland’s Federal-style Brick Church, built in 1838. Jersey City: The mayor is denying he engaged in prohibited campaigning during voting on hotly contested measures restricting Airbnb and other short-term rental companies. A short video posted online Tuesday shows Mayor Steven Fulop speaking to someone inside a polling place near a voting booth. The conversation isn’t entirely intelligible, but Fulop can be heard saying, ‘So vote ‘yes.’ ” At a news conference Wednesday, Fulop said he was thanking poll workers and didn’t approach anyone or hand out literature. State law bans soliciting support or distributing literature within 100 feet of a polling place. A spokesman for Keep Our Homes, an organization opposed to the measures, said in an email that Fulop’s actions showed “a shocking disregard for the law.” Albuquerque: Presbyterian Healthcare Services and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas. The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns. The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas. Officials say the program also will focus on mental health. Presbyterian Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio. The first group of nurses and midwives will be selected in the first half of 2020. Albany: President Donald Trump isn’t a fan of the state’s new bail reform law, which will curtail the number of people jailed while awaiting trial. The president tweeted Tuesday that New York’s Democratic governor and mayor “are letting out 900 Criminals, some hardened & bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining” city. That was a reference to estimates from New York City’s corrections officials on the number of prisoners who might be eligible for release under the new law. Gov. Andrew Cuomo punched back, saying Trump gave up his right to call New York home when he recently claimed Florida residency. The state’s law was passed to address complaints that poor people accused of minor crimes were often jailed for long periods because they couldn’t afford to post bail. Knightdale: An assistant high school football coach has resigned after making racist comments on Instagram. News outlets report John Hoskins resigned over the weekend from his post at Knightdale High School. WTVD-TV reports Hoskins, who is white, posted a now-deleted video to Instagram in which he said “white power” and the n-word. Hoskins told the station Tuesday that “just to set the record, I’m not a racist.” He says his black friends have given him the OK to use the word, as have players on the majority-black team that he coached. He says he posted the video and used the slur while caught up in celebrating the team’s win against Corinth Holders High last week. The video was shared with administrators before Hoskins deleted it. Bismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum is urging U.S. Customs and Border Protection not to cut hours of operation at three entry ports on the North Dakota-Canadian border. Border Protection has proposed moving back the closing time at the Maida and Carbury crossings from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the Antler crossing from 10 p.m. to 5 p.m. In a letter to the CBP, Burgum noted all three ports experienced an increase in automobile and truck crossings in fiscal year 2018. Burgum says he’s concerned reducing the hours of operation will have a negative impact on tourism, movement of goods and local economies. The agency says that it wants to use its resources at the busiest locations and that there are low numbers of crossings during the times it plans to cut. Columbus: Voters have approved nearly three-quarters of the public school district tax issues that were on ballots across the state for Tuesday’s election. The Ohio School Boards Association says unofficial results show voters passed 113 of the 154 school tax issues on the ballot, or 73%. The association says just over half of the proposals were renewals, and all but a few of those 82 renewal measures were approved. There was less support for new school tax issues, as only 35 of those 72 issues were passed. The votes come as state lawmakers are considering a possible overhaul of how Ohio schools are funded with a mix of state and local dollars. Ohio’s school-funding system has become a complicated patchwork since the system was found unconstitutional in 1997. Oklahoma City: The state Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The high court acted Monday after an abortion clinic appealed a lower court judge’s decision to uphold a ban on a second-trimester abortion procedure. The Tulsa Women’s Reproductive Clinic requested the temporary injunction to put the law on hold, telling justices the law would be detrimental for women. The 2015 law would restrict the use of instruments in dilation and evacuation abortions after 14 weeks of pregnancy, except when needed to save the woman’s life or prevent a serious risk to her health. It had been on hold while the legal challenge was pending. State numbers show nearly 7% of about 5,000 abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2018 were performed using this method. Eugene: A year ago a California group rejected more than 2,000 tons of wine grapes grown in Southern Oregon for supposed smoke taint from wildfire impact in the region, representing a $4 million dollar collective loss for more than 15 grape growers in the Rogue Valley. This year, a collective of Willamette Valley winemakers is being recognized with a national award for what they did next. The wineries quickly made arrangements to bring some of the fruit north. Based on lab results from each lot, they believed the grapes had been rejected without cause. They labeled their collaborative wines Oregon Solidarity Wines and pledged proceeds from their sale back to the grape growers. Wine Enthusiast Magazine has awarded Oregon Solidarity with a 2019 Wine Star Award for Innovator of the Year. Philadelphia: Democrats completed an electoral sweep of the metro area’s four suburban counties, long a bastion of Republican control and a crucial bellwether for statewide candidates. Democrats won control in Delaware and Chester counties in Tuesday’s election for the first time going back to the Civil War and won control in Bucks County for the first time since the 1980s. Democrats took control of Montgomery County several years ago. The fast-growing counties now account for more than 1 in 5 of all registered voters, and they tend to vote in higher proportions than the rest of the state. The Democratic victories in Delaware and Chester counties were particularly strong, winning every countywide race. For three decades, the counties had been growing increasingly liberal, but the trend seems to have accelerated since Donald Trump’s election as president. Providence: An analysis of the city’s electronic bike and scooter share shows users took nearly 170,000 scooter rides and more than 280,000 bike rides in the first year of the programs. The city report also contains information on average trips and areas where the devices were most popular. City councilmember Jo-Ann Ryan requested the analysis about three months ago and tells the Providence Journal the six-page report downplays public safety concerns and is missing information on routes, accident data and public input. Ryan says a comprehensive report is needed to inform future policies and prevent some of the issues that have cropped up. Providence announced in August that it was temporarily pulling the electronic bikes operated by the company JUMP over concerns of their misuse. Greenville: After two decades of decline, the state’s infant mortality rate has inched up, largely due to an increase in birth defects and premature births, state health officials said Wednesday. The state’s infant mortality rate declined 30% since 1999 but increased from 6.5 deaths to 7.2 per 1,000 births between 2017 to 2018, a 10.8% increase, said Kimberly Seals, director of the Department of Health and Environmental Control’s Bureau of Maternal and Child Health. During that time, infant deaths related to birth defects increased from 64 to 82, or 28%, she said. And the number of deaths related to prematurity or low birthweight increased from 52 to 58, or 11%, she said. In addition, Seals said, the infant mortality rate was 2.2 times higher among minorities. Sioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem has reiterated her opposition to legalizing industrial hemp production, even in the face of new federal rules allowing the cash crop. Hemp is seen as a possible boon by many farmers, but Noem said in a statement Tuesday that legalizing it would hamper enforcement of marijuana laws. But the governor also says South Dakota will allow the crop to be transported across the state. Last month, police arrested a Colorado man for carrying large bags of what he claims was hemp in his SUV. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new regulatory framework for hemp production last week, saying it will provide new economic opportunities for farmers and pave the way for new products and markets. Nashville: To help alleviate issues with driver’s license facilities, the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security is looking to hire 80 employees, expand hours of operation, consider outsourcing some operations and implement recommendations from a more than decade-old study. That’s what the agency’s top official, Commissioner Jeff Long, told Gov. Bill Lee and his administration Wednesday while outlining the department’s budgetary needs for the upcoming fiscal year. Although it oversees the Tennessee Highway Patrol, homeland security and the safety of residents in the Volunteer State, the agency has received a considerable amount of attention for continued issues regarding the issuance of driver’s licenses. With 44 official driver’s license facilities throughout the state, the agency has faced frustration over long wait times and technology crashes. Killeen: Family members of the 13 people killed in a mass shooting at the Fort Hood military base have marked the 10th anniversary of the attack. A ceremony was held Tuesday at Fort Hood in Killeen to remember the victims of the Nov. 5, 2009, attack. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 others injured when then-U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire at the base. Hasan was sentenced to death for the killings. But the Killeen Daily Herald reports many of the victims’ families expressed frustration that no execution date has been set for Hasan, who is among four soldiers on military death row. Salt Lake City: The University of Utah says a new mental health institute funded by a $150 million donation from the influential Huntsman family will focus on researching the genetic causes of mental illnesses and provide more treatment to college students and rural residents. The university said in a news release Monday that the Huntsman Mental Health Institute will aim to provided research-based treatment. The donation will also help fund the University of Utah Health’s psychiatry department. The Huntsmans already have a major cancer research center in Utah that bears the family name. The late Jon Huntsman Sr. was the founder of a company that refines raw materials that go into thousands of products. One of his sons, Peter Huntsman, says he hopes the institute help change the stigma and misperceptions about mental health. St. Johnsbury: A church will begin hosting a morning “warming center” for the winter season. The United Community Church in St. Johnsbury announced its “warming center” will be open seven days a week beginning Nov. 15, the same day the overnight warming shelter opens. The church’s effort to house an overnight shelter was met with opposition from St. Johnsbury Select Board members in 2015. The board had added language to the town’s bylaws forbidding shelters outside the health services zone. The Caledonian Record reports the decision to host the warming program follows a five-month pilot program last year. The community organizers say the morning center is open to anyone in the community. The center will operate from 7:30 a.m. to noon Monday through Sunday. Newport News: A Democratic candidate who lost a random drawing that determined control of the state House of Delegates nearly two years ago easily won a rematch against her Republican opponent. Shelly Simonds defeated four-term Del. David Yancey handily Tuesday in a race for the 94th District in Newport News. The close 2017 race between the two went to a recount, then to court. Eventually, officials used the luck of the draw, placing the name of each candidate on a piece of paper and each piece of paper in a separate film canister. The canisters were put into a cobalt blue-and-white ceramic bowl made by a local artist and stirred around. The canister containing Yancey’s name was drawn, giving him the win. On Tuesday, Simonds won nearly 58% of the vote. Yancey won about 40%. Kennewick: The City Council has repealed its decade-old rules governing dangerous dogs after a new state law weakened breed-specific regulations. The Tri-City Herald reports the Legislature passed a state law requiring cities with breed-specific legislation to exempt dogs that can be certified as good canine citizens by the American Kennel Club or other organizations. Kennewick City Council voted Tuesday to get rid of its former regulations instead of adopting rules exempting well-mannered dogs. Officials say Kennewick first adopted breed-specific regulations after increased reports about injuries inflicted by dangerous dogs like pit bulls. Advocates and pit bull owners say regulations included having special licenses and muzzling dogs in public. Officials say the rules do not exempt owners from liability if their pets attack. Charleston: West Virginia American Water has awarded grants to provide bottle-filling stations to 10 groups throughout the utility’s service area. The company says in a statement that the program is aimed at reducing plastic waste from single-use bottles and providing filling stations to nonprofit groups, schools and local government facilities. Among the groups that were selected from more than 90 applications are the AD Lewis Community Center in Huntington and Salt Rock Elementary School in Cabell County; the Fayette County Public Library in Oak Hill; the Putnam County Public Library in Hurricane; and Lewis County High School and the Lewis County Park in Weston. Other groups involved include Mercer Elementary School in Princeton and CAMC Women and Children’s Hospital, the West Virginia Capitol Complex and Flinn Elementary School, all in Charleston. Madison: State legislators struggled Wednesday with a bill that would force schools to teach cursive writing, questioning whether they should make teachers spend time and money preserving the centuries-old style in today’s computerized world. Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt, a former teacher, introduced the bill in September that would require schools receiving state dollars to include cursive in their elementary curriculum, with the goal of having students write legibly in cursive by the end of fifth grade. Thiesfeldt’s bill wouldn’t come cheap, at least according to state education officials, but he tried to make a case for the measure during a public hearing in front of the Assembly’s state affairs committee Wednesday afternoon. He said studies have shown writing in cursive fosters neurological connections in students’ brains, improves retention and can help dyslexic children read because cursive letters are more distinctive than printed letters. Casper: The Wyoming Association of Broadcasters says it will push state lawmakers to pass a media shield law. Wyoming is the only state in the nation without legal protections for journalists who refuse to provide the names of confidential sources to law enforcement officers. Such laws can encourage whistleblowers to report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. Wyoming Association of Broadcasters lobbyist Laura Grott says the state lacks a shield law not because of opposition but because of a lack of effort by Wyoming media. The broadcast journalist group unveiled the proposal at a recent meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the Wyoming Press Association has largely resisted a media shield law. The newspaper organization argues existing First Amendment protections are enough for the press and their sources.

(Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz, Pasadena Star-News/SCNG)  Mourners who visited Kathy and Ken Dunham’s Newbury Park home in the aftermath of their son’s death last year often wondered why there were no family photographs adorning the walls. Just hours after learning that their 21-year-old son, Jake, had been among the 12 people killed in the Nov. 7, 2018, attack at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, his family was forced to evacuate, fleeing the destructive Woolsey fire that raced through the Conejo Valley. So the Dunhams piled their possessions, including family photos, into their car as they fled —  but found themselves too emotionally drained to unpack when they returned. Their home was spared from the fire, but its walls were left bare for weeks after the shooting. RELATED: Here are the stories of all 12 Thousand Oaks mass shooting victims “It was hard because we didn’t have anything to look at,” Ken Dunham, 55, said. “We had a news photo of the tragic event, and that’s it.” Afterward, as he and his wife went over keepsakes Jake had left behind, the couple decided they would never find themselves without a memento of him again. They hired a tattoo artist in May, and had two of the last messages their son would ever write to them inscribed onto their skin. The letters inked permanently onto Kathy Dunham’s inner forearm are written in Jake’s handwriting, transcribed from a Mother’s Day note he had sent not long before he died. A similar tattoo, worn in a matching location, by Ken Dunham quotes the last birthday card his son had ever given him. When he glances at it, he is transported back to a cherished day spent celebrating with Jake, who had a preference for heavy India pale ales. It’s a memory even more precious now in his absence. “He had just turned 21, so we were able to go out together. I got off of work early, so he picked me up,” Ken Dunham said. “We went and had some beers at some of the brewhouses and just had a good afternoon. That’s what this card represents, is that day.” It has been a difficult year for their family, Kathy Dunham, 51, said. Emotions have run high in their household as she, Ken, and their daughter, Alexis, 24, have struggled to cope with Jake’s death. But the mother has found some solace whenever she looks down and reads the words “I love you!,” written in her son’s distinct style, just above her wrist. The couple’s prominently worn ink has also opened up opportunities to share their experiences with others. They view conversations sparked by their tattoos as chances to keep their memories of Jake, a risk-taker who lived his life at full throttle by the slogan ‘hold’er wide,’ alive in the community. “People don’t really know what it’s about until they see it and start asking,” Kathy Dunham said. “Otherwise, people are afraid to approach you and bring up the subject. To me, I’d rather they bring up the subject to know that you remembered my son, that my son is in your thoughts, is not forgotten.” The note on Kathy Dunham’s arm is her only tattoo. It did hurt a bit, but only took about 45 minutes to complete. Besides, the oncology nurse said she has a high tolerance for pain. “A Good Hurt” Modern tattoo machines use an electric motor to rapidly jab ink-coated needles in and out of a person’s skin. Larger pieces can take dozens of hours to complete, often broken up over several days into long sessions. The sustained, stinging, burning sensation that comes with getting a tattoo has a calming, stress-relieving effect on Kaelyn Carter, 21, of Port Hueneme. The former Thousand Oaks resident calls the feeling “a good hurt,” and had her first piece done on her shoulder at the age of 18 to commemorate the death of her grandfather. Carter’s tattoo artist completed her ninth and most recent piece, a tribute on her forearm to her friend Cody Coffman, about a month after he was killed at Borderline.  A post shared by Julio Rodriguez Arts (@juliorodriguezarts)  For her, remembering the lives lost at Borderline means honoring her friend’s sacrifice. As smoke filled the building and gunfire rang out across the dance floor, Coffman shielded his friends while they hid under a table, witnesses said during his funeral. Many managed to escape, but the 22-year-old was struck in the head by a bullet and died that night. Carter remembers him as a goofball and a hero. She recently moved from Thousand Oaks to Port Hueneme, with plans to carry Coffman’s memory far and wide as she starts a new family and travels with her husband, Brandon, a member of the U.S. Navy. Last November’s tragedy rippled across the Conejo Valley, impacting people like Sean Lindsay, 37, of Simi Valley, who had never met any of the victims. The electrician grew up in Thousand Oaks, used to frequent Borderline and had been trained as a chaplain. After he learned about the shooting, he traveled to a growing impromptu memorial site at the bar’s parking lot to offer counseling. “Some people were angry. Some people were really sad. Some people were really confused,” Lindsay said. “I don’t have all the right words to say, but the people that wanted to talk, I was just trying to let them talk.” He would often start a conversation by offering a tissue to a weeping stranger. He heard numerous accounts of loved ones lost, and spent as much as 10 hours a day listening to people grieve in the period immediately after the shooting. Many of the stories Lindsay heard shook him. At times, he wanted to cry with those he spoke with, but held back. “I didn’t feel that that would help,” he said “So, I just checked my emotions, and just tried to listen as much as possible. “ But on at least one occasion the weight of what he had been told became too much for him. “I was in the shower after work. All of a sudden, all of the sights, all of the sounds, all of the stories, they all came up at once,” he said. “And the next thing I know, I’m sitting in the corner of my shower crying.” It was then that Lindsay decided he needed to channel all of the feelings building up inside of him. He turned to the same artist Carter had commissioned, and had a tribute piece tattooed onto his shoulder. The process helped him move forward from the tragedy, while allowing the spirit of the 12 people killed last year to live on in his memory. Both Carter and Lindsay intend to get even more ink in memory of what took place at Borderline. The Dunhams also plan on expanding their tribute pieces to their son. Kathy has been considering a piece honoring her relationship with her daughter for years, and also wants a tattoo of Jake’s truck, a prized possession of the off-roading aficionado, inscribed onto her shoulder. Ken Dunham said he is currently working on a design, and will take his time searching for an artist able to capture his son’s likeness for a portrait on his upper left arm. “When I’m flying across the desert on my dirt bike, I’ll know he’s right there with me,” he said.

101,https://www.ibtimes.com/pompeo-retraces-army-service-past-little-berlin-2861682?utm_source=Public&utm_medium=Feed&utm_campaign=Distribution,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo retraced his steps Thursday in the eastern German village of Moedlareuth, once a divided ""Little Berlin"" where he served as a young army officer. America's top diplomat is on a two-day tour of Germany ahead of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He is to meet with demonstrators from the 1989 peaceful revolution that brought the communist regime down, and give a speech in the German capital. On the ground in Moedlareuth, Pompeo was greeted by Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, with whom he visited the remains of a 3.3-metre (11 feet) tall concrete wall that had slashed a 700-metre scar through the town from 1966 to 1989. From 1986, Pompeo was one of 300,000 US soldiers stationed in Europe at the height of the Cold War, compared with around 30,000 today. The young US Army lieutenant stood opposite watchtowers and barbed wire that had blocked entry into the communist German Democratic Republic (GDR).

This is reality now for scandal-struck Airbnb, which must restore investor and public trust—which, along with outsourcing liabilities like “risk” and “owning property,” is the very basis of its business model—ahead of an IPO sometime in 2020.

Exactly how Airbnb, possibly worth as much as $35 billion, plans to go public, the San Francisco-based faux-hotelier hasn’t decided yet. But far more troubling for CEO Brian Chesky’s company than significant financial losses was the company’s nightmare Halloween. On October 31, reporter Allie Conti revealed in a viral article for Vice that Airbnb users are vulnerable to exploitation via a widespread (and apparently well-known) host scam, with little opportunity for recourse from the company.
That same night, five people were shot and killed at a “party house” in Orinda, California, just outside San Francisco, that been rented via Airbnb and was a known problem. Authorities had received noise complaints about the house in the months leading up to the mass shooting, including complaints about a party.
Both the host and the person who rented the home were kicked off the platform. Over the weekend, Airbnb announced it would eliminate ambiguously defined “party houses” from its listings, ramp up manual screenings of “high-risk reservations,” and deploy a “rapid-response team” to take “immediate action” against guests violating the new policies.
Realizing this wasn’t quite enough, on Wednesday, Chesky announced a few more safety features. By late December, Airbnb will “verify 100%” of its listings—something, you could argue, the company should already be doing—thus ensuring that guests don’t show up in the middle of the night in a strange city to a dangerous flophouse when they were expecting a secure villa.
But if they do, they’ll have a “neighbor hotline” staffed by real people to call and complain to, as well as a “guest guarantee” of a refund or a “rebooking” into another Airbnb-listed property “that is just as nice,” Chesky wrote in a series of Twitter posts, the clear aim of which—based on the number of times he used the word—is to restore “trust” in Airbnb’s platform.


We are introducing the Airbnb Guest Guarantee. Starting on 12/15/19, if a guest checks into a listing and it doesn’t meet our accuracy standards, we will rebook them into a listing that is just as nice — and if we can’t, they will get 100% of their money back.

“Airbnb is in the business of trust,” he posted. “We are making the most significant steps in designing trust on our platform since our original design in 2008.”
And: “We are a platform built on a foundation of trust. We need to continue innovating on trust to make it harder for the bad actors. The trust of our community is our top priority.”
Airbnb’s very bad week and Chesky’s corrections are stark reminders of the very amazing thing about Airbnb, which is that anyone uses it at all. So far, Airbnb has been successful in relying on a “trust” economy, which is to say it has been operating in a way different from almost every other business in America—certainly differently from its competitors in the hospitality industry.
Most businesses doesn’t operate on trust—they operate based on guarantees. Parties in a contract trust each side will fulfill its obligations; if they don’t, they are guaranteed some redress via the legal process. Your landlord trusts you will pay your rent on time, but if you don’t, he or she doesn’t need to trust that you will vacate your unit. You trust that the Hilton or the Marriott will be there and will have a room ready for you when you book it. But if it doesn’t, the company will suffer consequences.
So far, Airbnb has been successful in relying on the “trust economy” mostly thanks to the numbers game. Airbnb has something like seven million listings in almost every country in the world, and 150 million global users. Most users, like most people, are not scammers, and so what problems arose prior to October 31 weren’t bad enough to sink the company. But a reckoning was probably inevitable. Airbnb has been “lax” and erratic in enforcing its own rules, relying so far on hosts and guests to resolve differences between themselves. If they don’t, they will get a bad review and won’t be able to make money by renting their properties or save money by avoiding hotels.
Whatever the cause or the outcome, it was, at least most of the time and at least legally speaking, not Airbnb’s problem. That’s no longer the case.
Trust may yet prove to be less important than being cheap and abundant—that’s a determination Airbnb hosts and guests are making. But if Airbnb is going to successfully transition from Silicon Valley unicorn to viable long-term company, it may have to offer something more to its investors than a promise.


This is what the scammers said lol

We are introducing the Airbnb Guest Guarantee. Starting on 12/15/19, if a guest checks into a listing and it doesn’t meet our accuracy standards, we will rebook them into a listing that is just as nice — and if we can’t, they will get 100% of their money back.

“Airbnb is in the business of trust,” he posted. “We are making the most significant steps in designing trust on our platform since our original design in 2008.”
And: “We are a platform built on a foundation of trust. We need to continue innovating on trust to make it harder for the bad actors. The trust of our community is our top priority.”
Airbnb’s very bad week and Chesky’s corrections are stark reminders of the very amazing thing about Airbnb, which is that anyone uses it at all. So far, Airbnb has been successful in relying on a “trust” economy, which is to say it has been operating in a way different from almost every other business in America—certainly differently from its competitors in the hospitality industry.
Most businesses doesn’t operate on trust—they operate based on guarantees. Parties in a contract trust each side will fulfill its obligations; if they don’t, they are guaranteed some redress via the legal process. Your landlord trusts you will pay your rent on time, but if you don’t, he or she doesn’t need to trust that you will vacate your unit. You trust that the Hilton or the Marriott will be there and will have a room ready for you when you book it. But if it doesn’t, the company will suffer consequences.
So far, Airbnb has been successful in relying on the “trust economy” mostly thanks to the numbers game. Airbnb has something like seven million listings in almost every country in the world, and 150 million global users. Most users, like most people, are not scammers, and so what problems arose prior to October 31 weren’t bad enough to sink the company. But a reckoning was probably inevitable. Airbnb has been “lax” and erratic in enforcing its own rules, relying so far on hosts and guests to resolve differences between themselves. If they don’t, they will get a bad review and won’t be able to make money by renting their properties or save money by avoiding hotels.
Whatever the cause or the outcome, it was, at least most of the time and at least legally speaking, not Airbnb’s problem. That’s no longer the case.
Trust may yet prove to be less important than being cheap and abundant—that’s a determination Airbnb hosts and guests are making. But if Airbnb is going to successfully transition from Silicon Valley unicorn to viable long-term company, it may have to offer something more to its investors than a promise.

[+] victims at a makeshift memorial in Orinda, California. (Ray Chavez/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) Last week, VICE published a piece entitled, “I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb,” which exposed an ugly problem happening at the home-sharing business. It’s alleged that scammers are cheating and taking advantage of the short-term renters. These unscrupulous people create fake, too-good-to-be-true Airbnb profiles and post inaccurate and misleading listings under false names. It's the old bait-and-switch trick. At the very last minute, the so-called owner contacts the renter and tells them the the place they initially booked is having some issues, but they happen to have another great location as an alternative. The other place turns out to be not as nice—dreadful even—and possibly dangerous. The unpleasant experience is magnified by reports contending that Airbnb is unhelpful in its customers’ pursuit of assistance or refunds. The home-sharing site has dramatically grown worldwide. Airbnb is valued at $31 billion—an amount higher than the well-established Hilton Hotel chain. Along with this massive growth has come some controversies and problems. Recently, an Airbnb home in Orinda, California, was used as a “party house” on Halloween. Things turned tragic, as a mass shooting ensued. Airbnb reportedly also has a hidden-camera problem. There have been numerous claims made by renters of finding hidden cameras in the homes and apartments at which they’ve stayed. Airbnb is locked in a number of battles with local municipalities across the country. These disputes involve allegations made by a number of city officials regarding taxes, noncompliance with certain zoning and safety rules and failing to remove illegal listings. Ulrik Binzer, CEO of Host Compliance, which helps cities with rules for short-term rentals, says that Airbnb is locked in “a city-by-city, block-by-block guerrilla war” against local governments. These and other problems have pushed the company to make a monumental move to review and verify all 7 million of its listings. CEO Brian Chesky said, “We’re going to make sure that we can stand behind every single listing, every single host.” The chief executive called the program the “most significant” change undertaken by Airbnb. The plan calls for the company to undertake a yearlong project to ensure that all of the homes listed are accurately advertised. “Starting now, verification of all 7 million listings on Airbnb will commence,” Chesky asserted. “We believe that trust on the internet begins with verifying the accuracy of the information on internet platforms, and we believe that this is an important step for our industry."" Interestingly, verification doesn’t necessarily mean that Airbnb will send inspectors to every single home and apartment listed on the site. The verification, according to the company, will be done through a mixture of company and community monitoring. This seems woefully inadequate. How can you tell the real condition of a home if no one actually goes inside and checks? Verifying 7 million rentals is a colossal feat. Statistically, there has to be some big problems lurking around and if nobody is tasked to actually step inside, new issues will surface down the road. “More than 11 years after Joe, Nate and I started Airbnb, I have been asked what has surprised me most about the world. My answer is two things: that people are, in fact, fundamentally good, and that we are 99% the same,” Chesky said. “We still believe this, and with these changes, we hope to continue to demonstrate this to the world."" This is a nice, lofty statement; however, maybe instead of relying upon blind trust, Airbnb should have invested in checking and investing to ensure the safety and quality of the homes listed on its site. Rather than depending on “faith,” examiners should be dispatched to each and every listing to ensure the safety of its customers. Fairly recently, a large number of CEOs have been forced to step down due to pressure from the public, media, board of directors and investors. High-profile CEOs of companies such as WeWork, Uber, Nike, Under Armour, Nissan, Boeing’s commercial division and McDonald’s have all been relieved of their responsibilities. They have all been held responsible for things that have occured or actions they’ve taken at their respective companies, which were held up to scrutiny and later decided it was best for a change. In light of this trend, it is surprising that the CEO of Airbnb didn’t take actions sooner. While it’s nice that Chesky is initiating changes in response to these serious problems, there are questions as to why he is not going further. It seems reasonable to require the company to hire the people needed to physically inspect and review each and every listing that is offered on the site. Without an independent army of auditors and examiners inspecting the places, how can Chesky and the company’s customers ever feel fully safe? Airbnb plans to go public next year with an initial public offering (IPO). If the company were to invest in a full-scale audit of all 7 million properties listed on the site, the costs will be very substantial. It could be possible that the company would rather not engage in a traditional on-site review to save money, in an effort to make the company’s financial picture look stronger when seeking investors for its upcoming IPO. If this is the case, it’s a sad commentary of another corporation putting profits before the safety of its customers.

106,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/07/east-bay-city-considers-airbnb-short-term-rental-policy-after-mass-shooting/,"Trending: LIVERMORE — Even before the mass shooting last week in Orinda that left five dead during a party at a rented Airbnb home, Livermore already was considering creating a policy on its short-term rentals. Now, the process seems to be headed for the fast lane. Just three days before the Halloween night shooting in Orinda, a handful of neighbors from the newly formed “Livermore Citizens for the Regulation of Short-Term Rentals” spoke at the City Council meeting, asking for regulation of short-term rentals. They pointed out that in the absence of a citywide ordinance, residents can rent out their homes as short-term rentals. Livermore, they said, is the only city left in the area without any sort of regulation. The neighbors, in particular, complained about one neighbor who turned his home into a weekend short-term rental on websites such as Airbnb or VRBO. “The renters are left unsupervised, leaving to us neighbors to deal with or tolerate noisy parties, drunkenness, drug use, and in one case, the filming of a music video,” said one man at the Oct. 28 council meeting. “We have met with our neighbors, and suggested measures to make the situation more tolerable. And we were told, there was no law against his business and he would proceed as he sees fit,” he said. Neighbors described a bachelorette party one weekend with a woman drunk in the middle of the night on their cul-de-sac. Several months ago, a production company showed up to film a music video of rising rap artist “Gunna,” who has been featured in music with Travis Scott, Young Thug and Gucci Mane, among others. Residents asked for the city to consider a minimum 30-day rental, to avoid short-term weekend rentals. The group is also asking for the city to consider having the owner on the property during the rentals, such as in a guest house, in order to monitor the renters. City Manager Marc Roberts told the council at the end of the meeting that the city was already considering some regulation on the short-term rentals, and a proposal would come before the council next year. “Staff is taking a look at that both from a regulatory side and as well the financial side,” Roberts told council at the meeting. But after the Orinda shooting, Councilman Bob Woerner said he’s hoping something will be on council’s agenda much sooner, even as early as the end of this month. Mayor John Marchand said that he would be willing for the council to discuss short-term rentals earlier as well. “I think we do a very good job of being aware of things that are happening,” Marchand said. In the meantime, residents can file complaints if there are noise problems, the mayor said. If drug activity is reported, the city can go after the property owner, he said. In Orinda, city regulations already in place called for no more than 13 people in a short-rental at one time. But one of the problems was that no one followed the rules, Marchand said. The Orinda party had more than 100 people, according to authorities. Matt Alexander, the owner of the Livermore home who neighbors complained about, told this newspaper that he’s met with his neighbors and made changes to his rental policy. For example, parties are strictly prohibited, all who rent the home must tell him the names of people that are staying, and he has a phone conversation to vet guests before agreeing to rent them the home. “It is legal, what I’m doing. But of course, I want to be a respectful neighbor. I ask guests to try to be polite and to keep the noise down,” Alexander said. Alexander is married with four children and said that renting out their home for short-term rentals has been a way for his family to make ends meet. “I get why they’re are cons to (short-term rentals). But for me and my family, it’s been a blessing,” he said. He said there’s a need for short-term rentals in Livermore: There aren’t enough hotels, and the Livermore wine region attracts people from around the state. Renting out an entire house is also a way for families to stay together, instead of being split into different hotel rooms, Alexander said. One of their frequent renters is a pastor at a nearby church, and he also gets visitors on business for the Livermore Livermore lab, he said. Alexander said before he listed his home online for these short-term rentals, he asked the city if it was allowed and he also got a business license. His home is not the only one listed in Livermore; a search of short-term rental homes in the Livermore area turned up at least 300 results. In light of the Orinda shooting, Airbnb announced on Wednesday that it will verify all 7 million rental listings, including the details of all of its listings, the accuracy of rental house photos, addresses, among other details. The nearby cities of Pleasanton and Dublin do have some rules about short-term rentals. In Pleasanton, short-term rentals are prohibited. Owners can, however, rent out their homes for 30 days or longer, or get a conditional use permit to operate a bed-and-breakfast, according to the city’s municipal code. The B&B operations would mean that an owner is staying in the home and rents out a room. Similarly, in Dublin, although there is no specific ordinance on short-term rentals, city zoning laws require that those who want to open up their homes are required to obtain  conditional use permits for bed and breakfasts. As in Pleasanton, this means that an entire home cannot be rented out for a short-term rental.

107,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/MsNoSp_VvSk/,"CNN’s partisan crusade to impeach President Trump appears to be costing the far-left outlet viewers, compared to October of last year. MSNBC and Fox News have remained fairly steady in the ratings, which shows Americans are just not that into this whole impeachment hoax. The media’s fanatical crusade to remove President Trump from office is, of course, mostly based on ideological grounds. The corporate media are run by far-left activists who hate Trump, have still not come to terms with his 2016 victory, and were certain their Russia Collusion Hoax would be the end of him. But another reason the media are so closely colluding with Democrats to overturn the 2016 election, and this especially includes CNN and MSNBC, is ratings. In the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller debunking their three-year Russia Collusion Hoax, CNN and MSNBC are suffering through humiliating ratings and are desperate for something, anything, to boost viewership numbers. And for a bit, this ridiculous impeachment effort did work as a short-term sugar high. But now that it has become obvious Democrats don’t have the goods to impeach, not only have CNN and MSNBC’s ratings settled back down, in some areas, their ratings are lower than they were last year when they were not screaming about impeachment 24/7. To ensure there was no accidental cherry-picking on my part, I’m deliberately comparing last week’s cable news ratings to the entire month of October 2018, just in case there was a hurricane or mass-shooting during that same week last October. October  2018 (total primetime viewers FOX: 2.829 million MSNBC: 1.575 million CNNLOL: 931,000 Week of October 28 (total primetime viewers) FOX: 2.672 million MSNBC: 1.8 million CNNLOL: 884,000  October 2018 (total day viewers) FOX: 1.685 million MSNBC: 909,000 CNNLOL: 690,000 Week of October 28 (total day viewers) FOX: 1.518 million MSNBC: 1.074 million CNNLOL: 665,000 So as you can see, MSNBC ‘s primetime and total day viewership are a little higher but negligible. CNNLOL’s primetime viewership and total day, however, is actually lower, while Fox News pretty much stayed the same. How is this possible the same week the U.S. House of Representatives voted to formalize impeachment hearings? Well, this kind of confirms what I have suspected for a while, but since my evidence was anecdotal, I mostly kept it to myself. Over the years, I’ve stayed in regular touch with my own little focus group, a half-dozen people who do not know they are part of my focus group but are people I qualify as swing voters. Most reluctantly voted for Trump in 2016. A couple didn’t but considered it. What I find most informative, though, is how they run hot and cold on Trump. Sometimes, they like him. Other times, they can’t stand all the unnecessary drama he creates. For example, they all hated him telling the Squad to go back to their own countries, but they love the contempt he heaps on the media. Four of them have said they might support Joe Biden if he wins the nomination; the other two say they definitely will. None of them, not a single one, is talking about impeachment. In fact, no one — whether I know them or not — no one in any restaurant, in any checkout line, in any waiting room, in any place or anywhere, have I heard or overheard discuss impeachment. It is just not on the minds of everyday Americans. And now, we have these cable news ratings that back up the fact that the overall public is almost entirely indifferent to this… While the media bubble screams 24/7 about how historic! and consequential! it all is, how the walls are really fer real closing in on Drumpf  this time, all the American people are seeing is 1) a fake news rerun with your serial-lying host Adam Schiff and 2) a desperate and shrill attempt by the media to turn a molehill into a mountain, a banana into an uzi, a party popper into fat man and little boy. We’ve seen the transcript! We’ve seen the transcript of the Ukraine call! Which means you can parade around all the Never Trumpers you want, even parade them around in military uniform, but WE’VE SEEN THE TRANSCRIPT! Richard Nixon was caught on tape authorizing a hush-money payoff to the Watergate burglars. Bill Clinton was caught red-handed committing perjury. Those are smoking guns. All Trump did is what he is supposed to do: look out for the American taxpayer… I’m sorry, but the fact that Biden’s seeking to be president, does not inoculate him from having his corruption investigated — which means Trump was exactly right to ask Ukraine to look into how Biden and his son looted that country. There is just no there there, which is why people are not tuning in to cable news. Americans understand this is all kabuki, especially coming from a fake and always-hysterical media that have been pimping their credibility to bring about the end of the Bad Orange Man for four years. And Democrats, through their unforgivable secret hearings, and the violating of their previous promises not to pursue impeachment without bipartisan support, have turned impeachment — something that should be historic and consequential — into something meaningless, into just another weapon in the never-ending partisan food fight.

109,https://people.com/crime/thousand-oaks-bar-mass-shooting-victims-1-year-later/,"Twelve innocent people were lost to gun violence exactly one year ago Twelve innocent people were lost to gun violence exactly one year ago on Nov. 7, 2018, when a Marine Corps veteran entered a busy California bar and opened fire. Those slain in the mass shooting included a college freshman, a seasoned law enforcement officer, a recent college graduate and an aspiring Army recruit whom his father called his “best friend.” More than ten others were wounded in the attack, inside the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks during its weekly “College Country Night,” sheriff’s officials have said. Shots were first reported at about 11:20 p.m. The gunman was found dead in the bar of suicide. These are the deceased victims: “From what I understand,” Adler’s sister, Valarie Adler, told local TV station KNBC, “Sean tried to disarm [the gunman]. That is typical of Sean.” Valarie called Sean — a father of two an a salesman turned coffee shop owner who also worked at Borderline — “caring” and “compassionate.” “He was a protector, always sticking up for people. … I just don’t understand,” she said. “I don’t understand the world.” The Los Angeles Times and Orange County Registerreport that Adler was working at the bar (and another job as a bouncer) while his new business, Rivalry Roasters, got on its feet. Both of his sons are under the age of 18, according to the papers. The Register reports that they joined him for opening day at Rivalry, working behind the counter. “He gave his all, to whatever it was he did,” friend Mike Nolan told the Register. “He worked his butt off. He did everything he could to make this shop a reality.” According to his heartbroken father, Jason Coffman, Cody was a young man figuring out his own path in life. “He was in a limbo stage,” says Jason, 40, of his son. “He was going to have fun, doing his partying thing and getting it out of his system.” Jason tells PEOPLE Cody “wanted to go into the Army” and had been “talking to recruiters and getting ready to go.” Jason says he heard Cody, who had been working for a moving company, died shielding others when the gunman entered. “That’s my boy,” Cody’s dad says. “He’s a hero now — that’s how I view him: as a hero,” he says. Dingman’s mother, Lorrie Dingman, describes him to PEOPLE as “such a caring person” who “always, always, always had a smile on his face. He emitted joy and he was really happy.” “He gave the best hugs,” she adds. “He would always give me a kiss, he always told me he loved me.” Dingman’s younger brother, Aidan, shared his grief in an Instagram post after the shooting. “Words cannot describe the pain I am feeling. Last night my life was changed forever,” Aidan wrote. “I received news of gunfire at Borderline Bar & Grille from a friend. Which was where my brother was hanging out for the night,” Aidan continued in his post. “Me, my dad, and mom raced to the scene. Or as close as we could get. We tried for hours and hours to get in touch with Blake and got no response. “At 12:00 this morning I was informed that my amazing brother was taken down by the shooter as well as his good friend Jake Dunham. Blake, I love you so much and I miss you more than you can imagine.” Dunham’s father, Ken Dunham, had previously shared how he was unable to reach his son after the shooting — an unknowing echo of the same confusion suffered by Cody Coffman’s father. “I keep calling it but there’s no answer,” Ken reportedly said. “It just keeps ringing out. And he always answers his phone.” His mother Kathy tells PEOPLE her son, at a young age, was diagnosed with hemophilia, a rare disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly. Doctors encouraged him to swim rather than riding dirt bikes — but he preferred to ride. “He loved dirt biking, which he started at age 7 on training wheels,” his mother recalls. “He was jumping BMX bikes and everything else a child with hemophilia should not do.” His passion for BMX bikes turned into a love for racing off-road trucks. He was in the process of rebuilding an engine so that he could make his truck go faster, Kathy says. “Jake has always lived life to the fullest,” she says. “And full-throttle, wide-open — or as he put it, ‘Hold ‘er wide!’ ” One of the first responders at the scene Wednesday night, Helus was a 29-year veteran of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office who was getting ready to retire. He was on the phone with his wife when he received word of the shooting, authorities have said. Police are hailing him a “hero” for his selfless actions. Authorities said he was shot multiple times as he entered the bar and later died at the hospital. He leaves behind a wife and an adult son. “He went into save lives, to save other people,” Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told reporters. “He was totally committed, he gave his all, and tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero.” Housley, a freshman at Pepperdine University, was with friends at the bar when the gunman, dressed all in black, started firing. Housley is the niece of actress Tamera Mowry-Housley and her husband, Adam Housley. “Our hearts are broken. We just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night’s shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks,” the couple said in a statement to PEOPLE. “Alaina was an incredible young woman with so much life ahead of her and we are devastated that her life was cut short in this manner,” the statement adds. “We thank everyone for your prayers and ask for privacy at this time.” Manrique, like the shooter, was a Marine Corps veteran — but since his years of service Manrique had dedicated timing to helping others. “The best way I can describe him is as a ‘saint.’ He truly believed in service,” friend Tim O’Brien, with whom Manrique planned to open a veteran-oriented brewery, told the Orange County Register. “Dan was the guy you could rely on if you ran out of gas in the middle of the night. He would help you out if something bad happened. He was there, dedicated, loyal.” Colleagues at Team Red White & Blue, where Manrique was very active in helping veterans transition from the military to civilian life, mourned his death in a statement. “Dan’s life was dedicated to serving others, during his military career and beyond,” said Team RWB’s executive director, John Pinter. “We offer our deepest condolences to the Manrique family and ask that our Eagles around the world join us in keeping all those impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.” According to the group, Manrique worked as a radio operator in the Marines’ 2nd Combat Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine Division. He served in the Middle East in 2007 and joined Team RWB in 2012. Sara Bergeron, a friend and fellow veteran, told USA Todaythat Manrique “was so selfless and committed to helping veterans succeed and just thrive. He never quit on people. She said: “The shooter killed someone who could have been his lifeline, who could have helped him with his PTSD, who could have understood more than anyone what he was going through.” Meek, who graduated in May with a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice, was “one of the precious lives cut short in this tragedy,” according to a statement from his alma mater California Lutheran University. Meek “heroically saved lives” in the shooting, university officials said. “We will pray, begin to comfort one another in our grief, and hold the families, friends and loved ones of the victims in our hearts,” their statement concludes. “Cal Lutheran wraps its arms around the Meek family and other families, and around every member of this community of caring.” Richard Mgrdechian, who manages the band Madison Rising, says they met Meek at a 2014 concert: “He was a very nice guy. He played guitar and loved music.” Meza, who worked as a bus boy at the Borderline Bar & Grill, was an alumni of the Carpinteria Unified School District, according to a statement his former school district. “Mark was loved by many in our community and will be dearly missed,” the statement reads. “Please hold his family and friends in your hearts and thoughts at this difficult time. Morisette, a cashier at the Borderline Bar & Grill, was among the first to be gunned down during Wednesday’s mass violence. Morisette was a native of Simi Valley, California. She was waiting tables the night she died, friends confirm. One of them, Carl Edgar, a bar regular who survived the Las Vegas massacre last year, tells PEOPLE that Kristina “was sweet, caring, and always had a smile on her face.” Orfanos, a Navy veteran who went by “Tel,” had already survived one massacre only to die in another, his parents have said in interviews. They told the Washington Post, New York Times and others that Orfanos was at the Route 91 country music festival in Las Vegas last year, in a mass shooting there that killed 58 victims. “I don’t want prayers. I don’t want thoughts,” his mother, Susan Orfanos, reportedly said in a local TV interview. “I want gun control.” Susan was equally emphatic when speaking with the Times: “He was killed last night at Borderline. He made it through Las Vegas, he came home. And he didn’t come home last night, and the two words I want you to write are: Gun control. Right now — so that no one else goes through this. Can you do that? Can you do that for me? Gun control.” Carl Edgar, a Borderline regular, tells PEOPLE that Tel was working security at the bar. “[He] was an extremely good friend,” Edgar recalls, adding, “Always said ‘hi’ to me when I came in, always gave me a hug.” Kevin, a high school friend of Tel’s, echoed that, telling PEOPLE: “He was a great guy. Would never hurt a fly. Always had a sense of humor. Always joking around. You can walk into him in any of the local bars here and he would be sitting there hanging out with two or seven friends.” Sparks was “was the kind of girl that if you had friends, you’d want them to marry her,” her aunt Patricia Sparks told the Associated Press. A student at a local college, she reportedly turned 21 in August and the Borderline was a favorite spot — Wednesday night, before the shooting, she posted a photo of her dancing there. “We’re in shock,” Patricia said. Rev. Dr. Walter C. Dilg, senior pastor at the United Methodist Church in Westlake Village, where Sparks was raised, described her as well-liked and “deeply missed.” • With reporting by ELAINE ARADILLAS, KC BAKER, JOHNNY DODD, SUSAN KEATING, AILI NAHAS and CHRISTINE PELISEK ",2019-11-07 16:38:11,"Remembering the 12 Victims of the Thousand Oaks Bar Mass Shooting, 1 Year Later",,300472,http://www.people.com/people/

114,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/07/marin-city-man-killed-in-orinda-halloween-shooting-fondly-remembered/,"Trending: The Marin City community is mourning the death of Javlin County, a 29-year-old father who was among the five victims of the Orinda Halloween shooting. A GoFundMe page (gofundme.com/f/supporting-the-family-of-javlin-county) has been set up to support his family, raising more than $7,000 since it launched this past weekend. “We’re all very saddened to hear of this tragic event,” said the Rev. Rondall Leggett, pastor of the First Missionary Baptist Church in Marin City. “I know that our community is definitely mourning and grieving his departure.” County, a father of two, was a participant in a church program for young men, specifically young fathers, called the Marin City Fatherhood Council. The council, founded by Leggett, is a support group for young men to become strong male role models and to help guide their children toward academic success. Leggett described County as a hardworking man, who “was open, sincere and wanting to learn more and do better.” “Javlin was one that began to surface and rise as a leader in the group,” Leggett said. “Others looked up to him.” Donnell Jones, the program facilitator, agreed. Jones said members of the African-American community face several challenges, seeking equity in education, employment and opportunities in general. “He was doing all the right things,” Jones said. “He often spoke of his children, saying how they were his motivation to be better, advance, better his life.” Felecia Gaston, the founder and executive director of Performing Stars and the Phoenix Project, serving Marin City youth, said the community is reeling from the death of another young black man. “In this past year, our community has been impacted by so many unexpected tragic deaths of young black males: car accidents, drownings and gun violence,” she said, noting that all but one was a father. In June, Branson standout athlete Kwentyn Wiggins, 17, was killed in a car wreck. Days later, Tony Carnill Foster Jr., 34, was found dead at Stinson Beach. In September, Joshua Davis, a 28-year-old from Fairfield and a former Marin City resident was shot and killed in Richmond. Related Articles

117,https://people.com/human-interest/ruben-martinez-el-paso-challenge-overpowers-evil/,"""Everyone should be kind — not just in El Paso, but every part of the world,"" says Ruben Martinez At first, 11-year-old Ruben Martinez was frightened and overwhelmed watching the horrific mass shooting unfolding on his TV that left 22 people dead and 24 more wounded at his local El Paso Walmart. But it wasn’t long before the resilient sixth-grader came up with a plan to help him and his community heal. Ruben created the #ElPasoChallenge on Twitter, inviting people to commit to 22 random acts of kindness in honor of each victim who lost their life. “I usually did some things before like holding doors open, giving food to homeless people,” Ruben tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “I just thought kindness always overpowers evil.” Ruben and his mom, high school administrator Rose Gandarilla, 43, narrowly missed being at the store during the Aug. 3 mass shooting. The two had been at a fundraiser that morning and were stopping by Walmart to buy school supplies when they saw the chaotic scene and returned home. His initial reaction was to cocoon in his room, telling his mom he never wanted to go to a store again. To calm her son, Gandarilla told him to think of something to do to help. He emerged from his room 30 minutes later with a plan jotted down in his composition book. And he wanted to start immediately. PEOPLE’s first-ever Kindness Issue is dedicated to highlighting the ways, big and small, that kindness can make a difference and change lives. Click here and pick up the issue, on stands Friday, Nov. 8, for more stories on the impact of kindness from Julia Roberts, Tiffany Haddish and other stars, as well as everyday people practicing kindness in their communities. To share the story of someone who’s done something exceptionally kind, email kindnessawards@peoplemag.com. They went to Taco Bell to buy dinner for the first responders still at the scene. His next step was to get people at the restaurant to accept the challenge and do their own kind acts. “I went up to people and said, ‘Excuse me, I am starting the El Paso Challenge to honor the people who were killed. The man who did this was full of hate and that is not what El Paso is about. We are about kindness, so please do these acts of kindness. Do you accept?'” Ruben recalls. RELATED: 11-Year-Old Starts ‘El Paso Challenge’ to Encourage Acts of Kindness Honoring Victims The next day, Ruben and his mom went to two hospitals and brought flowers to the victims’ families in the waiting rooms and then to the first responders. “Since he was little, I would tell him when we would go get something to eat to go pick a table or a person, and we’ve always paid for their dinner,” Gandarilla says. “One time after we ate, he saw someone outside McDonald’s and he said, ‘They are hungry. You have to help them.'” RELATED VIDEO: Priyanka Chopra, Jessica Biel, Kerry Washington and More on the Kindest Thing Anyone Has Done for Them Ruben’s campaign snowballed, going worldwide while gathering notice from actress and El Paso native Cara Santana, who donated a generous gift card for Ruben to use, and Senators Ted Cruz and Kamala Harris. Cindy Aguilar, counselor at Lamar Elementary, has known Ruben for five years. “He’s a very kind person. He shared how distraught we were as a community and wanted to help,” she says, adding that Ruben has inspired students at his former elementary school as young as kindergarten to write down their daily acts, tallied to 22 — and beyond.

118,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/11/08/looks-like-will-beto-kick-around/,"Robert Francis O’Rourke isn’t going anywhere, you know. Thursday night during a phone call with supporters, he reassured them he “absolutely” plans to stay involved in politics. These are the first remarks he’s made since dropping his bid to be the Democrats’ 2020 presidential nominee. Surely this isn’t a surprise to anyone with even a small interest in the 2020 election cycle. O’Rourke has a Texas-sized ego and he’s just 47 years old so there is plenty of time for him to sit back and wait until an opening presents itself to him. It doesn’t look like he’ll be running for the Senate, though, as he is dashing the hopes of Democrats about entering that race. There is an abundance of candidates running against Senator John Cornyn and it looks like Beto plans to let them slug it out. In the meantime, Beto is telling supporters that he plans to support candidates all the way down the ballot. Running for the local school board? Beto just might endorse in that race, especially if gun confiscation can be worked into that campaign. O’Rourke said even though he’s still figuring out what his next steps are, he vowed to help Democratic candidates across the country and to continue to address his signature issues such as gun violence. “I’m going to do everything that I can, and what form that takes and in what capacity I don’t know,” he said. “But certainly it will involve supporting great candidates all over this country from school board trustee to the next nominee for the presidency of the Democratic Party.” The “born to run” man tells his supporters that if even one person fails to do their part in our democracy, “then we will fail this country and the generations that follow that are counting on us.” Beto is nothing if not hyperbolic. In his world, extreme political thought is a way of life. Most of all he called for party unity to beat President Trump in 2020. “All of us have to commit to get behind the nominee from this party to make sure that she or he is successful against Donald Trump and then to make sure that once they become president, they help to heal this very divided country,” he said. Without a trace of irony noted, that reference to “this very divided country” didn’t come with an acknowledgment of the role he has played in that division. The overriding theme of his campaign after the mass shooting in El Paso was gun confiscation. That topic alone divides American voters quicker than just about any other issue today. If Michael Bloomberg carries through with his alleged decision to enter the Democrat primary, a Beto endorsement could be just around the corner, given Bloomberg’s funding of PACs like Everytown for Gun Safety. O’Rourke let his ego get the better of his decision-making process when he jumped into the presidential race. He believed all the puff pieces and magazine covers and contributions from Hollywood elites after his run against Ted Cruz in Texas. Suddenly another Senate run wasn’t enough for him. He would only go for the big prize – the presidency. Oprah encouraged him. Cable television interviews didn’t question the fact that he never really articulated a reason for his candidacy, other than a hatred for the bad Orange Man. Then he found his cause after the El Paso shooting tragedy and even the endless interviews on cable television couldn’t save his floundering campaign. Any shot O’Rourke had to defeat John Cornyn was squandered months ago. I never thought he had a chance, anyway, but now the field is getting crowded on the Democrat side. He could make a splash and raise money rather quickly but his time has passed. At least for now. The national exposure Beto got showed Democrats across the country that he’s an empty suit. He can sound passionate and say absolutely nothing. After he recites standard Democrat talking points, he is hard-pressed to discuss actual policy. He’s all about emotions. Senate speculation is still expected to swirl around O’Rourke and another presidential contender from Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, until the Dec. 9 filing deadline. But absent a big-name candidate who is known statewide, the Democratic primary remains in flux with largely unknown contenders. “Everyone’s trying to pull a Beto and catch fire and have millions of dollars falling from the sky at the click of a mouse,” Texas Democratic strategist Colin Strother said. “And no one’s been able to do that yet.” Ten Texas Democrats have filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for Senate, including several credible candidates. Hey, there is always the possibility that Julian Castro will finally throw in the towel and decide he’ll challenge Cornyn. Nah. He would have less chance than Beto. Unlike Beto, I think Castro is a little more aware of his limitations. Beto will be back. He won’t be able to be on the sidelines cheering on other candidates for long. We’ll have him to kick around again. We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020. I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I’m going to be proud to support whoever she or he is. — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) November 1, 2019  Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

Academics have started to try to quantify the impact of mass shootings on mental health, student performance, electoral outcomes, and more. But a paper published in October may be the first to analyze the economics of mass shootings. The research, by economists Abel Brodeur of the University of Ottawa and Hasin Yousaf of the University of New South Wales, has a straightforward message. “Our results suggest that the economic consequences of mass shootings are quite significant for targeted areas,” the authors wrote. The findings come from a tally of 178 “successful” mass shootings from 2000 to 2015 in 136 counties. Brodeur and Yousaf contrast data about those incidents with outcomes from 114 “failed” mass shootings over the same period. (To be considered “successful,” a mass shooting must result in at least four deaths.) Read:The financial and housing market rescue left many Americans behind What is the impact? Employment per capita decreases by about 1% immediately after a successful shooting, and by nearly 2% in the following year. “The effect persists for several years after the shooting and can be seen even three years after a successful mass shooting,” the authors wrote. “We do not see any significant difference in the employment per capita prior to the shooting, suggesting that mass shootings are not the outcome of a local recession.” Per capita earnings decrease by around 1.4% in the immediate aftermath, an outcome that also persists for several years after the event. The number of business establishments decreases by 0.6% immediately afterward, and decreases further for up to three years. All else equal, home prices decline about 3%. As part of an analysis of which industries are most impacted by a shooting — that’s blue collar sectors like manufacturing, goods-producing, natural resources, and mining and construction — the authors noted that mass shootings “significantly decrease employment in the leisure and hospitality industry, suggesting that the number of tourists decreases following a successful incident.” See:The rise of a few ‘superstar cities’ hobbles the job and housing markets Brodeur and Yousaf also analyze the economic profiles of the perpetrators of mass shootings. Even though most such events take place in areas with greater economic activity relative to an average county, about 39% of successful mass shooters were in some kind of financial distress, such as having been fired or having a history of financial difficulties, at the time of the incident. Perpetrators were disproportionately unemployed or out of the labor force: only 42% are employed or serving in the military at the time of the shooting, in comparison to 69% for male Americans aged 20–50. In shootings that take place in workplaces, only 21% of perpetrators are employed. “These results suggest a possible role for job-market interventions aimed at high-risk individuals,” the authors wrote.

123,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/11/08/democrats-2020-advice-rahm-emanuel-229909,"AP Photo/David J. Phillip Opinion What the party needs to learn from this weekâs elections. By RAHM EMANUEL November 08, 2019 Rahm Emanuel is the former mayor of Chicago, former White House chief of staff, and former member of Congress from Illinois. This weekâs elections confirmed two things. One: Democrats are on a winning streak. We flipped Kentuckyâs gubernatorial seat and won control of the Virginia state Legislatureâthis on top of the gains from 2018, when Democrats retook the U.S. House of Representatives, flipped six state houses and picked up seven gubernatorial seats. Two: The playbook Democrats have used to such success in swing states over the past year is being utterly ignored by our partyâs presidential candidates. Every Democrat shares in the conviction that our overriding priority is making Donald Trump a one-term president. Liberal or moderate, weâre united in wanting to win. And after our big victories last November and earlier this monthâwhich saw Democrats victorious not just in safely blue areas but also in competitive suburban communities and battleground statesâthereâs no question about how to get that done. Which is why, for the life of me, I cannot understand why our presidential candidates are failing to heed the lessons from Democratsâ 2018 and 2019 victories. The Democratic candidates who have prevailed in battleground contests since 2016 didnât embrace pie-in-the-sky policy ideas or propose a smorgasbord of new entitlements. They didnât talk constantly about providing a guaranteed basic income. Or promising to make college free. Or eliminating private insurance and replacing it with a government-run health care system. Or giving $250 more each month in Social Security benefits. Or enacting the ""Green New Deal."" Or calling for the immediate and abrupt end of fossil fuels. Or vowing to seize guns from peopleâs homes. During both cycles, we won swing districts and battleground states by using the same playbook: sticking to an agenda that meets voters where and how they live their lives. In tone, tenor and talent, those winning candidates spoke to issues that middle-class voters face every day. Which raises the question: Why arenât our leading presidential candidates looking to replicate that success? Thereâs a gaping disconnect between that successful playbook and the strategic choices on display during the ongoing presidential primary debates. Inexplicably, the men and women who want to be our partyâs standard-bearer seem to be ignoring the unambiguous message voters are sendingâand that should concern anyone who wants to defeat Trump in 2020. Voters of almost all stripes want to vote against Trump. Heâs remarkably unpopular, particularly given that unemployment is at 3.7 percent. From a political perspective, thatâs an unusual gift for us. Other Republicans would know how to take advantage of the current economic conditions, but Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan. No one would ever describe him as a âhappy warrior.â (Frankly, he even makes Richard Nixon look like a ray of sunshine.) A majority of Americans donât like Trumpâs personality, his divisive rhetoric or his performance in office. Thatâs a significant opening for Democratsâbut not a guarantee. Even having been dealt a good hand, we need to play our cards carefully. For too long, Democrats have been engaged internally in a fruitless debate about whether we ought to pursue a strategy that emphasizes persuasion or mobilization. Trump has made that conversation obsolete. He is all the impetus many voters need to get out to the polls. The 2018 midterm elections had a record turnout. And this past Tuesday, Kentuckyâs incumbent Republican governor, Matt Bevin, lost despite getting roughly 200,000 more votes in this yearâs election than he had four years earlier, when he won. The good news for Democrats is that Trump doesnât have enough die-hard voters to win without convincing some voters who are on the fence. The bad news for Democrats? Neither do we. As the 2018 and 2019 elections proved beyond any doubt, if weâre going to prevail in battleground states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, we both need to get our base to the polls and we need to persuade voters that they can safely vote for our candidates, knowing that they are the right choice for the country. Candidates like Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Kentucky Governor-elect Andy Beshear and a host of first-term members of the House of Representatives and a bevy of state legislators around the country have made absolutely plain how to win in battleground states and districts. They established a durable playbook for building coalitions between urban and suburban votersâan alliance that I term the âMetropolitan Majority.â When Whitmer was running for governor, she made âFix the Damn Roads!â her campaign slogan because that phrase spoke to Michigandersâ general frustration that government simply wasnât doing its job. She wasnât offering voters Shangri-La, in large part because she knew they wouldnât believe any elected official could deliver it. Instead, she offered the public an appreciation that getting the basics done well would exceed most peopleâs expectations and help improve their lives in practical, tangible ways. By tapping into the prevailing view, Whitmer was able to fortify our partyâs Metropolitan Majorityâflipping a swing-state gubernatorial seat Republicans had held for eight years. Thatâs why our party enjoyed so much success both in 2018 and then again Tuesday. Whatâs so odd is that despite the lessons of success, our candidates are taking positions during this primary campaign that will almost inevitably be liabilities during the general election. The dissonance is remarkable. Compare what the candidates who won last year and this yearâs elections have done to what the presidential candidates are offering ahead of 2020. On health care, successful Democrats didnât mention ""Medicare for All;"" they explained how they would control prescription drug costs and preserve protections for preexisting conditions. They didnât offer free college; they spoke about equity and fairness across the educational spectrum, from early childhood to higher ed. They didnât talk about the Green New Deal so much as they proposed to expand renewable energy and invest in the jobs and growth that come with it. They didnât offer to guarantee anyoneâs income so much as explained how they would attract good jobs that would provide for a middle-class life. They didnât talk about confiscating guns from law-abiding citizens; they promised to support the background checks that prevent criminals from getting access to weapons. These distinctions matter. The substance of our ideas provides a window into what we care about, whose interests weâll pursue and how we intend to govern. Thatâs why, as a political matter, the Democratic Partyâs agenda needs to be practical, prudent and progressive. In his column yesterday, John Harris argued that itâs not always the âsafeâ Democrats who make history. Maybe so, but thatâs putting the cart before the horse: You canât make history if you donât hold the White House, and that has to be the overwhelming priority this year. Our proposals should be defensible when theyâre attackedâor, even better, they should bait Republicans into revealing how out of touch they really are. How could they be against protecting the health insurance covering people with preexisting conditions? Or keeping automatic weapons out of the hands of convicted criminals? Letâs not give Trump the opportunity to claim that we want to take away peopleâs health insurance. Instead, letâs put him in a position of having to defend the people who offer nothing but thoughts and prayers when thereâs yet another mass shooting in a schoolyard. Thereâs a reason that successful candidates in state and local battlegrounds have chosen this approach: It works both electorally and as an agenda for governing. To win nationwide, we need to focus on building a lasting Metropolitan Majority that binds together the broad collection of liberal, moderate, urban and suburban voters. This can be a historic moment for a party, one in which, beyond beating Trump, we establish a lasting coalition. Letâs let the lessons weâve learned in the past three years point us in a direction that ends the current nightmare, puts the Democratic Party on firm footing and gets the country back on track.

Opinion By Gianno Caldwell Submit November 9, 2019 | 12:25pm Last month, President Trump visited my hometown of Chicago to speak at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference. Sadly, the city’s top cop, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, skipped his event that day in protest. But he, and Chicago’s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, should have attended to hear some hard truths. Trump has been criticizing Chicago leadership since 2016 for allowing the violence to become one of the worst in the world, earning the title in 2015 as America’s mass-shooting capital, and he continued to highlight Chicago’s problems during the conference. In response, Chicago’s mayor suggested Trump focus on his issues in DC, and the liberal press touted the decrease in violence in Chicago in some apparent attempt to prove how out of touch Trump is. The decrease? Through the end of October, there have been 2,242 shooting victims and 424 murders in Chicago. Last year, we had 2,462 shooting victims and 478 murders over the same period. In my reporting for Fox News, the people I have spoken with feel so under siege by the gun violence that this tiny drop doesn’t even register to them, and any talk from a politician who mentions the reduction in murders is a smack in their face because going on their front porch could be a death sentence. My friend Wendy Hill has a similar story. Her brother Emell was 23 and had no association with the gangs when, one Sunday this past October, he was followed home from a gas station and shot seven times in cold blood on his front porch while he attempted to unlock his door, The Chicago Sun-Times reported. He lay breathless while his sister screamed and knocked on neighbors’ doors, crying for help. Emell died before he made it to the hospital. My own younger brother has also been a victim of the violence in Chicago. During Memorial Day weekend in 2017, he and a couple of friends were parked in a car on the South Side when two men approached, pulled out automatic pistols and started firing. Bullets ripped through the car. Shattered windows. Punctured steel. And, then skin. Later, the police would count 25 shell casings. My brother survived, but I could just as easily be discussing him in the past tense. His best friend died in my brother’s arms that night; two more victims of the violence in Chicago. There is another way. First, Chicagoans — of all colors and tax brackets — most come together. Democrats have run the city (and state) for 50-plus years and consider 424 murders an “improvement.” Blindly following the party, any party, is clearly not working. I’ll repeat it: Black lives don’t matter to these people, black votes do. Until my fellow Chicagoans accept this hard truth, we can expect to remain one of the most violent cities on earth. And while I realize this issue is far beyond politics, it is clear the liberal solutions we continue to see offered by local leaders have failed. Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s former chief of staff, was mayor of Chicago from 2011 to 2019 and was nothing more than a failure. He’d offered only promises, higher taxes and “sanctuary” for everyone but the — mostly — African Americans bleeding in our streets. He and the local Democratic leadership sought to decrease gun violence only via stronger gun laws, catapulting Illinois’ gun regulations to among the very strictest in the nation. (Someone should have warned Emanuel that criminals don’t obey the law.) The current mayor, Lightfoot, seems cut from the same cloth, spending more time spouting anti-Trump rhetoric than actually tackling the real problems that her city faces. Second, let’s end the narrative of “they’re not from Chicago” or “they’re a Republican,” so their thoughts don’t matter. The leadership of Chicago should reach out to the “other side,” to any side — with an idea or funding to help. President Obama never truly extended a hand to Chicago (his “adopted hometown”) to stop the violence. He had a unique opportunity to raise the issue of Chicago violence as a national crisis. We’ve now got a leader in Washington who’s willing to work with Chicago to fully fund programs aimed at positive alternatives for at-risk individuals, using interventions shown to have long-term impacts on violent behavior. But “Trump’s not welcome in Chicago,” according to some Illinois politicians. If the president is serious about helping the people in Chicago, and I believe he is, we can’t turn any help away. All too often, policy issues and decisions are being made with decades-old data and assumptions. Of the top 30 causes of death in the United States, gun violence is the least researched. According to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, gun violence should have received almost $1.5 billion in federal research money between 2004 and 2015 and instead received a total of only $22 million. The lack of research condemns policymakers to remain ignorant about many aspects of gun violence, including the most effective ways to reduce violence. There are thousands of studies waiting to be performed, and more than 100 medical organizations have beseeched Congress to restore funding for this research. We must add our voices to that demand. “All over the world,” Trump scolded, “they’re talking about Chicago.” But Chicago is not an isolated problem. Detroit, St. Louis, Memphis, Baltimore, Kansas City, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Oakland. Chicago is in a national crisis, and one murder is too many. Posturing and politics must end. There’s been enough bloodshed. And the world is watching.

126,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/army-times/news/your-army/~3/S4ssIQ79554/,"AUSTIN, Texas — On a Friday night in October, Patrick Zeigler lay in a tattoo shop in Daytona Beach. His shirt off and chest bare, he braced as the tattoo gun pierced his skin. He had mulled the design for several months — the date ""5NOV09,"" surrounded by a circle of thirteen stars, one for every person killed in the massacre 10 years ago at Fort Hood. Ziegler timed the appointment just so, to give the tattoo enough time to heal before the 10th anniversary of the shooting Tuesday. He asked that one of the stars be made gold, in honor of all the other lives that were torn apart that day, among them, his own. The shooting sparked more awareness of terror-sponsored attacks versus those simply “inspired” by terrorist organizations. A former Army staff sergeant who served two tours in Iraq, Zeigler was one of more than 30 who were injured in the mass shooting in 2009, which was carried out by a former Army psychiatrist and Islamic extremist in the Soldier Readiness Processing Center of the post in Killeen, a military town north of Austin. Of those who survived, Zeigler's injuries were among the most serious. A bullet that penetrated his skull caused him to lose 20% of his brain. Now, the 38-year-old still relies on a cane to walk some days. His left hand is limp and mostly unusable. Because the bullet struck in the right hemisphere, the left side of his body remains slow to heal. Wounds on those limbs often turn to open sores that linger for weeks.

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Army Times Daily News Roundup. Zeigler told the Austin American-Statesman that he usually wears some kind of military attire, an Army hat or T-shirt, so that when people notice his injuries they don’t ask any questions. They assume he was hurt in the war. Yet, despite serving in combat during the bloodiest time in the Iraq War in 2007, it was back home, on American soil, that Zeigler sustained his traumatic injuries. ""I have irritability and frustration beyond measure. That's mostly just due to my disabilities,"" he told the American-Statesman, speaking candidly about his recovery. ""But the anger, the deeper anger that's involved with all of it is still there below the surface. It's something that I've had to struggle with."" Today, Zeigler lives in a 1,900-square-foot apartment on the beach in northern Florida, just a mile from his grandmother's home. He said the ocean has been healing. From his window, he can see the ice blue water and hear the waves lap hypnotically against the shore. ""Some days, I power walk on the beach. And I can do the elliptical machine and kind of keep the weight off if I'm smart about food and stuff,"" Zeigler said. ""There's definitely ways around the impairments that I've faced. You just make disabilities into abilities. That's the key for me."" When paramedics found Zeigler, he was lying on the ground outside the Soldier Readiness Processing Center behind a trail of his own blood. Believing he would die, they secured a black tag around his toe. It wasn't until Zeigler started screaming that a medic rushed him to an ambulance, then to a hospital in nearby Temple. Zeigler had sustained a gunshot wound to his right temporal lobe, as well as three others to his shoulder, arm and hip. Doctors said at the time that he had a 1 in 10 chance of surviving. Maj. Nidal Hasan, the shooter, had fired 241 rounds in 10 minutes, killing 12 soldiers and one civilian employee and injuring more than 30 others before two Fort Hood civilian police officers were able to bring him down with gunfire. Those who survived, including many who had survived combat, said the scene mirrored a war zone. For Zeigler, the day had started like any other. He woke early and went to physical training and morning formation, then made his way to the center to complete paperwork that was required of all soldiers who return from overseas. Zeigler had only returned to the U.S. from Iraq 12 days earlier, leaving ahead of the rest of his unit to attend Officer Candidate School, a lifelong dream. At lunch, he had Hawaiian barbecue. After, he sat in his car for about an hour and smoked a cigarette. Zeigler recalled that he almost went home then but decided instead to finish the last things on his list that day: a visit to a psychologist and checking to make sure his vaccinations were up to date. He entered the center, a giant room with only a few scattered cubicles, and sat in the second row of chairs. Around him, people milled about and chatted with one another — most bored from a long day doing paperwork. At 1:34 p.m., a man armed with a semi-automatic pistol stood up and shouted, ""Allahu Akbar!"" ""I knew what the words meant,"" Zeigler said, remembering the moment his eyes fixed on Hasan's. Faced with the reflex to fight or flee, he froze. ""I didn't realize what the hell was happening,"" Zeigler said. ""Then he turned around 180 degrees and started shooting."" Zeigler saw the red laser that fixed on his face, then felt the sensation of metal striking his head. His ears rung as the bullet broke through bone and shattered into tiny pieces. The force was so strong it knocked him out of his chair. Panicked, he crawled to escape. But as he struggled to catch his breath, he lost consciousness. He woke to Hasan standing over him and firing three more times. ""It's almost like a stereotypical thing where he just looked really, you know, pissed off at the world. There was just rage on his face,"" Zeigler said. ""He had been working up to that point for years. So, he was really focused. And so was I, honestly, in the first hours afterwards. I just tried to stay awake because I knew going to sleep would be the worst thing."" Zeigler was afraid if he closed his eyes he might never wake up. The first year was touch and go. Doctors tried continually to cover the hole in Zeigler's skull to protect his brain. In total, he had nine brain surgeries and had to re-learn to walk three times. After each surgery, his leg muscles would atrophy and he would forfeit all the progress he had made. His then-girlfriend, eventual wife and now ex-wife, Jessica Hansen, stood by him. The outpouring of support he received from fellow veterans and strangers was so great that, still today, Zeigler counts it among his biggest blessings. The Statesman previously chronicled Zeigler's recovery in a story published in 2010. He has made numerous strides since then. After doing outpatient rehab, he was able to walk without a cane. Doctors cut him down from eight medications a day to three. And he started doing group therapy to deal with the emotional fallout of the shooting. Despite suffering with chronic pain, he lives a relatively normal life today. ""My PTSD is mild compared to a lot of people's,"" Zeigler said. ""I credit that to my upbringing. Growing up in a military family, I was just a little bit stronger-minded, I guess, stronger-willed."" Zeigler was raised on military bases. His father was a Navy recruit division commander, the equivalent of a drill sergeant. Zeigler always had aspirations to fight overseas. After graduating from Florida State University, he said he was drinking heavily and had lost his sense of direction. The year was 2005, and there were two wars going on at the time. Zeigler decided to join the Army. ""I wanted to do something extraordinary,"" he said. ""I wanted to be a tool of the U.S. government and I just wanted to lead soldiers, you know, during a battle or during a conflict. And it turns out I did, but not in the same way that I expected."" Zeigler was a scout with the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, which was stationed in Iraq's Diyala River Valley during the war. They engaged in firefights and dodged roadside bombs. On Memorial Day 2007, one exploded, killing six in Zeigler's troop. ""I actually was thinking more of dying than getting hurt like this,"" Zeigler said, thinking back on his time in combat. ""You don't really think about having a long-term health issue. For me, it was just more I signed up for a pretty dangerous job. I wasn't apathetic, but I was . just, you know, expecting to not make it through the first year, I guess."" Ziegler did make it through that first year, though, and more than that, he fell in love with the Army. He decided he wanted to be a commissioned officer and command a unit of soldiers. It was one of many dreams stolen from him the day of the shooting. In 2011, Zeigler was forced to retire from the Army. ""That's when they started telling me about the new normal. 'You gotta accept this new normal. You're not going to be a soldier,'"" he said. Zeigler did not take it lightly. For many years, he battled depression, which reached its lowest point after the birth of his son, Liam, in 2012. ""I didn't know how to adapt to being a paralyzed, handicapped father,"" Zeigler said. ""I couldn't do anything. I couldn't change a diaper. My one big task that I accomplished a lot was taking out the trash after my ex had tied it up and gotten it ready to go and then I would take it outside."" Liam was a colicky baby. Twice, Zeigler ended up in psych wards when he couldn't take the sound of his crying any longer. He and Jessica had moved to Minnesota to be closer to her family. The bitter cold and long winters were hard on his psyche. The two fought often, and his drinking took on a destructive nature. It seemed, for a time, that the life Zeigler had fought so valiantly to hold onto was slipping away. Then, as quickly as a heavy fog rolls in, the darkness lifted. ""I just had kind of a moment of clarity, like, 'Why would I take my life that was given to me and waste it like this?'"" Zeigler said. ""I decided to get up off my ass, out of bed and start doing as much as I could to stay busy and keep my mind and body occupied."" Zeigler moved back to Florida, where he grew up, to be closer to the beach and the healing warmth of the sun. He helped other veterans through volunteering and traveled around the world. In 2018, he and Jessica divorced. However, they remain on good terms and share custody of Liam, who visits Zeigler several times a year. ""Thank God, I didn't listen to doctors who said I wasn't going do anything,"" Zeigler said. ""That's pretty common in people with traumatic injuries, where they just don't accept the situation."" The second time Zeigler faced Hasan was in a courtroom at Fort Hood in 2013, during Hasan's death penalty trial. One by one, victims and their family members took to the stand to share how their lives had been decimated by Hasan's actions. Zeigler said he prepared mentally and physically for that day, perfecting his gait so he could walk without a cane to the witness stand. During his testimony, he looked at Hasan only once. Zeigler spoke about his injuries and the challenges of caring for his son. At the conclusion, Hasan, who admitted to carrying out the shooting to defend the lives of Taliban leadership in Afghanistan, was convicted of 13 counts of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. His conviction is under appeal and he remains on death row. An execution date has not been set. Zeigler said he has since forgiven Hasan — a decision he made after Liam was born — because he couldn't live with the anger any longer. ""I knew from experience that if I held the grudge against him or thought about him all the time, I'd be giving him the power and I could just be Christian and forgive him,"" Zeigler said. ""He was just a soldier, and he thought he was doing the right thing. And I know I can relate to that. You know, I didn't go killing a bunch of innocent people in Iraq, but I can totally understand that he felt like it was his duty. So, I forgave him."" Zeigler doesn't define himself as a victim or a survivor. In his eyes, he is, first and always, a soldier. Unfortunately, he said his military service is often overshadowed by the tragedy of that day. But as he sat down to write a book last year about his life, it was his memories in combat, not necessarily of the shooting, that rose to the forefront. ""I don't think that Fort Hood should ever be the only thing that ever defines you,"" he said. ""I went to war for two years."" Zeigler said he expects to release the book next year. He plans to give whatever money he earns from sales to veteran nonprofits, including the Florida-based 22 Project, which helps soldiers recover from traumatic brain injuries and PTSD with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which uses air pressure to increase oxygen flow through the body. Zeigler said the treatment has helped him remarkably and that even his brain scans are showing improvement. Today, he tries to focus on living. Going to the beach. Traveling. Spending time with his son. ""There'll be plenty more hospital time in my life and tubes and tests and all that good stuff,"" he said. ""I just want to enjoy my life."" In Killeen, about 5 miles southeast of Fort Hood, a memorial has been erected with bronze sculptures honoring each of the 13 victims. Seven thousand miles away, Zeigler sank his head, marked on the right side with a giant scar, into the River Jordan during a guided tour through Israel, timed to the anniversary. Zeigler said the trip was a chance for renewal. ""I haven't been always the nicest and the most Christian person,"" he said. ""I think that it'll be a really good thing going forward for the next year or two."" Asked whether he's still angry about being shot, Zeigler said no. “I feel I kind of took one for the team,” he said. “Hopefully, I saved somebody (else’s) life.”     ",2019-11-10 00:01:20,Soldier’s recovery from Fort Hood shooting was long march,,79587,http://www.marinetimes.com/#spider
127,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/10/nikki-haley-book-tillerson-kelly-trump,"Last modified on Wed 6 Jan 2021 23.57 GMT Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, has claimed former secretary of state Rex Tillerson and former White House chief of staff John Kelly tried to recruit her to work around Donald Trump in an effort to “save the country”.  Haley, who left the administration last year, makes the claim in a book, With All Due Respect, that will be published on Tuesday, the Washington Post reported. In Haley’s telling, Tillerson told her that if Trump was left unchecked, people would die. “Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren’t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country,” Haley writes. The pair told her that “it was their decisions, not the president’s, that were in the best interests of America” and “the president didn’t know what he was doing”. Haley’s claims add to a picture of the White House as a hive of insurrection, with former business leaders, diplomats, career politicians and aides attempting to stymie the wilder impulses of a wildly unconventional president. In September 2018, Watergate reporter Bob Woodward published Fear, an account of Trump’s first year in power in which senior aides were reported removing documents from the Resolute Desk. Two books by Michael Wolff, Fire and Fury and Siege, have painted a similar picture of dysfunction, faction and chaos. Another new book on the Trump presidency is due on 19 November. A Warning, by an anonymous administration official, has been extensively reported. Among its contents is a description of a president spiralling from crisis to crisis “like a 12-year-old in an air traffic control tower”. The author, who last year produced an explosive column in the New York Times, reportedly claims that some White House officials drew up plans for a mass resignation, or “midnight self-massacre”, to draw attention to Trump’s behaviour. Tillerson, who was secretary of state from 2017 until he was fired by tweet in March 2018, reportedly while on the toilet, did not respond to requests for comment, the Post said. But Kelly offered a pseudo-confirmation of Haley’s claims, saying that if providing the president “with the best and most open, legal and ethical staffing advice from across the [government] so he could make an informed decision is ‘working against Trump’, then guilty as charged.” Kelly recently earned Trump’s ire by telling an audience in Georgia the president faced impeachment because he had not listened to his former chief of staff’s advice. Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, writes that she agreed with many of Trump’s most controversial decisions, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord and relocating the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Speaking to the Post, Haley said that though she opposed Trump’s infamous request to the Ukrainian president for a public investigation into Joe Biden, a political rival, “it’s hard for me to understand where the whole impeachment situation is coming from, because what everybody’s up in arms about didn’t happen”. Trump and senior aides are alleged to have withheld nearly $400m in military aid and dangled the prospect of a White House meeting, in a clear quid pro quo. Public hearings in the House impeachment inquiry will begin this week. “Do I think the president did something that warrants impeachment?” Haley asked. “No, because the aid flowed. And, in turn, the Ukrainians didn’t follow up with the investigation.” In her book, the Post said, Haley does show herself standing up to Trump, including over his relationship with Russian president Vladi­mir Putin and over what she calls his “moral equivalence” in blaming “both sides” after a white supremacist march in Charlottesville turned deadly in August 2017. “A leader’s words matter in these situations,” she writes. “And the president’s words had been hurtful and dangerous. I picked up the phone and called the president.” Haley also discusses her response as governor to a mass shooting at an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina, in the summer of 2015. In the aftermath, she says, she was treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. Haley has been talked of as a possible replacement for Mike Pence as Trump’s vice-president but her report of Tillerson and Kelly’s efforts is likely to ruffle presidential feathers. She adds that she argued that Trump had been elected, so if they disagreed with his policies strongly enough, they should quit. “I just couldn’t get my arms around the fact that here you have two key people in an administration undermining the president,” Haley told the Post.",2019-11-10 14:50:38,Nikki Haley: Tillerson and Kelly tried to block Trump to 'save country',,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

09:31 This is where we’ll leave our rolling coverage today. Guardian Australia will be covering all the developments tomorrow. Here’s what’s happened so far: 9.00am GMT
09:00 ABC Weather has published an explanation of why Tuesday is looking so bad: it’s a cold front. “Tomorrow with the winds you’ll be seeing a more south-easterly direction,” Grace Legge, senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, told the ABC. “Once that change comes through, it changes the direction that the fire’s going, which means that you normally end up with a large fire front as the wind changes direction and moves the opposite way. “You’d start to see the fires moving more north-easterly once a change has gone through.” Why a cold front signals disaster for fire danger https://t.co/NOr4mZ54B3 via @ABCNews pic.twitter.com/3ZrwsfqZeg 8.11am GMT
08:11 From AAP: Horse owners are being urged to move their animals to a safe place in the face of the catastrophic bushfire threat. The Australian Veterinary Association has warned that horses should not be locked in confined stables but rather placed in well-grazed paddocks. Dr Sam Nugent, president of Equine Veterinarians Australia, said the key was to act early. “It’s critical not to lock your horses in a stable, holding yard or similar environment, as they may panic and hurt themselves if confined,” he said. “In addition, the EVA asks that you remove all gear from your horse as it could get caught on fences, melt or become very hot and cause serious burns, plus do not leave rugs on your horse.” The AVA said the ideal environment is a large or series of small well-grazed paddocks with the internal gates left open, and warned horses should not be let onto roads where they could face danger from traffic as well as fire. Northern Beaches Council mayor Michael Regan said it had opened Frenchs Forest Showground and North Narrabeen reserve for local residents to temporarily relocate large animals including horses.

07:57 Carol Sparks is the mayor of Glen Innes Severn council, where devastating fires on Friday claimed at least two lives. She has written an op-ed which you can find here. Here’s an excerpt: Already there are armchair experts ready with free advice about meeting with disaster. Let it be made perfectly clear that all the area that burned has already been a fire ground for two months. There were hazard reduction and backburns under state authority last month and last year. The properties were all well-prepared and extensively defended. People who have lived with fire risk for decades knew exactly what to do, and they did it. The full expertise and advice of fire controllers has been heeded at every turn. I’ll put my 20-year Rural Fire Service medal up against your free advice any day of the week. The anger is real. The anger is justified. Because this disaster was all foreseen and predicted. For decades the link between a hotter, drier climate, land-clearing, excessive irrigation and increased fire risk have all been attested in scientific papers. Equally for decades there have been those who insist they know better. Their ignorance and arrogance have delivered us only ashes – let these now be swept away. Updated

07:41 Nick Stanley of the South Australian CFS has told ABC local radio there are more than 100 firefighters from 26 ground crews, eight waterbombing aircraft and three observation aircraft currently working on the fire threatening Port Lincoln. “We’re still seeing some fairly strong winds around the 50km/h mark, gusting 80-90km/h when this fire started,” he said. “Trying to control a fire under those conditions is near-on impossible.” Updated
            at 8.23am GMT 7.32am GMT
07:32 The NSW RFS has reminded people it is not telling people to evacuate ahead of tomorrow, just to “avoid bushfire prone areas”. That could mean leaving your home and going to a large town or city, or to a shopping centre or another place far away from a bushland area. Tomorrow will see very dangerous fire conditions across NSW. Is the NSW RFS telling people to evacuate? No. A simple thing to do is avoid bush fire prone areas. Safer areas may be a large town or city, shopping centres or facilities far away from bushland areas. #nswrfs #nswfires pic.twitter.com/ilpZkuPtrs 7.22am GMT
07:22 NSW Police have issued warnings and advice for the state’s population ahead of Tuesday’s serious fire conditions and total fire ban. “If you are threatened by fire, you need to take action to protect yourself. Do not be caught in the open,” it said a short time ago. There are simply not enough fire trucks for every house. If you call for help, you may not get it. Do not expect a firetruck. Do not expect a knock on the door. Do not expect a phone call.” “Start taking action now to reduce your risk: Lists of evacuation centres will be posted here by the RFS, and police keep their updates here. 7.10am GMT
07:10 Defence bases have been given orders to provide any an all assistance required to local firefighting forces. Defence minister Linda Reynolds has asked the chief of the ADF, General Angus Campbell, “to give an order to local base commanders, making clear that they have the authority to use Defence resources to respond to any local contingencies”. “Senior ADF officers and other commanders are empowered to provide emergency assistance in local emergency situations to save human life, prevent extensive loss of animal life, or widespread damage to property,” she said. “While our ADF personnel are not trained firefighters, they can provide other support for the nation’s front line first responders.” 7.03am GMT
07:03 In South Australia the CFS has issued an emergency warning in the last hour for Duck Ponds, in the Lower Eyre Peninsula, where a fire is burning in an easterly direction towards Port Lincoln. “The Western Approach Rd, Duck Ponds fire is uncontrolled,” it said. “You are now in danger. Take shelter in a solid building. Do not leave or enter this area in a vehicle or on foot. It is too late to leave as the roads will not be safe. Conditions are dangerous and firefighters are now unable to prevent the fire spreading. Shelter before the fire arrives as heat can kill you well before the flames reach you.” Fire burning outside Port Lincoln, residents being urged to seek shelter now pic.twitter.com/vUl4Xf7RSb The White Hut fire which was an emergency earlier this afternoon has now been contained, but the CFS warns “a fast moving wind change is still expected this afternoon which may cause the fire to spread rapidly in a north easterly or easterly direction toward the locality of White Hut, Hundred Line Road and the Yorke Highway”. An update on the Queensland situation: There are 10 fires at advice level, and four watch and act fires: Cobraball, Townson, Clumber and Thornton. And in NSW: There are 48 advice level fires burning across the state and 10 watch and act fires: Carral Creek, Carrai East, Coombes Gap complex, Hillville, Kian Road, Liberation Trail, Bril Bril, Mt Nardi national park, Newton Boyd and Coombadjha.

06:40 Towns and communities west of the highway in the Coffs Harbour and Bellingen region are being advised to get clear of their homes tomorrow. This is a community newsletter released earlier this afternoon advising resident they will face “extreme fire danger” on Tuesday, with smoke and embers from the significant fires nearby potentially affecting areas kilometres ahead of the fires, predicted to spread to Coffs Harbour and the northern beaches. It’s advised residents in areas west of the Pacific highway to self-relocate to a major urban area like Coffs Harbour, Woolgoolga, Sawtell, Bellingen, Urunga, and Dorrigo, but warned that some places east of the highway are not safe enough to take refuge. 6.32am GMT
06:32 The warnings from authorities that people in areas of concern should leave for somewhere safer is not one to take lightly. Even the chief of the Blue Mountains Rural Fire Service is getting out. David Jones has urged residents to consider leaving their homes before late this afternoon, the Blue Mountains Gazette has reported. “I really think leaving is the best option, we don’t want to lose lives,” he told the paper. “I encourage people to go, I think it’s the best. My family are going, even though my house at Medlow Bath is well prepared.” Updated
            at 6.39am GMT 6.18am GMT
06:18 Earlier, the mayor of the mid-north coast council, David West said the next few days “could be the most hazardous this community has ever had”. The north coast has been hardest hit so far by the fires that have been burning since Friday. But West told the ABC earlier his community was “very resilient”. “They’re country people,” he said. “Not only were they supporting each other, the community is supporting them as well. Huge donations of clothing, huge donations of help, to such a degree they had to turn people away. That’s what makes regional New South Wales and regional Australia a very strong and vibrant community. “Council is doing all it can, we’re basically ceasing general operations of council and putting resources into supporting the community moving forward. The next three days could be the most hazardous this community has ever had.” 6.01am GMT
06:01 In the latest from the Nationals-Greens sniping over bushfires and climate and blame: Barnaby Joyce has told the Australian it’s “Greens policy” that has made the threat worse, by locking up dams and preventing enough hazard reduction burns, and – I kid you not – making trees fall over on forest roads. “So many of the practicalities of fighting a fire and managing it have been stymied by the Greens,” Joyce has said. “A lot of people are talking once more about Indigenous land management because they didn’t have to go through 1,001 reports that they have to go through today.” He said there was nothing the parliament has done which brought about the devastation. “The problems we have got have been created by the Greens,” he said. “We haven’t had the capacity to easily access [hazard] reduction burns because of all of the paperwork that is part of green policy. “We don’t have access to dams because they have been decommissioned on national parks because of green policy. We have trees that have fallen over vehicles and block roads, so people cannot either get access to fight a fire or to get away from fires. And we can’t knock over the trees because of Greens policy.” It comes after Greens MP Adam Bandt said “thoughts and prayers aren’t enough” and the government had done “everything in their power” to make fires more likely, which deputy PM Michael McCormack labeled the “ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies”.

            at 6.09am GMT 5.47am GMT
05:47 But professor and bushfire researcher Jim McLennan from La Trobe University has said other residents in more metropolitan areas, around the country, were not as ready as they should be. “In the major capital cities, with population growth on the bushland fringes and more hot days with longer no-rain periods, there are city-dwellers who don’t appreciate they are now on the fringe of fire areas,” he told AAP. “In areas of greater population density, you are likely to get major problems with traffic, the possibility of accidents and tragedies. “A lot of people are not bushfire-ready.” 5.37am GMT
05:37 The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, says the region is “well seasoned” and prepared for tomorrow’s catastrophic conditions. The Blue Mountains experienced devastating blazes in 2013, losing over 200 homes. “I’ve been speaking to residents today who are quietly preparing,” he told AAP. “Our community quietly gets about doing what it needs to do.” 5.26am GMT
05:26 The bushfire in South Australia on the Yorke Peninsula has been downgraded to watch and act. At 1.30 AEDT, fire authorities said it posed a threat to lives and property. But firefighters have now halted the fire’s advance and there have been no lives lost and damage to property. But, an approaching wind change could push the fire to the east. 5.17am GMT
05:17 The latest update from the Department of Education has declared even more schools – both public and non-government – are closed tomorrow. We already reported that hundreds of schools would be closed on Tuesday, after a major announcement around 2.30pm. But to recap, and consolidate the new schools, the ABC is reporting that 367 schools are now closed across NSW. These are all through the catastrophic fire danger areas of the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Greater Hunter. There are also numerous schools closed in metropolitan parts of Sydney near areas of bush. The full list is here. Updated

She talks about why she’s been hiring women and people of colour, and campaigning with Time’s Up Last modified on Thu 14 Nov 2019 10.27 GMT Eva Longoria is almost certainly not who you think she is. Like many actors, she is known for one particular role – in her case, the flighty, fabulous former model Gabrielle Solis, the character she played in the TV comedy-drama Desperate Housewives. Filthy rich, with a penchant for topless gardeners and designer labels, Gaby filled the void left by Sex and the City in the early 2000s. While playing her, Longoria was busy studying for her masters, writing a thesis about the necessity of having more Latinas – women of Latin American descent – in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) in the US. She is deeply political, outspoken and now successful behind the camera, scheduled to direct two feature films next year. This is the first time a Latina will be the director of two major studio films, and she fought off stiff competition from almost 30 other directors to make one of them, Flamin’ Hot, a biopic of the Mexican businessman behind Flamin’ Hot Cheetos. “You have to go in the room triple prepared,” she says, “more educated on the subject, and with more bells and whistles than any man.”  We meet at the Beverly Hills mansion that Longoria, 44, shares with her third husband, the Mexican media mogul José Bastón and their one-year-old son, Santiago. Aside from Desperate Housewives, Longoria is known for starring in a handful of unremarkable films such as the romcoms Over Her Dead Body (2008) and Overboard (2018) and adverts for L’Oréal and Sheba. But she says her life’s work revolves around some of the themes she explored in her masters. Longoria’s mother was a special education teacher, her sister has special needs, and her earliest memory is of volunteering, aged four, at the Special Olympics. “I remember being a ‘hugger’,” she says. “That was a job – and I was like: ‘This is the best job in the world.’” She traces her interest in philanthropy to her family background and, in 2012, the year Desperate Housewives finished, launched a foundation that offers mentoring, scholarships and business training to Latinas. As a Mexican-American, growing up in Texas, Longoria faced specific barriers. “Colourism is in a lot of cultures,” she says. “You know, this myth that the lighter you are, the better you are.” As a child, she was significantly darker than her three sisters. “I had dark hair, dark skin and dark eyes. I didn’t look like anybody in my family.” Did she feel discriminated against? “I remember climbing on the school bus and seeing a sea of blond people and somebody whispering: ‘She’s Mexican.’ I was like: ‘Well, I’m American, I don’t know what that means,’ but I knew it was intended to be negative. I was almost leaning into my heritage after that, because I wanted to be proud of it and everything that my culture represents.” I wonder whether she thinks the situation in the US is better or worse today. “That’s a good question,” she says. “There was progress and change in our country and then all of that was dismantled with the current administration. I feel like every time you have two steps forward, you have two steps back. There is not a lot of opportunity for disenfranchised communities today.” In August, 22 people were killed in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso – the deadliest attack on Latinos in recent US history. Longoria was part of the You Are Not Alone campaign, a love letter to the Latino community signed by 250 entertainment and industry leaders, including Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin. When she was given an award for this work, she quipped: “As a ninth generation ‘Texican’, I’m more American than Donald Trump.” “It’s a scary time for Latinos in the United States because we’re being villainised,” she says. “A lot of my philanthropic efforts are at the border, trying to make sure families are not separated, babies are reunited with their mothers and children aren’t put in cages. The family separation policies are horrendous, so that’s where I want to put more focus.” Longoria says she went into a “depression” when Trump was first elected in 2016. “I did put my head in the sand. I took a break for about two years. But you can’t give up. So when the mid-terms came along, I participated in helping people get elected to change the way our government looks. It should reflect reality, which is people of colour and women. Making sure it reflects society is going to be my lifelong struggle.” She is worried about next year’s presidential election. “The stakes are really high. Globally, the level of intolerance has risen everywhere … I think the most powerful part of our democracy is the citizen. If we can aggregate enough citizens who love as strongly as those who are spewing hate, we have a chance.” Who is she backing? “Nobody yet, because we’re in the primaries and there are 180 people in the primaries right now,” she says, exaggerating just a little. “But I will back whoever the Democratic nominee is, for sure.” Longoria’s time is so taken up with politics, I wonder if she has considered getting more involved. She looks at me blankly. “I am involved.” What about running for Congress? “People think that in order to create change, you have to be a politician,” she sighs. “That’s a myth. You can be anybody. You can be a concerned mother and create significant change. Politicians get their hands tied with the bureaucracy of what comes with being a politician as opposed to speaking their truth and their mind and not being beholden to special interests.” When she was working as an actor, she says, she realised she was not reaching her full potential. “I would say my lines and leave. I didn’t get a say in who my co-star was, pick the words coming out of my mouth or what take they were going to use. That’s why I became a producer – to have control of the final product.” She notes that her acting experience was pretty typical – “it’s not like anybody was abusive” – and says she still loves being an actor. But over the past decade, her attention has turned increasingly towards directing and producing. “People think I’m an actor-turned-director and producer, but I think I was always a director/producer who happened to fall into acting. I’ve been directing TV for 10 years.” Her work includes episodes of the hit comedies Jane the Virgin and Black-ish, and she has produced two documentaries about agricultural labour, The Harvest (2010) and Food Chains (2014). In Desperate Housewives, Longoria starred alongside Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross, and when the show was at the height of its success, rumours abounded of behind-the-scenes rivalry and bullying. Longoria recently referred to an unnamed co-worker in a letter of support she wrote for Huffman when Huffman became embroiled in the college admissions scandal in the US, eventually convicted for paying thousands of dollars to boost her daughter’s university admission score. “I dreaded the days I had to work with that person because it was pure torture,” wrote Longoria, “until one day, Felicity told the bully ‘enough’ and it all stopped. Felicity could feel that I was riddled with anxiety even though I never complained or mentioned the abuse to anyone.” The day we meet, Huffman has been released from prison after serving 11 days of her 14-day sentence, but Longoria won’t be pressed on the matter. “You can ask,” she says, “but I won’t answer.” Longoria is a founding member of Time’s Up, formed in January 2018 in response to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the growing strength of the #MeToo movement; more than $22m (£17m) has been raised for its legal defence fund. “The greatest success of Time’s Up is creating a global conversation about inequality in the workplace,” she says. “That’s a big accomplishment to bring it out of the shadows and have somebody in France go: ‘I thought that was just here. That’s happening in Brazil?’ And someone in Brazil going: ‘That’s happening in the United States?’” Longoria is due to produce, direct and star in the film 24/7 alongside Kerry Washington next year, a workplace comedy set in a post-Time’s Up world, “making fun at the expense of men, finally,” she says. I ask if she feels there has been significant change when it comes to sexual harassment and discrimination in the past few years. “In the US, we have a case against McDonald’s, a case against the FBI, we just changed the state laws in New York City ... so, yeah, we have so many accomplishments to applaud and it’s due to the work of so many women and all of the survivors who were brave enough to come forward.” Women face a lot of unconscious bias in Hollywood, she says. “There are so many talented females, but when looking [to fill] positions, studios will give you Tom, Dick and Harry. You ask: ‘Are there any women?’, and they go: ‘Oh, yeah, we do have some women.’ It’s a second thought. They’re not the first names they serve up.” She hopes to make a difference as a producer and director. “I always start filling up slots with women and people of colour first, then if anything’s left, we will look elsewhere,” she says. “So instead of unconsciously ignoring women or people of colour, I’m consciously hiring them.” She says she pitched and pitched for the job directing Flamin’ Hot, “and after the fifth callback they were going to make their decision and my agent says: ‘What are you most nervous about?’ I said: ‘That I’m going to get it, and then I’m going to have to do everything I promised, because I promised a lot of things in that room.” Eva Longoria will be hosting her annual Eva Longoria Foundation dinner gala honouring American Ferrera and Howard G.

By Trip Gabriel RICHMOND, Va. — Nine months ago, Democrats at every stratum in Virginia called on Gov. Ralph Northam to resign over a racist photograph on his medical school yearbook page. Mr. Northam bumbled his response, admitting he was in the picture before saying he was not, then seemed like he might demonstrate Michael Jackson’s moonwalk at a news conference where he acknowledged blackening his face for a dance contest. Now, after Democrats won control of the Legislature on Tuesday, Mr. Northam is positioned to be one of the most consequential Democratic governors in America in 2020, aiming to enact strong gun restrictions and L.G.B.T.Q. protections and clear the way to take down Confederate statues — all potential headline-making changes that could galvanize the party base nationally in the presidential race. For Mr. Northam, a medical doctor with a rural drawl, and a political moderate whom Republicans once hoped to recruit, it is an astonishing reversal of fortune. His salvaging of a year that began in disaster is a testament to a political age in which the half-life of scandal is brief and where suburban voters are punishing Republicans because of President Trump. It also reflects Mr. Northam’s own efforts, largely out of the headlines, in repairing the damage with black constituents and lawmakers. There are two Democrats running for president. Here’s the latest data to track how the candidates are doing. Virginians “supported me through this,” Mr. Northam said in an interview. “And they supported what our agenda has been on Tuesday, and now we need to deliver.” Nudged to reflect on his personal arc of the past nine months, the governor deflected, steering attention instead to achievements in his two years in office: Medicaid expansion, criminal justice reform and luring an Amazon headquarters to Northern Virginia. “My drive is to serve Virginia. That's been my life, one of service,” he said earnestly. The scandalous events of February that drew intense media attention played no apparent role in dampening enthusiasm for Democratic candidates on Election Day, as the party once feared. “I kind of forgot about the blackface until you brought it up just now,” Tanisha Kelly, an adviser at a group home in the Richmond suburbs, said last week after voting for Democratic state lawmakers. She said the governor had seemed invisible during the campaign, making little impression on her. Most governors love the limelight during an election season, but Mr. Northam may have helped himself this year by quietly tending to alliances and candidates and largely letting events play out rather than be seen as trying to stage manage them. And by all appearances he seemed fine letting other politicians cut a bigger figure on the campaign trail. Mr. Northam did appear at get-out-the-vote rallies in the final weeks before Election Day, and at two dozen political events over the summer. But his predecessor, Terry McAuliffe, who in the spring ended a flirtation with a presidential run, was far more visible on the campaign trail. Mr. McAuliffe’s boisterous glad-handing was the opposite of Mr. Northam’s measured reserve. The former governor popped up at more than 125 parades and political events for candidates, sparking rumors that he might run again for governor in 2021. (Mr. Northam will be ineligible because Virginia governors cannot serve back-to-back terms.) While Mr. Northam’s political action committee raised $1.5 million for Democrats on the ballot, it was a more modest sum than the $7.1 million that Mr. McAuliffe raked in for legislative races four years ago. “What brought people to the polls on Tuesday, it was to vote for Governor Northam’s agenda,” said Jennifer Carroll Foy, a member of the House of Delegates. “I believe that no one wants to get in the way of what he can do here in Virginia.’’ In the end, money was no problem: It rained down on Democrats from national anti-gun and abortion rights groups, and from individual donors in the state and around the country. All were driven to flip the General Assembly, where Republicans’ narrow majorities were the last barrier to unified Democratic control of state government for the first time in 26 years. Party officials and analysts in Virginia said Mr. Northam owed his political survival to fortuitous events as well as his own efforts. Just days after the surfacing of Mr. Northam’s 1984 yearbook photo — with one figure in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes — the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexual abuse by two women, which he denied. Before the week was out, Attorney General Mark R. Herring acknowledged he had worn blackface as a college student. With the state’s top three Democrats compromised, the desire to force them from office and make way for the Republican next in line lost appeal to many in the party. Republican candidates who reminded voters of Mr. Northam’s past had little success in the fall. Glen Sturtevant, a state senator in difficult terrain in the Richmond suburbs, ran TV ads flashing the yearbook picture and accusing his opponent, Ghazala Hashmi, of once calling on Mr. Northam to resign, until he donated $25,000 to her, “buying her silence.” Despite the attack, Ms. Hashmi crushed Mr. Sturtevant in Richmond precincts with many black voters, the key to her upset victory. “The liberal groups that should have continued to put pressure on Governor Northam for this scandal made the political calculation that it was better for their self-interest to shut up about it,” said Will Ritter, a Republican strategist in the state. Whatever doubts that lingered with Democratic voters about state leadership were largely banished in the summer, when the governor called the Legislature back to Richmond to pass gun restrictions after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31. The Republican majorities adjourned the session after 90 minutes, a bit of political drama that stuck with many voters in November. “The calling of the special session turned out to be brilliant,” said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in the state. “Republicans couldn’t bring themselves to go against their rural base to make changes. This put a totally different dynamic on the election.” Mr. Northam said the eight bills he introduced in the aborted session would be the first ones out of the gate when the new General Assembly majorities meet in January. They include universal background checks, a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, limiting handgun purchases to one a month and a so-called red flag law to let a court remove weapons from people who pose a threat. He has not ruled out confiscating assault weapons from gun owners. Mr. Northam, who has treated gunshot victims as a pediatric neurologist and an Army medical officer, said he had hoped for bipartisanship from Republicans when he called a special session. “I said I want to dialogue. I want votes and laws,” he said. “They had an opportunity to have that dialogue and they chose not to, and I think they paid that price on Tuesday.” All year, Mr. Northam has retained the support of black voters. Even as his overall approval plunged to 40 percent two months after the yearbook photo surfaced, 63 percent of African-American voters wanted him to remain in office, according to a poll by Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Va. The same pollster found in an October survey that Mr. Northam’s overall approval had recovered, to 51 percent. Defying calls to resign by the Democratic caucuses in the House of Delegates and State Senate in February, the governor vowed to dedicate the rest of his term to fighting racial inequity. His effort won support from black lawmakers. He created a commission to comb Virginia’s laws for legacies of Jim Crow, and a second commission to review school textbooks for fair coverage of black history. Last week, the governor included two historically black colleges in $1 billion of funding to graduate more computer science majors from the state’s universities. Lamont Bagby, a member of the state’s House of Delegates and chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus, said the majority of caucus members were graduates of H.B.C.U.s, and ensuring more state support was a priority. “February put the issues that have been important to the black caucus for decades on the front burner,” Mr. Bagby said, expressing his support for Mr. Northam. (Back in February, the Legislative Black Caucus had called on the governor to resign.) Looking ahead, Mr. Bagby said black lawmakers want to see laws aimed at preventing evictions and increasing affordable housing. He added: “There is no reason why we can’t finally have a discussion on monuments.” Mr. Northam said he supports overturning a century-old law that would clear the way to let local governments decide the fate of Civil War statues. Modesty is not a quality in demand in modern American politics, either from voters or officeholders. But Mr. Northam’s level of self-effacement may have been what helped him survive. “The election on Tuesday was about Virginia,” he said. In other words, not Ralph Northam.

133,https://slate.com/technology/2019/11/8chan-8kun-white-supremacists-telegram-discord-facebook.html?via=rss,"8chan went offline in August after the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. An hour before the alleged shooter killed 22 people, he apparently posted a racist, anti-immigrant screed on 8chan and wrote, “Do your part and spread this brothers!” It was the third instance this year that a shooter had posted a manifesto to 8chan, but this time, the anonymous image board—a haven for conspiracy theories and bigotry—faced blowback from its service providers, including Cloudflare, which the site used for security, and Tucows, its domain host. Both dropped 8chan—which is owned by Americans but is based in the Philippines—as a client. On Nov. 2, 8chan came back online with a new name and new service providers. It’s called 8kun, and it’s run by the same owner, Jim Watkins. But while the users who made 8chan what it was were certainly hampered by the site’s deplatforming, they didn’t disappear when the site went down. They found other ways to congregate. 8chan and the new 8kun look identical, but they’re not. 8kun is currently only reliably accessible on the dark web, meaning that to reach it you need software like Tor, which allows users to browse the web anonymously and reach unindexed websites. It’s not hard to download the Tor browser, but it’s still an extra step that makes 8kun harder to find and likely to have fewer visitors than its predecessor, which had millions of users. Another main difference: 8kun doesn’t have a “/pol/” board (short for “politically incorrect”). That corner of 8chan—named after a board on its forerunner, 4chan—was where trolls gathered to discuss politics and plan harassment and doxing campaigns against people they disagreed with, like activists and journalists. It’s also where the alleged perpetrators of the El Paso and Christchurch, New Zealand, massacres—as well as a shooter in Poway, California—posted their manifestos before opening fire. There’s no /pol/ now, but there is Q, the mysterious online figure at the center of the stubbornly persistent QAnon conspiracy theory. Missives from Q were posted on 8chan before believers in the theory spread them over other social networks. The wide-ranging QAnon theory posits, among other things, that the Mueller investigation was really an effort for President Donald Trump to arrest a vast Democratic pedophile ring. When 8chan went down, Q’s “breadcrumbs” stopped too. That’s because the way Q has been able to maintain anonymity and still assure its followers that the clues it drops are consistently from the same source was that Q always posted on 8chan using the same anonymizing “tripcode,” which is similar to a unique password but rather is a username that only one poster can have. Without 8chan and the tripcode with which Q posted, Q had no method of proving that its messages were coming from the same Q who had been posting all along. “When 8kun launched, I went to the Q research board, and Q posted within about six hours of the new site launching,” says Alex Kaplan, a disinformation researcher from the left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America. Watkins appears to be a supporter of the conspiracy theory. When he testified to Congress in September, he wore a Q pin. Fredrick Brennan—who founded 8chan but handed the keys over to Watson in 2016 and is now a vocal critic of the website—alleged in a tweet last week that “the point of 8kun is Q, full stop. Every other board migrated is just for show.” It’s possible Q had nowhere else to go. But the community of white-nationalist trolls that gathered on 8chan for years did. 8chan was originally created to be even less restrained than 4chan, itself an incubator of harassment campaigns and a forum for hate, including white supremacy. But 4chan, which was founded in 2003, does have some rules. When the site’s owners decided to ban some threads about the Gamergate harassment campaign in 2014, Brennan started 8chan as a site where anything, no matter how vile, would be allowed to stay up. That included a lot of discussion of white supremacy, white nationalism, and the formation of a white ethno-state. This was the community to which the alleged El Paso shooter directed his manifesto, saying he was inspired by the playbook used by the perpetrator of the mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was the community to which the Christchurch shooter addressed a sprawling, white supremacist essay and with which he shared a Facebook Live broadcast of the massacre. It’s the community that told the Poway shooter to “get the high score” and try to kill even more people than the Christchurch shooter. (He killed one woman.) When 8chan was deplatformed, and /pol/ went with it, this community was able to find new homes. If you were a dedicated and hateful-enough user of online forums to find your way to a place like 8chan’s /pol/ board, you could handle being kicked off a platform and find your old friends. Many of 8chan users flocked to Discord, the chat app for gamers that’s also become a popular tool for hate groups to organize, chat, and indoctrinate new followers. They shared links and invited interlocutors to join other groups across the internet, including on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app that also has public social pages and where a thriving community of thousands of 8chan and 4chan /pol/ members now connect to exchange racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and anti-Semitic content throughout the day. One 4chan /pol/ board on Telegram has more than 5,000 members. “WhiteIsRight,” another Telegram channel popular among displaced 8chaners, has more than 6,300 members. “With the communities that develop in an anonymous message board, they’re using Facebook, they’re using Twitter, they’re using everything else,” said Brian Friedberg, a senior researcher at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard University who studies hate and disinformation online. Some 8chan /pol/ members also migrated to new online boards and forums that fit more specifically with their ideological leanings, like NeinChan, which attracts a particularly anti-Semitic crowd, according to Friedberg. There’s also JulayWorld, which has a small fascist board that has attracted some former 8channers. Before going offline, 8chan also hosted what disinformation researchers like Friedberg sometimes call “dark libraries,” archives of PDFs and videos about Nazism and racist pseudoscience that are used to convert curious new entrants into ideologies of hate. Those libraries have since moved to Telegram, where there are many channels that appear to have been created for the purpose of hosting this material. (For example, one is called “Redpill Quotes and References,” and another is called “Redpilled Politics.”) The difference is that having a static page on 8chan is far easier to share than a link to a Telegram channel, which is best browsed in a specific app and structured like a chat thread, so certain links can be hard to resurface when new ones are added. While many former 8channers were probably hoping the original site would come back in some form, Friedberg says that there’s a newer generation of fringe-right internet users who are starting to see the anonymous message boards like the /pol/ sections of 8chan and 4chan as outdated. “Their identities are not as invested in these anonymous communities in the same way that I think the lead-up to the last alt-right was,” Friedberg said. “I feel like even on 4chan people say that the era of the pols is almost something of the past now. The new generation is moving both because they’re afraid of surveillance [of the chans] and because the memes that they were trying to get are so deeply embedded in so many cultural conversations.” It’s not hard to find memes on Instagram, for example, parroting the 13-50 meme, a white supremacist myth. There are dozens of pages on Facebook about white pride. Some of these users want less sunlight now that the chans are so notorious. And others don’t mind operating right out in the open. Take a feud currently underway between Charlie Kirk, the leader of right-wing student group Turning Point USA, and the YouTuber, podcaster, and white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Over the past two months, an online flame war between the two men has moved offline, as Fuentes has urged his followers, who call themselves Groypers—named for Groyper, a more racist version of the Pepe the Frog meme—to show up at Turning Point USA events and troll Kirk onstage. At a recent event at Ohio State University called where Kirk was onstage speaking, Fuentes’ fans stood up to ask questions during the Q&A session. “How does anal sex help us win the culture war?” one of the trolls in the audience asked, wearing a suit, perfectly comfortable with being filmed making these homophobic remarks. 8chan has been offline for months, but the 8chan set hasn’t. The new 8kun might never have a /pol/ board like its previous incarnation did. But there’s still Discord and Telegram and other private chat apps for those who like to lurk behind screen names in forums. And two years after the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, there are still plenty of people willing to wear their racism and xenophobia proudly. The deplatforming of 8chan certainly took away one of the easiest to find, most popular watering holes for the hateful and hate-curious. What’s worrying three months later is that many of the online racists who used 8chan appear not to need it anymore. Correction, Nov. 20, 2019: This article originally misstated that Discord and Telegram don’t have rules. Although the platforms have been criticized for not always enforcing their rules, they do have terms of service and employ workers to enforce them. Future Tense

134,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/nov/12/school-shooting-suspension-surveillance-students,"An offhand statement got me reported to officials. The ensuing process didn’t seem designed to keep anyone safe Last modified on Wed 13 Nov 2019 00.35 GMT At 13, I was suspended from middle school for a week because school administrators were worried I might start shooting people. It’s a story that often surprises and amuses friends now - my violent side is limited to hitting people on the roller derby track.  I wasn’t a safety risk to my fellow students when I was 13. I was a severely depressed teenager trying to stand up to bullying who got caught in the zero-tolerance policies so common in American schools in the years after the mass shooting at Columbine high school. My suspension came on the heels of a rough year. I’d spent much of it feeling isolated and trapped in my own head, unable to reconcile what I now recognize as severe depression with my high grades and expectations of success. I traded my jeans in for a Hot Topic-inspired black ensemble, discovered progressive metal bands like Sonata Arctica and Blind Guardian, and began cutting myself in an effort to feel less numb. I also started reading about macabre topics – Ebola outbreaks, ecological disasters and school shootings. I sought out darkness in the world around me because I desperately needed to understand the darkness in my own head. As I tried to understand what led to the Columbine shooting, I was struck by the then accepted narrative (now largely debunked): two boys, bullied mercilessly by their classmates, eventually snapped and turned to violence. It seemed almost a parable for the problems I saw at school and in the world. Our culture’s willingness to write the shooters off as irredeemably evil seemed to me an easy way to avoid looking at deeper problems like teenage isolation and bullying, and I said as much to anyone who would listen. By the spring, my depression was becoming less all-consuming, perhaps because I’d learned to live with it (as I’ve done into adulthood), and perhaps because I’d been blessed with good friends who stuck with me through some of the worst moments of my life. But my desire to create change hadn’t diminished, and neither had my interest in some darker topics. An unremarkable bus ride provided the tipping point for school administrators. I had a usual group of classmates I talked to, one of whom was a regular target for bullies. A classmate called him a faggot on the bus, and I told the boy to stop. This exchange wasn’t unusual, but this time, the bully challenged me: why should I? Having exhausted my regular reasons – “it’s the right thing to do” – I turned to Columbine. “Look at what happens when you bully people,” I told him. “Do you want that to happen here?” Amid the early-2000s paranoia about teen violence, it’s not surprising that that statement caused concern or that a student thought to report it to school administrators. That fear has only grown in the years since, and with it suggestions from lawmakers and administrators to improve risk assessments and in some cases surveil teens’ private communications. But what followed for me was a process that didn’t seem designed to keep anyone safe. I couldn’t say whether my suspension began days or weeks later; the bus conversation was so unremarkable that I’d forgotten it by the time we arrived at school. On a Monday afternoon, my parents received a phone call saying they needed to meet with school administrators the following morning. I didn’t learn I was barred from school pending a district risk assessment until they walked out of the building, and the minutes I spent sitting alone in their car in the school parking lot felt like an eternity. No one bothered to ask if I had access to a gun (I’d never held one and, growing up in the middle of Seattle, didn’t know a single adult who owned one), had a specific target in mind or a plan to hurt anyone. As a reporter who now covers local schools, I know those are central questions in evaluating how serious a suspected threat really is. Perhaps more damning, the decision was made by two administrators I’d never spoken to. They didn’t consult the teachers who interacted with me on a daily basis or any other adults or peers who knew me. As the risk assessment process unfolded, some of the most painful moments of my life came under a microscope. My school counselor shared with the risk assessment team that I’d harmed myself and had suicidal thoughts earlier in the year, something which my school’s decision-makers apparently felt put me at greater risk for hurting others, because I’d shown I was capable of violence. I struggled deciding how honest to be in the pages of psychological evaluation forms I had to fill out, assuming anything perceived as abnormal would be used as grounds to keep me away from my friends. It felt as if no one was interested in getting me help, nor did anyone appear concerned that a teenager struggling with depression might be more likely to take her own life after nearly a week of being cut off from social interaction and left at the mercy of a swirling rumor mill at school. When I was finally cleared to return to school four days later, I was relieved and grateful for the friends, teachers and my parents who had stepped in on my behalf. A required meeting with the principal made me late to my first class, and the resulting scene was out of a movie. Students were getting ready for an all-day class field trip, and when I walked in the door, someone yelled, “Rachel’s back!” Some of my classmates applauded. I spent the day playing games outside with friends and satisfying their morbid curiosity about what Seattle public schools’ psychological evaluations looked like. I was lucky that my suspension played out without massive social consequences. It showed me I had many friends and adults who would stand by me. But it also reinforced that much of that support was conditional on me being “normal”, a realization which did little to help me manage depression as a young teen. I had solidified a belief that can be deadly for mentally ill young people: counselors and adult authority figures aren’t there to help, and speaking honestly about your struggles or problems at school will only get you in trouble. I shudder now to think how the process might have played out had I not been a well-off white student with two supportive parents who were able to attend meeting after meeting to advocate for me. The leniency regularly granted to white students like me over our black peers was visible daily in the halls of the diverse urban schools I attended, and is clearly visible in data about suspension and expulsion in nearly every school district in America. Zero tolerance is less en vogue now, but with school shootings a regular topic of discussion, there’s renewed interest in monitoring what kids are saying in private and their mental illnesses as a preventive measure. Lost in that discussion is how crucial trust and connection are for teens still figuring out their place in an increasingly polarized and complicated world. If teens don’t feel they can speak honestly about their struggles without triggering an investigation, they won’t ask adults for help when they truly need it – and that’s far more deadly.",2019-11-12 06:00:22,Panic over school shootings got me suspended at 13.

135,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/12/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-white-nationalist-agenda-breitbart,"Emails to former Breitbart writer show Miller focused on inserting white nationalist talking points to shape 2016 election coverage Last modified on Wed 6 Jan 2021 23.57 GMT Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller shaped the 2016 election coverage of the hard right-wing website Breitbart with material drawn from prominent white nationalists, Islamophobes, and far-right websites, according to a new investigative report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). Miller also railed against those wishing to remove Confederate monuments and flags from public display in the wake of Dylann Roof’s murderous 2015 attack on a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and praised America’s early 20th-century race-based, restrictionist immigration policies.  Emails from Miller to a former Breitbart writer, sent before and after he joined the Trump campaign, show Miller obsessively focused on injecting white nationalist-style talking points on race and crime, Confederate monuments, and Islam into the far-right website’s campaign coverage, the SPLC report says. Miller, one of the few surviving initial appointees in the administration, has been credited with orchestrating Trump’s restrictionist immigration policies. The SPLC story is based largely on emails provided by a former Breitbart writer, Katie McHugh. McHugh was fired by Breitbart over a series of anti-Muslim tweets and has since renounced the far right, telling the SPLC that the movement is “evil”. However, throughout 2015 and 2016, as the Trump campaign progressed and she became an increasingly influential voice at Breitbart, McHugh told the SPLC that Miller urged her in a steady drumbeat of emails and phone calls to promote arguments from sources popular with far-right and white nationalist movements. Miller’s emails had a “strikingly narrow” focus on race and immigration, according to the SPLC report. At various times, the SPLC reports, Miller recommendations for McHugh included the white nationalist website, VDare; Camp of the Saints, a racist novel focused on a “replacement” of European whites by mass third-world immigration; conspiracy site Infowars; and Refugee Resettlement Watch, a fringe anti-immigrant site whose tagline is “They are changing America by changing the people”. McHugh also says that in a phone call, Miller suggested that she promote an analysis of race and crime featured on the website of a white nationalist organization, American Renaissance. The American Renaissance article he mentioned was the subject of significant interest on the far right in 2015. In the two weeks following the murder of nine people at a church in Charleston by the white supremacist Dylann Roof as Americans demanded the removal of Confederate statues and flags, Miller encouraged McHugh to turn the narrative back on leftists and Latinos. “Should the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest?” he asked in one email on 24 June. “When will the left be made to apologize for the blood on their hands supporting every commie regime since Stalin?” he asked in another the following day. When another mass shooting happened in Oregon in October 2015, Miller wrote that the killer, Chris Harper-Mercer “is described as ‘mixed race’ and born in England. Any chance of piecing that profile together more, or will it all be covered up?” Miller repeatedly brings up President Calvin Coolidge, who is revered among white nationalists for signing the 1924 Immigration Act which included racial quotas for immigration. In one email, Miller remarks on a report about the beginning of Immigrant Heritage Month by writing: “This would seem a good opportunity to remind people about the heritage established by Calvin Coolidge, which covers four decades of the 20th century.” The four decades in question is the period between the passage of the Immigration Act and the abolition of racial quotas. Miller also hints at conspiratorial explanations for the maintenance of current immigration policies. Mainstream coverage of the 50th anniversary of the removal of racial quotas in immigration policy had lacked detail, Miller believed, because “Elites can’t allow the people to see that their condition is not the product of events beyond their control, but the product of policy they foisted onto them.”. Miller used a US government email address during the early part of the correspondence, when he was an aide to senator Jeff Sessions, and then announced his new job on the Trump campaign, and a new email address, to recipients including McHugh. As well as McHugh, recipients of his emails included others then at Breitbart who subsequently worked in the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon and current Trump aide, Julia Hahn.",2019-11-12 10:30:44,Trump adviser Stephen Miller injected white nationalist agenda into Breitbart – report,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

The Supreme Court offered no explanation for why it wouldn’t entertain the gunmaker’s appeal. The decision was announced on Tuesday. Remington had filed an appeal with the Supreme Court after Connecticut’s Supreme Court ruled in March the Sandy Hook lawsuit — which was first filed in 2014, a little more than three years after the 2012 mass shooting that killed 26 people, including 20 first-graders — could move forward. That ruling overturned a Connecticut superior court’s decision that would have ended the lawsuit. Tuesday’s decision means the civil case will now proceed in Connecticut, but it is unclear when court proceedings will formally begin in that state. RELATED: Tragedy in Newtown: Remember Forever In December of 2012, Adam Lanza went on a shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 20 students and six educators before turning the gun on himself. Lanza also shot and killed his mother in their home earlier that morning. Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

The civil suit alleges that Remington has negligently sold military-grade firearms to civilians. But the gun manufacturer maintains a 2005 federal law shields them from such litigation. RELATED: Return to Newtown: How the Sandy Hook Victims Live on in the Hearts and Work of Their Families “The families are grateful that the Supreme Court upheld precedent and denied Remington’s latest attempt to avoid accountability,” Josh Koskoff, the attorney representing the families, said in a statement obtained by NBC News in Connecticut. It concludes: “We are ready to resume discovery and proceed toward trial in order to shed light on Remington’s profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users at the expense of Americans’ safety.” A spokesperson for the gunmaker was unavailable at press time.

But – bless them – they continue to honor those who were lost by trying to protect the rest of us from their kind of sorrow and loss. On Tuesday the Supreme Court allowed to go forward a lawsuit the families filed against the Remington Arms Co. This must have been a surprise and a shock for the Republican members of Congress who have for years been in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. I’m sure the GOP majority thought they’d protected gun makers against being held liable for selling the human hunting rifles that are used in America’s innumerable mass shootings. In this instance, however, the court is allowing the suit to go forward. The families of those shot by then-20-year-old Adam Lanza at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 believe that the manufacturer of the AR-15 rifle used in the rampage should be held accountable. They filed a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer, along with the distributor and seller of the rifle. In the lawsuit, they call the AR-15 a ""military weapon"" with ""little utility for legitimate civilian purposes."" Looking for the other side of the story? Subscribe today for access to even more opinions. According to the lawsuit, ""In order to continue profiting from the sale of AR-15s, defendants chose to disregard the unreasonable risks the rifle posed outside of specialized, highly regulated institutions like the armed forces and law enforcement. Plaintiffs seek nothing more and nothing less than accountability for the consequences of that choice."" Maybe, finally, they’ll get it. At least from the gun makers. It’s too bad they cannot also sue Congress. Each time there is a mass shooting in the United States there is a call for our lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to do something about the proliferation of weapons of war in civilian hands. And each time that call is ignored, or any measures offered are blocked by Republicans. There are plenty of ways to protect citizens while protecting Second Amendment rights. I will never understand how members of Congress can look at a photograph of one of the children killed in Newtown, or listen to one of those grieving parents talk about the loss, and not at least try to do something.

141,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/12/report-trump-aide-miller-promoted-racist-propaganda-in-emails/,"Trending: [vemba-video id=”politics/2018/01/23/stephen-miller-immigration-views-kaye-pkg.cnn”] Associated Press MONTGOMERY, Ala. — White House adviser Stephen Miller sent emails that “promoted white nationalist literature and racist propaganda” to conservative news site Breitbart, the Southern Poverty Law Center said Tuesday after releasing excerpts. The nonprofit’s Hatewatch blog published portions of emails that Miller sent to Breitbart editors in 2015 and 2016, the majority from he was working for then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions but before he joined Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. The SPLC said it reviewed about 900 email exchanges, in which Miller often discusses immigration stories, provided by former Breitbart editor Katie McHugh, who was fired in 2017. In one excerpt, Miller suggested a dystopian novel popular among the far right about violent migrants who invaded France while discussing the pope’s immigration message: “Also, you see the Pope saying west must, in effect, get rid of borders. Someone should point out the parallels to ‘Camp of the Saints.'” Another email appears to show Miller discussing potential articles after retailer Amazon began discussing pulling Confederate flags after a 2015 mass shooting targeting African Americans killed nine at a South Carolina church. Shooter Dylann Roof, an avowed white nationalist, had posed for photos with the battle flag. “Have you thought about going to Amazon and finding the commie flags and then doing a story on that?” Miller wrote, according to the published emails. While responding to a question about whether a hurricane would drive migration from Mexico, Miller wrote that it “100 percent” would and migrants would receive temporary protected status, or TPS. “That needs to be the weekend’s BIG story. TPS is everything,” Miller wrote. Miller then sent a link from VDARE, an anti-immigration website that has published work by white nationalists. The article focused on instances in which the United States offered refugees temporary protected status, the SPLC said. VDARE founder Peter Brimelow has denied that his website is white nationalist but acknowledged it publishes works by writers who fit that description “in the sense that they aim to defend the interests of American whites.” “Americans should be terrified by the casual way that Stephen Miller, who has enormous influence in the White House, shares racist content and speaks the language of white nationalists in emails to people he apparently considered fellow travelers,” Michael Edison Hayden of Hatewatch said in a news release.

Hatewatch wrote that it was unable to find any examples of Miller “writing sympathetically or even in neutral tones about any person who is nonwhite or foreign-born.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said officials had not seen the report but lashed out at the Southern Poverty Law Center’s credibility. “They libel, slander, and defame conservatives for a living. They are beneath public discussion,” Grisham said. Miller worked for Sessions, who was a Senate hardliner on immigration before becoming Trump’s first attorney general.

(Photo by OnScene.TV)   Over the years, there hasn’t been a lot of research on whether monetary rewards are successful, but a Chicago-based criminologist has spent a lot of time trying to figure out if they are. “From a scientific standpoint, there is no solid evidence that offering a reward increases the overall likelihood that a crime will be solved,” said Arthur Lurigio, a professor at Loyola University Chicago. “My common sense and intuition – put aside my being a scientist and psychologist – I would think, ‘Of course that should make a difference,’ because you’re providing a financial motivation.” But there are a lot of factors when people consider approaching police, including if the suspect is a relative or they otherwise know him or her – or perhaps they have been partners in crime. “If people were going to report to the police and felt safe enough to report it,” Lurigio said, “they probably would’ve, otherwise I don’t know if the money could be the tipping point for them.” Then again, there isn’t a lot to lose in offering a reward. “It’s the community’s way of expressing their outrage,” Lurigio said. At first rub, having a lot of witnesses seems like a real good thing: There were 25 to 30 people attending the joint birthday and Halloween party that night in Long Beach. But solving cases evolving from a violent party can breed problems. “In any shocking event, many things can affect eyewitness memory,” said Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist at University of California, Irvine and an expert on memory. “But when you have people who are intoxicated, it adds an additional level of concern. Alcohol affects the formation of new memories. People can form poor memories while they’re intoxicated.” In April 2015, Ruben Sosa, 27, was at a house party in Oakley in Northern California when he was shot and killed during a large fight outside the home. There were dozens of eyewitnesses, but no one has been charged yet in Sosa’s killing. About 35 miles away in Orinda, at least one gunman killed five this past Halloween evening as 100 others were about at a party in a rented mansion. Police have not announced an arrest so far. “Well, obviously there’s the issue that it was Halloween and people are going to be in (costumes) and alter their appearance,” Qiana Washington, a defense attorney based in Walnut Creek, said about that case. “If people are intoxicated, that’s going to impair their memories. … “And then, when you have shootings happening, people are going to focus on survival,” Washington said. “They’re not going to be studying who’s shooting; they’re just going to be trying to protect themselves.” Police asked that anyone with information on the Rose Park shooting call them at 562-570-7244 or anonymously leave a tip with Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) or by texting “TIPLA” plus a message to 274637.

        Ellie Hall Posted on November 12, 2019, at 10:21 p.m. ET A makeshift memorial for victims of the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 people dead. The number of violent hate crimes reported in the United States last year was the highest in 16 years, according to the FBI — but advocacy groups warned that the actual figure is much higher than the official count reported Tuesday.The Department of Justice defines a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property, motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.”Data released Tuesday by the FBI shows that although the total number of reported hate crimes in the United States decreased from 2017 to 2018, the number of offenses against people increased by 12%. Of the 7,120 hate crimes reported to the FBI in 2018, 4,571 were crimes against persons (such as assault, rape, and murder).Most of the hate crimes — about 60% — were motivated by race, ethnicity, or ancestry bias. The other motivations included religion (19%), sexual orientation (17%), gender identity (2%), disability (2%), and gender (1%).In particular, attacks against Latinos and transgender people saw a significant increase in 2018, with 485 crimes determined to be anti-Latino — 58 more than in 2017. Since 2016, the number of crimes targeting Latinos has soared by 41%. “We’re saddened but not shocked that the number of violent hate crimes against Hispanics has increased,” Janet Murguía, president and CEO of the nation's largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, UnidosUS, told BuzzFeed News.“President Trump frequently refers to Latinos in the most hateful and bigoted ways, and words matter,” Murguía said. “Hateful words have hateful consequences, and can result in violence and even death.”Murguía cited the August mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, which left 22 people dead in what police said was a targeted attack on Mexicans, as an example of these “hateful consequences.”""President Trump should be aware that in the community’s mind, he bears some responsibility for the increase in hate crimes against Latinos,"" she said. The FBI reported 142 hate crimes against transgender people in 2018, an increase of 34% from the year before. LGBTQ activists who spoke with BuzzFeed News said that the Trump administration’s rhetoric and proposed policies against the community likely influenced these rising numbers.“As our culture grows more and more divisive, fueled largely by an anti-LGBTQ White House, a permission slip has been given for some Americans to act on their worst instincts and to target others,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD.“This report should sound an alarm that we all must do better to create a country where marginalized communities are safe and protected against hate violence. Violent hate crimes against LGBTQ people are a pervasive issue that needs to be addressed by politicians and law enforcement in a bipartisan and urgent way.”GLAAD was one of several advocacy groups that used the study's release on Tuesday to call for strong legislative action to combat and track hate crimes.The FBI's annual report is based on hate crime data collected from law enforcement agencies around the country, but experts and advocacy groups say that many, if not most, are not counted. The New York Times found that 87% of the 16,039 law enforcement agencies that submitted data to the FBI in 2018 reported that there were no hate crimes in their jurisdiction that year.A 2017 federal Bureau of Justice Statistics study reported that Americans experience an average of 250,000 hate crime victimizations each year, far more than the 7,120 reported by the FBI.A bill in the House of Representatives called the ""Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality (No Hate) Act"" — named in honor of two victims of hate crimes that weren't reported as such to the FBI — would mandate new action to obtain more accurate numbers, such as training officers to recognize hate crimes and setting up reporting hotlines. ""At the end of the day, this data simply isn’t giving us the accurate information we need to effectively counteract hate against targeted communities,” said Sim J. Singh, of the Sikh Coalition in a statement Tuesday. According to the FBI, anti-Sikh hate crimes skyrocketed 200% from 2017 to 2018. A memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after a shooting in October 2018 left 11 people dead. ""It’s past time for action. Congress must pass the next generation of common-sense legislation that equips law enforcement to better identify and track hate incidents,"" Singh said. The National Disability Rights Network also issued a statement in support of the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act on Tuesday. According to the FBI, people with disabilities experienced 159 attacks in 2018, a 37% increase over the previous year. ""People with disabilities are often the first victims of extremists and their hate-filled vision of society,"" said Curt Decker, the group's executive director. ""NDRN will continue to work with the many civil rights groups who share our values of community and inclusion for all until hatred, bigotry, and racism are extinguished for good."" Eleven of the 24 hate crime killings reported to the FBI in 2018 were victims of the same attack — a mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, 2018. Sixty percent of all reported religious-based hate crimes from that year were directed against Jews. “It is unacceptable that Jews and Jewish institutions continue to be at the center of religion-based hate crime attacks,” Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement Tuesday, urging Congress to take ""concrete action"" and pass the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act. ""By improving hate crime training, prevention, best practices, and data collection, we can stem hate crimes nationwide,"" Greenblatt said. ""Our nation cannot address crimes that we are not measuring."" Ellie Hall is a senior reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC. Contact Ellie Hall at ellie.hall@buzzfeed.com.

145,https://gizmodo.com/stephen-miller-linked-to-white-supremacist-sites-pushe-1839815452,"Donald Trump’s senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, the immigration ultra-hardliner behind this White House’s nastiest efforts to villify and torment immigrants and refugees, pushed racist talking points and linked to white supremacist websites in leaked emails published on Tuesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The emails are between Miller and Katie McHugh, a former editor for far-right website Breitbart who was involved in the white nationalist movement, but was later fired from the publication over Islamophobic tweets. McHugh has since publicly renounced racism and the modern far-right hate movement. According to the SPLC, Breitbart editors introduced McHugh (then still at Breitbart) to Miller in the lead-up to the 2016 elections “with an understanding he would influence the direction of her reporting”; the emails largely concern Miller’s attempts to steer the course of McHugh’s writing as well as pitch story ideas. The tone of the discussions clearly shows Miller considered McHugh a fellow traveler in the far-right movement, freely letting loose with thoughts that many would associate with pointy hoods. McHugh told the SPLC that in July 2015, Miller called her on the phone and suggested she read an article on “AmRen”—referring to American Renaissance, the openly white supremacist publication operated by racist activist Jared Taylor. The article in question, written by Taylor and titled “New DOJ Statistics on Race and Violent Crime,” praised the Department of Justice for releasing crime statistics broken down to separately denote those attributed to Hispanics rather than “rather than lumping them in with whites.” McHugh’s recounting of the conversation was backed by emails showing that after McHugh sent Miller a National Review article citing the crime stats, Miller requested that she contact him via phone to discuss “immigrant crime.” In subsequent emails months later, Miller returned to the subject: Miller, Sept. 1, 2015, 2:38 p.m. ET: “Hey Katie, Hope all is well. Was curious to see if you were still planning a story with the DOJ crime victims’ data.” McHugh, Sept. 1, 2015, 2:56 p.m. ET: “Hi Stephen, yes, I’d like to. Can we touch base tomorrow morning/early afternoon after I write a couple of assignments?” Miller, Sept. 1, 2015, 3:10 p.m. ET: “Absolutely” Another email chain in September 2015 focused on The Camp of the Saints, a wildly racist French novel idolized by white supremacists set in a world where hordes of immigrants and refugees overrun the West. Miller kicked off the thread on Sept. 1, addressing U.S. immigration policy as tantamount to “being invaded and talked into tolerating it,” adding that immigration is “treated as organic. No mention of voluntary policy which can be shut off.” On Sept. 5, Miller followed up with a link to a tweet from Republican pundit David Frum asserting that half of all violent crime in Germany is “committed by ‘foreign youths,’” as well as linked McHugh to a Vox.com article suggesting that SAT scores are being driven down by increased representation of “poor and nonwhite students.” McHugh said that Breitbart was considering a “series” of articles on the latter topic, to which Miller responded: On the education angle? Makes sense. Also, you see the Pope saying west must, in effect, get rid of borders. Someone should point out the parallels to Camp of the Saints. Per the SPLC, fellow Breitbart reporter Julia Hahn indeed penned an article related to the book that month; she is now a Trump aide. In another email from Oct. 23, 2015, McHugh discussed the aftermath of Hurricane Patricia with Miller, asking whether it could drive “mass migration” into the U.S. from affected parts of Central America and Mexico and if any refugees could receive temporary protected status (TPS) allowing them to remain in the states for a period of time. Miller responded, “100 percent. And they will all get TPS. And all the ones here will get TPS too. That needs to be the weekend’s BIG story. TPS is everything.” He then followed up by sending McHugh a link to VDARE, a virulently anti-immigrant hate site operated by self-described “racial realist” Peter Brimelow, who is often described by others as a white supremacist. Miller and McHugh also discussed efforts to remove Confederate symbols throughout the nation following the June 2015 massacre of nine black churchgoers in Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina by white supremacist Dylan Roof. On June 23, Miller wrote an email with the subject line “defies modern comprehension,” referring to retailers removing the Confederate flag from their stores, and cited statistics about the number of Southern men who died during the American Civil War. McHugh says she took a phone call on the matter with Miller, after which he replied via email with suggestions to run counter-coverage attacking Amazon for selling “commie flags,” calling it a “potentially profound” examination of the “stunning corporate hypocrisy that defines our modern culture.” McHugh wrote the piece. In response, Miller ranted about how taking down monuments to the Confederacy was disrespectful to the U.S. military and the supposed hypocrisy of people of Latin American descent who display Spanish flags or Christian crosses, as well as demanded “the left” apologize for communism: Miller, June 23, 2015, 10:34 p.m. ET: “what do the [Confederate monument] vandals say to the people fighting and dying overseas in uniform right now who are carrying on a seventh or eighth generation of military service in their families, stretching back to our founding?” Miller, June 24, 2015, 2:07 p.m. ET: “1. Should people of Spanish descent, especially those living in immigrant communities, be banned from displaying the Spanish flag given Spanish conduct in Latin America? 2. Should [Univision anchor] Jorge Ramos apologize for Spanish conduct in Latin America, and redress it by ensuring more people of indigenous backgrounds have hosting duties on his network? 3. Should the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest?” Miller, June 25, 2015, 10:38 a.m. ET: “When will the left be made to apologize for the blood on their hands supporting every commie regime since stalin?” Finally, in another thread in October 2015, Miller responded to news of a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, by fixating on the “mixed race” background of gunman Chris Harper-Mercer. Miller suggested that some kind of conspiracy was at play, presumably with the intent of covering up that the shooter was not white: Miller, Oct. 2, 2015, 12:06 a.m. ET: “[Harper-Mercer] is described as ‘mixed race’ and born in England. Any chance of piecing that profile together more, or will it all be covered up?” The next day, news outlets reported that Harper-Mercer had white supremacist leanings. There is, of course, no evidence that the media “covered up” his identity. Other emails show Miller claimed to have met with anti-Islam extremist Pamela Geller, cited InfoWars stories on a far-right pastor’s calls for an end to Muslim immigration, and repeatedly praised late president Calvin Coolidge for imposing the eugenicist Immigration Act of 1924. One major fan of that law was Adolf Hitler, who wrote in Mein Kampf that Germany should impose similar laws. Miller also regularly wrote using terms that would immediately raise red flags among anyone familiar with white supremacist ideology, the SPLC reported, including by mockingly referring to diversity as the U.S.’s “national religion.” “What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration,” McHugh told the SPLC. Similarly to how Miller railed about TPS status being granted to refugees fleeing devastation after Hurricane Patricia, the White House denied TPS to mostly black Bahamian refugees whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Dorian this year. Miller has also been widely cited as the architect of the Trump administration’s reviled migrant family separation policy, which could best be described as a campaign of intentional cruelty justified as deterrence, as well as its efforts to ban migration from Muslim-majority countries. As the SPLC noted, in 2005, American Renaissance republished an article of Miller’s that had first appeared in right-wing site FrontPage Magazine titled “Santa Monica High’s Multicultural Fistfights.” In that article, Miller wrote that U.S. schools were “excusing black and Hispanic misbehavior by holding those students to a lower standard.” Miller did not respond to the SPLC when asked about how and why American Renaissance republished the piece. Miller remains one of the chaotic administration’s longest-tenured staffers and continues to wield enormous influence over its immigration policies. The White House has largely responded to the emails in the SPLC piece by going on an incoherent attack run,  implying that the organization might have just made the whole thing up and outright stating behind the cover of anonymity that the suggestion Miller (who is Jewish) harbors far-right ties is somehow inherently anti-Semitic. “We have not seen the report,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Axios in a statement. “The SPLC, however, is an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization that has recently been forced—to its great humiliation—to issue a major retraction for other wholly-fabricated accusations. They libel, slander, and defame conservatives for a living. They are beneath public discussion.” Another White House staffer, who refused to be quoted by name, told Axios reporter Zach Basu “This is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against a Jewish staffer.” (According to CNN, hours later, Grisham was still professing ignorance as to the contents of the SPLC report.) While Miller’s role in some of the White House’s most egregious abuses was already well known, and he has earned a reputation as at the very least sympathetic to white supremacist ideology, the leaked emails could see him join the long list of disgraced figures exiting the Trump administration. However, the president has loudly expressed similarly disgusting views and may be reluctant to part with one of his most pugnaciously loyal aides. According to the SPLC, this is just the first drop from over 900 emails obtained by the organization. “Americans should be terrified by the casual way that Stephen Miller, who has enormous influence in the White House, shares racist content and speaks the language of white nationalists in emails to people he apparently considered fellow travelers,” SPLC reporter Michael Hayden said in a press release. “[McHugh] is well aware of the risks she took in giving us the material and confirming information,” Hayden added. “I think that’s incredibly brave.” Disclosure: The author of this piece’s partner works for the Southern Poverty Law Center, but was not directly involved in the reporting on the Miller piece. This is the same dude that spray-painted hair on his head before going on a Sunday pundit show despite the fact that the dude is on TV, like, all the time. He’s a psychopath who gives no fucks and clearly hates anyone with skin a darker shade than “bleached milk” (with an exception for Tang Orange). I wouldn’t be surprised if his Sunday evening ritual was adopting a half dozen kittens from the shelter so he could go home, put on a vinyl of Pagliacci, and slowly down them one by one in a bucket of ice water.

The site aims to be a marketplace for “authentic, fair and conscious tourism” and promises to donate 50% of its commission to social projects selected by local residents. “In Amsterdam the money will go to a community gardening project in the north and an urban agriculture project for migrant women in the south-east – both poorer parts of the city,” said Fairbnb.coop’s Spanish founder, Sito Veracruz.  The site, which is in its beta phase, currently has a small number of properties (rooms and whole apartments) in five pilot cities: Valencia, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Bologna and Venice, though the plan is to add more properties and cities across Europe over the coming months. The Fairbnb.coop idea originated three years ago when Veracruz, who is based in Amsterdam, saw how the rapidly increasing number of holiday rentals negatively affected his neighbourhood. In June this year Amsterdam was one of 10 European cities that wrote to the EU asking for help to counter soaring housing prices and the touristification of areas caused by the boom in short-term holiday lets. He started thinking about setting up an alternative rental service and was soon contacted by residents from Barcelona, Bologna and Venice who were developing similar projects. “We were all from cities that struggle with too much tourism and that was no coincidence,” he said. “We all felt an alternative holiday rental platform was needed.” Unlike Airbnb, where hosts can list multiple properties (in London a quarter of hosts list more than five properties), Fairbnb.coop has a one-home-per-host rule. It also has a ban on properties owned by businesses. Another accusation levelled at Airbnb is that many properties are managed by agencies with multiple staff, contradicting its friendly, locals-led philosophy. In Amsterdam, 40% of Airbnb listings hosted guests for more than the permitted number of nights. Veracruz added: “We share all our data with local authorities and abide by all their rules. In cities that have no – or few – rules, we will, together with residents, press for regulation.” Owners will also be required to provide documents to show they comply with Fairbnb.coop’s rules, proving, for example, that they have no other rental properties. Last week Airbnb announced stricter checks on properties, promising to verify every home on its platform to avoid scams whereby guests are told the property they booked is no longer available or the property doesn’t match the description on the listing. The checks will be in place by December 2020. Airbnb’s chief executive Brian Chesky also said the company would ban party houses following a mass shooting at one its rental homes in California last month. Veracruz refused to comment on the challenge Fairbnb.coop is facing from Airbnb over its name. “It is being handled by lawyers but we are keen to stress our name is Fairbnb.coop. The name reflects the difference between us and other rental platforms. We are a registered co-operative and are not profit-driven” Looking for a holiday with a difference?

149,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/world/australia/fires-climate-change-pragmatism.html,"Advertisement Supported by News analysis The country has long been a model for common-sense public policy. But this week’s fires have revealed once again that its pragmatism stops at climate change. By Damien Cave SYDNEY, Australia — When a mass shooting shattered Australia in 1996, the country banned automatic weapons. In its first years of independence, it enacted a living-wage law. Stable retirement savings, national health care, affordable college education — Australia solved all these issues decades ago. But climate change is Australia’s labyrinth without an exit, where its pragmatism disappears. The wildfires that continued raging on Wednesday along the country’s eastern coast have revealed that the politics of climate in Australia resist even the severe pressure that comes from natural disaster. Instead of common-sense debate, there are culture war insults. The deputy prime minister calls people who care about climate change “raving inner-city lunatics.” Another top official suggests that supporting the Greens party can be fatal. And while the government is working to meet the immediate need — fighting fires, delivering assistance — citizens are left asking why more wasn’t done earlier as they demand solutions. “We still don’t have an energy policy, we don’t have effective climate policy — it’s really very depressing,” said Susan Harris Rimmer, an associate professor at Griffith Law School. Australia is not the only country where the threat of climate change has largely produced inaction or failed promises. President Trump has done everything he can to erase the United States’ climate policy even as dangerous fires ravage California. Canada and South Korea are far from meeting their targets to cut emissions in line with Paris Agreement commitments. But in Australia, where coal is king and water is scarce, the country’s citizens have spent the week simmering with fear, shame and alarm. As a 500-mile stretch from Sydney to Byron Bay continued to face catastrophic fire conditions, with 80 separate blazes burning and at least four deaths reported, Australians have watched, awe-struck, as life-changing destruction has been met with political sniping. Michael McCormack, the No. 2 official in the conservative government, kicked it off on Monday, telling listeners of the country’s most popular morning radio programs that fire victims needed assistance, not “the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital city greenies.” Barnaby Joyce, the government’s special envoy for drought assistance, followed up by suggesting that two people killed by fires near a town called Glen Innes over the weekend might have contributed to their own deaths if they supported the Greens. The victims’ neighbors called his comments “absolutely disgraceful.” But a Greens party senator responded with his own outrage: He said the major parties were “no better than arsonists,” an insult carrying special weight for the world’s most arid inhabited continent. “The higher the flames in the bush, the lower the politics,” blared a headline in The Sydney Morning Herald. While the latest conflict has flared as smoke fills the skies of Sydney, its roots go back years, maybe centuries. Even as the country’s emissions continue to soar, it’s been hard to reach a political consensus on energy and climate change policy because of Australia’s mining history and a powerful lobby for one product: coal. “Coal is our N.R.A.,” said Ms. Harris Rimmer, referring to the National Rifle Association, which has stymied changes to gun laws in the United States even as mass shootings have become shockingly common. “They have total control over Parliament.” The comparison has its limits. Coal is not enshrined in the Constitution, as a right to bear arms is in the United States, nor is it a consumer product. But like guns in America, coal helped define the country in its early years of settlement — and is still an outsize presence in Australian life. The industry’s economic benefits reach fewer people than many Australians believe. It frequently hires federal lawmakers after they leave office, and even now politicians often defend coal in patriotic terms. For conservatives in particular, extraction of natural resources in rural areas is a stand-in for values worth fighting for against condescending urban elites. Just a few days before the fires, for example, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a mining group that new laws were needed to crack down on climate activists and progressives who “want to tell you where to live, what job you can have, what you can say and what you can think.” “Climate change has become a proxy for something else,” said Robyn Eckersley, a climate politics expert at the University of Melbourne. What’s galling for many scientists is that the public wants the federal government to do more; polls consistently show that Australians see climate change as a major threat requiring aggressive intervention. And the problems emerging now — fires, cyclones, heat waves, drought, shifts in sea life and the death of the Great Barrier Reef — have been predicted in the public record for years. In 2000, a Senate committee report criticized the government for a lack of action, stating that “Australia’s per capita emissions have shot to the highest in the world,” and making more than 100 recommendations for both reducing emissions and adapting to a more dangerous environment. “Australia will be very negatively affected by climate change given the size of its land mass,” the report says, “its long coastline, current extremes of climate, vulnerability to cyclones and the El Niño/La Niña cycle, existing problems with soil salinity, and its economic dependence on agriculture and tourism.” Fires have been a focus of in-depth reports since at least 2013, when the nonprofit Climate Council issued its first one: “Be Prepared: Climate Change the Australian Bushfire Threat.” Even firefighters, who scramble the class and urban-rural divide that the government often tries to exploit, have tried to tell officials that they need to confront the way that the changing climate supercharges the already dangerous threat of fires. “We’ve seen these incidents becoming larger and more intense,” said Leighton Drury, a fire union official in New South Wales. “It would be very silly for any politician or any leader to keep their head in the ground and say we don’t need to do anything here.” Nonetheless, for now, that is what the government is doing. Mr. Morrison, who in the past has made it clear that Australia’s economic prosperity comes first, has repeatedly argued in recent days that now is not the time to discuss climate policy or politics. Photographed hugging fire victims, he has sought to focus on emotional and financial support. Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and author, said that “it wastes the opportunity to explain to the Australian public what we’re seeing in climate extremes.” Unfortunately, more opportunities are on the way. Strong winds and high temperatures are predicted for this weekend, leading fire officials to warn that the blazes already burning will spread, while new conflagrations will produce more demands for help. The pressure on the Australian government to do for the climate what it’s done for other policy problems will only grow with the flames. Isabella Kwai and Jamie Tarabay contributed reporting.

150,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/daca-california.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today Wednesday: The case has major implications for the Golden State. Also: Caspian terns and evolving quinceañeras. By Jill Cowan Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) On Tuesday, the Supreme Court finally heard arguments over the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program that has kept roughly 700,000 young, unauthorized immigrants in limbo for years. Here’s what you need to know: Need a refresher on DACA and Dreamers? In 2012, President Barack Obama introduced the program, which shields people who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. It was intended as a stopgap measure, and didn’t provide a pathway to citizenship. But it did allow participants, known as Dreamers, to get work permits, and in some states, including California, to access in-state tuition and legally drive. Dreamers can renew their status in two-year intervals. Recipients who aren’t veterans have to be enrolled in high school or have a diploma or G.E.D. and cannot — contrary to what President Trump has said — have a serious criminal history. In 2017, President Trump moved to end the program after nine conservative state attorneys general threatened to sue over it. They said it was an overreach of presidential power. President Trump has been conflicted about the program, and his public statements have reflected that. [Read more about DACA and how it got to the Supreme Court.] What happened this week? After years of failed negotiations and fights in lower courts, the case headed to the Supreme Court, setting up one of the most important showdowns of the court’s term. As my colleagues reported, the conservative majority of justices seemed prepared to let the Trump administration end the program, although the more liberal justices expressed skepticism about the administration’s rationale for ending DACA. Now, we wait for a decision, which is expected by June. [Read more about the legal arguments in the case.] How is California involved? California’s connections to the fight are multifaceted and deep. In 2017, Janet Napolitano, who is set to step down as president of the University of California next year, sued to protect the program she helped create as secretary of homeland security. That made U.C. the first university to do so. “America is a beacon of justice and opportunity and today we stood up for the young immigrants who seek both,” Ms. Napolitano said on Tuesday in Washington, where she was joined by undocumented students from the university, as well as professors. [Read about when a California Dreamer went to Washington.] And most of those young immigrants live in California — Los Angeles, in particular, according to a demographic analysis of Dreamers. More than a quarter of initial program acceptances — 222,795 — were for Californians. The median age of entry into the U.S. was 6 years old. Finally, a couple of the lawyers arguing before the court on Tuesday hailed from California. Most notably, there was Theodore Olson, the conservative legal giant who argued for the winning side in Bush v. Gore, which handed the presidency to George W. Bush. He later disappointed some allies when he challenged California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the DACA case, he has served as an unlikely ally to Dreamers. [Read more about why Mr. Olson took on the case.] We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate your reading Times coverage, but we also encourage you to support local news if you can. Today’s news roundup was written by my colleague Inyoung Kang: U.S. Roman Catholic bishops elected a Hispanic immigrant as their president for the first time by elevating Archbishop José H. Gomez of Los Angeles, who has long vowed to defend immigrants amid fears of deportation. [The New York Times] San Diego State University suspended 14 fraternities as it investigated allegations that “possible misconduct” may have been linked to the death of a 19-year-old student over the weekend. [The New York Times] Five people who were wounded during the mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in July filed a lawsuit against the event’s organizers alleging “negligent security measures.” [The Mercury News] How did California become America’s worst housing nightmare? Simply put, according to these reporters, it’s bad government — and the rest of the country is becoming more like California. [Bloomberg] More than 1,000 state police officers misused a sensitive background check database for personal use over the past decade, an investigation found. [The Sacramento Bee] Since statehood, California has pitched itself as a place of reinvention, prosperity, health and progressivism. But in the age of wildfires, the idea of that California Dream has felt exhausted and ironic, a New Yorker writer notes. [The New Yorker] They pledged $1 million to help Butte County residents displaced by the Camp fire. But a proposed shelter was never built after backlash in Chico.

[The New York Times] An American prisoner of war coped in a German camp by drawing a comic book on cigarette wrappers bound with scrap metal. After World War II ended, he returned home to California and put aside his dreams of becoming an artist. Seven decades later, a stranger in New York emailed his son: He had his father’s drawings. [NPR] As conceptions of identity broaden and change, so, too, have quinceañeras, my colleague Walter Thompson-Hernández reported in this lovely visual story. In Pomona, a girl celebrated her Afro-Latina heritage with what she called a “quincenegra.” In Bakersfield, a girl honored her Muslim faith and made her entrance on a horse; she’s part of a riding club.

Lytton has provided expert consulting services to law firms representing gun violence victims.  Georgia State University provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list Mass shootings have become a routine occurrence in America. Gun-makers have long refused to take responsibility for their role in this epidemic. That may be about to change. The U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 12 refused to block a lawsuit filed by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary mass shooting victims, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed. Remington Arms, which manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack, had hoped the broad immunity the industry has enjoyed for years would shield it from any liability. The prospect of more claims from victims of mass shootings puts new pressure on the gun industry to reconsider the way it does business. My research over the past 20 years on lawsuits against the gun industry examines how the threat of civil liability has the potential to promote safer gun designs, encourage more responsible marketing practice and reduce the risk of illegal retail sales. A 2006 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers broad immunity from civil lawsuits that arise out of the criminal misuse of a weapon. However, this immunity does not apply where a manufacturer “knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing” of a firearm. The Sandy Hook families allege that Remington, by marketing certain guns to civilians, engaged in “unethical” business methods in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Specifically, they argued Remington “marketed, advertised and promoted the Bushmaster XM15-E2S for civilians to use to carry out offensive, military-style combat missions against their perceived enemies.” Remington asked the court to throw out the lawsuit based on the federal immunity statute, but the Connecticut Supreme Court held that a violation of the state’s unfair trade practices law qualifies as an exception to the industry’s liability shield. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear Remington’s appeal, the case will move into discovery and, potentially, trial in a Connecticut state court. Since many states have unfair trade practices laws like Connecticut’s, gun violence victims are likely to bring similar claims elsewhere, effectively ending the gun industry’s federal immunity from civil lawsuits. In other industries, the threat of civil liability has encouraged manufacturers to take steps in design, marketing and retail to reduce the risk of injuries associated with their products. Lawsuits have prompted automakers to develop safer car designs, vaping companies to end marketing aimed at teens and opioid manufacturers to take responsibility for oversupplying pills to irresponsible retailers. Similarly, exposing gun manufacturers to civil liability is likely to encourage them to consider reducing the lethality of their civilian weapons. The popularity of semiautomatic firearms increases the risk that gun violence incidents will cause multiple gunshot wounds to large numbers of victims. Companies may wish to limit their liability exposure by reducing the firepower of their products. Additionally, companies may wish to reconsider marketing campaigns that extol the combat characteristics of weapons they sell on the civilian market. Such campaigns are likely to give rise to more lawsuits alleging that such promotional tactics increase the risk that their guns will be the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Finally, lawsuits may encourage gun companies to work harder to teach retailers how to spot and prevent illegal straw purchases, in which a person buys a gun for someone else who is legally prohibited from purchasing it. The industry’s trade association – the National Shooting Sports Council – has long had a training and certification program for retailers to reduce the risk of illegal straw purchases. Beefing up that effort is another way to reduce the industry’s liability exposure. None of these actions would weaken the Second Amendment or undermine the commercial viability of the gun industry. Regardless of whether the Sandy Hook families ultimately prevail, the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to hear an appeal in the case appears to have blown a giant hole in the gun industry’s immunity from civil litigation. However, this may not be the court’s last word on the subject. The justices might have another opportunity to review the case if the Sandy Hook plaintiffs win and the case works its way back up to the high court. The Supreme Court could then decide that the exception to federal immunity applies more narrowly. Moreover, there is no guarantee that other state courts will adopt the Connecticut Supreme Court’s interpretation of the immunity exception. Federal courts in New York and California have rejected similar lawsuits. Also, unfair trade practices laws in other states frequently limit lawsuits to product consumers, excluding claims by others injured by the products. In addition, gun violence victims face other challenges in winning their claims. They must convince judges and juries that routine industry marketing strategies constitute unfair trade practices and prove that those practices played a role in enabling criminal attacks. Prior to passage of federal immunity, no plaintiff ever won a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer for an injury arising out of criminal misuse of a weapon. Finally, litigation is not a panacea. Stemming the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. will require a concerted effort by industry, government and organized citizen groups across the political spectrum. Lawsuits can help jump-start this process, but they are only the beginning. [ Expertise in your inbox.

11.13.2019 1:15 PM The Supreme Court yesterday declined to intervene in a lawsuit that seeks to hold Remington Arms responsible for the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. That decision means the plaintiffs—a survivor of the attack and relatives of nine people murdered at the school—can try to prove in state court that Remington violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) by marketing the Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle used by the perpetrator, Adam Lanza, in a way that emphasized its ""militaristic and assaultive qualities."" The CUTPA claim was the one cause of action left standing by the Connecticut Supreme Court last March, when it rejected a breathtakingly broad understanding of ""negligent entrustment"" that would make any supplier of military-style rifles liable for crimes committed with them. Under CUTPA, people can seek damages for injuries caused by ""unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce."" Both theories were attempts to get around the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a 2005 federal law that generally protects gun manufacturers and distributors from liability for criminal uses of their products. The CUTPA claim is based on one of the exceptions made by the PLCAA, which allows lawsuits alleging that ""a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought."" The question presented to the U.S. Supreme Court, which it decided not to consider at this point, is whether that exception ""encompasses alleged violations of broad, generally applicable state statutes"" like CUTPA. Remington and briefs supporting its position argue that the phrase ""statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product"" should be read to mean a firearm-specific law. They note that both examples mentioned in the PLCAA involve such laws, and they cite legislative history indicating that Congress intended to block lawsuits like this one. ""The lawsuits the PLCAA was enacted to address commonly included claims of negligent, unfair, or deceptive advertising, as well as claims under state unfair trade
practices statutes,"" Remington notes in its Supreme Court brief. ""During the debates, Senator [Orrin] Hatch specifically criticized lawsuits 'citing deceptive marketing' and 'claim[ing] that sellers give the false impression that gun ownership enhances personal safety.'"" The plaintiffs, by contrast, argue that ""statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product"" means any law that could be applied to firearms. Their interpretation was endorsed by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which disagreed on that point with two federal appeals courts. In the 2009 case Ileto v. Glock, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit concluded that ""Congress had in mind…statutes that regulate manufacturing, importing, selling, marketing, and using firearms or that regulate the firearms industry,"" as opposed to ""general tort theories that happened to have been codified by a given jurisdiction."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit allowed for a somewhat broader understanding of the exception in the 2008 case City of New York v. Beretta, saying it might include ""a statute of general applicability"" that does not explicitly mention firearms. But the court warned that reading ""applicable"" to mean ""capable of being applied"" would allow the exception to ""swallow the statute."" In a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear this case, the National Rifle Association likewise warns that ""the exception allowed by the Connecticut Supreme Court will swallow the [PLCAA] rule nationwide."" It notes that ""many other states"" have laws similar or identical to CUTPA, ""any one of which can now be used to circumvent national policy if the decision below is not corrected."" The result, it says, will be precisely the sort of frivolous but expensive litigation that Congress saw as a threat to the Second Amendment. ""Exempting Respondents' lawsuit from PLCAA's immunity will result in a de facto ban on manufacturing or selling firearms, effectively preventing law-abiding Americans from purchasing constitutionally protected instruments,"" the NRA says. ""This ban eventually will grow to encompass the sale of virtually every firearm in nearly every jurisdiction. Imposing what is effectively a company-killing level of liability cannot be squared with the basic policy judgments that underlie the Second Amendment. The right to acquire firearms is meaningless if the industry that provides firearms is litigated out of existence."" Then again, if this lawsuit ultimately fails, any flurry of litigation it inspires may be sparse and brief. The plaintiffs still have to prove that Remington's marketing was not only ""unfair or deceptive"" under CUTPA but also, per the PLCAA, ""a proximate cause"" of the Sandy Hook massacre. The Connecticut Supreme Court also applies a proximity requirement to CUTPA claims. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group that asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up this case, notes that the plaintiffs have not offered any evidence that Lanza or his mother, who bought the rifle he used, was ""influenced in any way by any advertisement,"" let alone that advertising precipitated the mass shooting or made it deadlier. As the Connecticut Supreme Court itself observed while allowing the lawsuit to proceed, ""proving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task.""

Giving what I’ve heard of the situation I find it at least possible that she intentionally raised him to become a psycho killer.  At which point pre-buying his tools makes some sense. Psycho killer, qu’est-ce que c’est? i hate people when they’re not polite. That’s what Stanley Ann Dunham was aiming for. Where did she go wrong? She went wrong by punishing us with her baby. Heck, it should be irrelevant considering that the kid pulled the trigger. What do you want, sanity? And then he murdered her to steal her guns? Remington violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) by marketing the Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle used by the perpetrator, Adam Lanza, in a way that emphasized its “militaristic and assaultive qualities.” That’s some hella advertising if it can convince you to kill your mother and steal her gun. AirJordan-level. Have you seen the instruction manual/warning sheet that comes with most new firearms? I suppose they should add a line about not murdering your parents. You clearly haven’t met his mother. gotta be the gun, Money. …would make any supplier of military-style rifles liable for crimes committed with them. Then sue his mother. Nah, sue the shooter in his capacity of self-supplier, considering he stole the gun.  Oh wait, theft is already illegal. Fake news.  If there was a law against theft, nobody would steal. /Beto His mother was the first one he killed.  Have fun trying to serve her with a summons. You just have to attest giving it to her, she doesn’t have to acknowledge receipt. All you need is someone to say they overheard a conversation that may have involved a receipt. Uh…didn’t think I had to explain that part. Given that she is dead, how do they establish that the marketing of the “militaristic or assaultive qualities” motivated her to buy it?  Or will that just be presumed for anyone who purchased one? From what I recall she reportedly got into this as a way to engage her autistic son in a joint activity; will her presumed motivation then be transferred to he equally dead son who killed her for it? “Then again, if this lawsuit ultimately fails, any flurry of litigation it inspires may be sparse and brief.” It appears you don’t quite understand the lawfare campaign that inspired the Lawful Commerce act. They wouldn’t have minded winning the lawsuits, but the actual plan was to bankrupt the industry with litigation costs even if they lost every single lawsuit. They don’t need this sort of lawsuit to be successful to pursue their goals. They just need it to be permitted. This.   They don’t have to prove anything, they just have to draw it out long enough to crush the opponent under legal fees. They don’t have to prove anything, they just have to draw it out long enough to crush the opponent under legal fees. Reason number 999 for a Loser Pays system. I’d like to see the add that said go kill people. isn’t that part of their complaint that the adds were miss leading or dog whistling to kill or something like that isn’t that part of their complaint that the adds were miss leading or dog whistling to kill or something like that That’s the claim – i.e. that they violated the laws governing the way they advertise.  I don’t think anyone is confident it will stand up in court.  All this decision does is allow them to go forward and try to make the argument. Like so many other legal ills, you could go a long way towards preventing such bullshit with loser pays.  Why we still have each party pay their own bill is beyond me. If you have a good case, especially against deep pockets, loser pays would also really help poor people, because lawyers could make their own judgement as to likelihood of winning and being paid. Why does our legal system hate poor people so much? It’s run by lawyers, and it isn’t in the interest of lawyers to discourage lawsuits. +1 We have a kind of “Loser Pays” system in California already. “Loser Pays” is also a really good tool to use against poor people.  When I worked for a small contractor, a larger contractor reamed us on pretty much that exact principle – “we’re going to run up thousands and thousands of hours in legal fees which we’re then going to come after you for.  How confident are you?” The fact of the matter is that when you wind up in actual court, it’s generally because both sides are being jerks (this was true for my small contractor, as well).  What I’ve been led to believe by lawyers is that the only time one party gets awarded legal fees is if it becomes clear that the other side is acting in the sort of bad faith that would have led most people to settle. If you lost your cases and had to pay, how much was because you had a crappy case and should have settled instead of fighting?  If you lost because you had a good case but not the funds to fight,  it must not have been a very good case to lose. Liberals think it would be a victory for them if U.S. gun manufacturers were sued out of existence. They don’t seem to realize that this would only create the mother of all black markets. No, they realize that, but that just gives them an excuse to bring the weight of the state down on anybody they find with a black market gun. Your assertion is that people, liberals, want to sue gun manufacturers out of existence.  But is that really the case here.  The plaintiffs are arguing that Remington specifically emphasized the military nature and killing power of the gun.  Would this really affect hunting rifles?  Would it affect handguns if the emphasize was on defense?  The vast majority of people appear to want reasonable limits on and not elimination of guns. So what if they did? How is that a crime? And what is a reasonable limit? It is not a crime it is part of civil litigation and an a question of liability. Okaaaaaay . . . so what did they do that’s so problematic that it warrants civil litigation and a question of liability? And you didn’t define “reasonable limits.” I don’t think all liberals/leftists want to sue them out of existence.  But some certainly do. I would agree with that statement.  I have no problems with people have guns for hunting and sports (target shooting and trap).  I have no problem with handguns for self protection.  I do think all guns sales should require background checks.  And yes that includes a grandchild buying grandpa gun.  Sorry but as the Sandy Hook shooting shows, family members are not always the best at judging other family members.  I think gun magazine should be limited to no more than ten rounds.  I think defending yourself in a mass shooting is doubtful, but 10 run magazines at least gives a person a chance.  I think military style weapons should be limited to target ranges and must remain on the range facility at all times.  I would even allow fully automated weapons.  Again provided they are never allowed off range. What you do/don’t have a problem with is irrelevant with regard to what is protected by 2A. ^^^ He’s right you know. In DC v Heller writing for the majority Justice Scalia noted in Section III of his opinion that there are limitation on the 2A.  Specifically noting qualification on sales, limited access to certain individuals, and dangerous weapons.  So I don’t think my opinion is outside the 2A. Starting to look like a Hinh sock. You are a fucking idiot and know nothing about firearms or the Second Amendment. And you display this on a consistent basis. Sorry for the mis-threading, meant for Moderation4ever. Which just shows the problem with “mainstream” positions on this issue.  The Second Amendment wasn’t written to defend trap shooting shotguns or gentlemen’s dueling pistols.  And how do you know 10 rounds will be enough to defend yourself? YOU do not get to decide what is or is not necessary or appropriate. In other words, go take a fucking leap, asshole. Exactly. We can buy what we want when we want for whatever purpose we want. Only if and when gun owners use their weapons in an offensive manner against people or property is there a problem. In other words, have perfectly good gun controls already in place. They are called laws against murder, rape, robbery, etc. Otherwise, gun owners are INNOCENT and should be left the hell alone. The vast majority of people also don’t mind raising taxes, as long as they don’t have to pay them. You failed litmus test #119 of true libertarian, that is, not recognizing that the vast majority is a bloodthirsty mob. Every “hunting rifle” has more killing power than any AR15. The AR15 is typically chambered in 5.56mm and was designed as a civilian target and varmint rifle. The typical “hunting” rifle is chambered in 7.62mm and was designed as a military rifle. In fact, semi-automatic rifles were originally designed as civilian rifles, and the only reason the modern stereotype of a hunting rifle is a bolt action is because after WWI the US government sold off the millions of excess M1903 Springfield rifles they had in stock….. all of which were in 7.62mm, specifically the 30-06 (thirty-ought-six) cartridge. Before that semi-auto rifles dominated the hunting market, but when the Feds drastically undercut prices with high quality modern surplus rifles it changed the dynamic of the market, especially as all returning GIs were accustomed to the M1903. It’s the same reason that so many choose the AR15 – it’s similar enough to the M4s and M16s we all used in the sandbox or the rock pile that we can all pick one up and be instantly familiar with it. So if “weapons of war” is the issue, the AR15 isn’t it – it’s never been fielded by any army, unlike the most popular hunting rifles, every one of which has been. And if killing power is the issue then an M1 Garland is far more dangerous as it can shoot just as fast and fires a larger, heavier, and faster bullet. But the issue has always been black guns. Blacks with guns in California when Reagan banned carry, and black guns today with people who fundamentally don’t understand them. It would be like banning the printing of books in black ink because most hate speech is printed in black ink – it entirely misunderstands what the issue is, even accepting that the claimed issue is in fact an issue. “The AR15 is typically chambered in 5.56mm and was designed as a civilian target and varmint rifle.” This is not true.  Armalite, the company that designed it, tried to sell it to the Pentagon right away, but the Pentagon didn’t want it.  The A in AR stands for Armalite, not assault. While they chose 5.56mm for the prototypes they tried to sell to the Pentagon, the AR-15 platform was actually designed to be modular.  You can take a single lower and swap out uppers set up in different calibers for mission specific purposes. Today, the AR-15 is available in a number of different and interesting rounds including 6.5mm Grendel, .50 Beowulf, and .458 SOCOM As far as I remember when this mess first broke in the media, the now departed Mum nd her boyfriend participated in various styles of sport shooting and competitions. Some of those include the use of the Modern Sporting Rifle, of whcih class the Bushmaster falls. Three Gun compet ions are quite popular nationwide, even internationally, and the Bushmaster is one of the preferred rifles for that sport. AR type rifles are also legal, and used for, many other services. Control of larger predators and pests, (coyotes feral cats, feral pigs, gophers, rats, ‘coon, ‘possum, gators and crocs…. They also are rather flat shooting at nearer ranges, one can zero a Bushmaster at 25 yards, and put the sights on anything out to three hundred yards and HIT IT. Move the target out to 400 yards, simply apply a six inch “holdover” and still put that gator in the boat. WHY do the prattling masses who fear the Monster in the Shed to the point of catatonic trances think the AR is ONLY good for kiling innocent people? IF killing innocent people were ALL It is good for WHY are there some fifteen millions of the AR tyoe rifle, and only about 300 deaths nationwide using ALLtypes of long guns (Great Grandpa’s bolt action 1903 Soringfield included) .Sorry simple maths will not support the charge laid against the AR. “Your assertion is that people, liberals, want to sue gun manufacturers out of existence. ” Because we literally have them on record saying that was their intention. Part of the reason the Lawful Commerce act got passed in the first place! “The plaintiffs are arguing that Remington specifically emphasized the military nature and killing power of the gun. Would this really affect hunting rifles?” A bullet from any of my centerfire hunting rifles (Marlin 336 in .30-30, Puma M92 in .357 Magnum, SMLE in .303 Brit) has greater killing power than than a 5.56 NATO/.223 Rem bullet from a Colt clone of the  Armalite Rifle Model 15. Adam Lanza murders the gun owner and steals the gun. Blame manufacturer advertising. Progressive logic goes further off the deep end with each passing day. This isn’t a defeat for the gun manufacturers. Its the Supreme Court saying “let it get litigated at the lower levels before you bring it to us”. ^ This. It’s not a complete defeat for them, but unless the lawsuit gets sanctioned as frivolous, it’s at least a partial defeat, because they’re out the money they spent defending against it, and then somebody comes along as sues them again on only slightly different grounds. But the point of PLCAA was to say that it shouldn’t get litigated at the lower levels. The question was whether PLCAA applies – and that was litigated at the lower levels.  As the article notes, there’s even a diversity of opinion with this state supreme court now conflicting with two federal courts.  The Supreme Court punted instead of doing their jobs. What the fuck are “assaultive qualities”? IANAL, but can you really sue someone using made-up words? Damn right you can sue using made up words. They are the best to use in suing, because you get to say what the made up words really mean. “Damn right you can sue using made up words.” See: Assault Weapon. Yes, but like the term “assault weapon” it’s a tautological term. An “assault weapon” is a weapon you use to assault someone, whether words, sticks, swords, or rifles. So an “assaultive quality” is just a well implemented assault. We should praise fine craftsmen, even if their craft is a morally reprehensible one. Wait til they sue over “assault vehicles” _ four  wheel drive / all terrain land vehicles _ inflatable rubber boats with outboard motors _ short takeoff/landing aircraft (bush planes) _ helicopters. Seriously. Amnesty International went on the record urging that international arm trade restrictions should equate civilian “brush shotguns” of the “slug gun” or “deerslayer” models to military combat shotguns and police riot guns, equate civilian benchrest or long range target rifles to military or police sniper rifles, and police riot control vehicles to military combat vehicles and apply all international restrictions including end user certificates to domestic manufacture and sales. Given that the Toyota pickup truck especial the diesel engine models are commonly converted to “technicals” or improvised insurgency warfare vehicles, banning anything suitable for military assault purposes could devolve down to camouflage utility clothing and “combat” boots. A strict reading of US v Miller 1939 would protect  “assault rifle” AR-15 (ArmaLite Rifle Model 15) clones of the current US military issue M16 rifle and M4 carbine above all other firearms as most suitable for military marksmanship training. PLCAA exception:    “a manufacturer or seller of a qualified product knowingly violated a State [in this case CUTPA] or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product, and the violation was a proximate cause of the harm for which relief is sought.” So if I am reading this correctly,  the cause for action here is that “by marketing the Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle used by the perpetrator, Adam Lanza, in a way that emphasized its “militaristic and assaultive qualities,” substantiates a violation that serves as the proximate cause for the harm. So Mrs Lanza legally buys a gun, for whatever reason.  Then her son kills her and takes the gun, that he uses to kill others. Does this come anywhere near a working definition of proximate cause? It does for purposes of rationalizing lawfare against a firearms company. Not otherwise. You’d fail “proximate cause” just on the basis of the fact that the gun wasn’t purchased by the killer. It’s rather dubious that the advertising inspired the theft. And how does the jury determine the state of mind of persons, in this case Mrs L and her loony son, who are dead?  How can they know that marketing had anything to do with it, absent any documentation [which, as I recall, AL thoroughly destroyed before he committed his heinous acts and offed himself. It’s worse than that, because an illegal act by another party breaks the proximate cause chain in every jurisdiction, so even if the advertising convinced her to buy the gun for the explicit purpose of having her son use it to kill people – and that’s what you’d have to allege to get anywhere near proximate cause – then it was a straw purchase which is already illegal and breaks proximate cause. So the only way the court allows that is if they use the “but guns” clause in the constitution. The purpose of this clause in the law was clear though – it was to allow for manufacturer liability for unsafe products so that if a barrel blew up the manufacturer could be potentially liable for it. “The purpose of this clause in the law was clear though – it was to allow for manufacturer liability for unsafe products so that if a barrel blew up the manufacturer could be potentially liable for it.” Yep, genuine product liability suits where the gun was so defective it was a danger to the user. So  strictly product liability, not miss or criminal use. “Does this come anywhere near a working definition of proximate cause?” Nope. But that don’t confront Progtards. I would think the advertising was deceptive if the weapon failed to kill. >>”militaristic and assaultive qualities.” the adverts are not misleading when taken from the perspective of home defense Precisely, the fact that guns are capable of killing things is part of why I own them. I don’t want to kill things, just be prepared to do so in the event I’m forced to. If a manufacturer advertised the non-lethality of their firearms I suspect they wouldn’t sell very many. your testimony could help the Remington summary judgment motion. Slight disagreement, in some cases at least. I don’t care if my home defense guns kill an attacking intruder, I just care that they stop them immediately. It’s one case where stopping power is more important than killing power, and why some people run birdshot rather than slugs in their shotguns. A slug will definitely kill, but birdshot at 10-20 feet found inside a home will leave a hole the size of your fist (See Paul Harrels tests, or anyone else’s, on YouTube). A cousin of mine for example uses an ancient 45-70 as her home defense gun, even though she has a 338 Lapua over the door, just because it has better stopping power at short range (caveat: she’s in Alaska, so atypical use cases) and a larger magazine. Yup. gotta have somethin ta remove them pesky two legged predators. Some of them wear fur onesies, some don’t. But isn’t this just like all the lawsuits against the car manufactures for all the death, injury and damage from drunk driving? Well, it’s more like all the lawsuits against car companies where the drunk driver first murdered the owner of a racing-inspired car, like a Ferrari or Porsche, then stole the car, then intentionally drove the racing-inspired car through a crowd of schoolchildren because he saw an ad in a magazine that SPECIFICALLY made him think this car was the one to use in his murderous driving spree. Nobody NEEDS a car than can do 0-60 in 3.1 seconds or bust a quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds or top out at 250 miles per hour. They’re obviously designed to kill people. P.S. “racing-inspired” != racing…no real racing teams are using production vehicles and “military-style” civilian weapons are not actually used by real military Don’t forget to mention the “race-ist” qualities. True. The really crazy thing is, the most commonly used weapons for hunting are, or were until very recently, repurposed military weapons. My Dad’s brothers all had 1903 Springfield bolt action rifles which they used for hunting deer, elk, bear, moose. I know one man who took a surplus 6.5 Sweded Carl GUstaf, made his own Monte Carlo style stock, and used that to take deer, cougar, elk, at ranges of 400 yards and more, one shot drop them in their tracks kills. Others I know have used surplus 8m  Mauser rifles, others the amazing 7;5 Swiss Schmidt Rubin K 31 or K 33 rifles. Used to know a man, when I was a kid, whose deer rifle was a disused French military rifle, the legendary 8mm Lebel, another used in Italian 6.5mm carcano. The old British Enfield .303 Brit has fallen out of common  use, but when I was a kid they were not that rare. They could be had for $25 to $50 depending on condition and who was selling them, ALL these rifles and their rounds were specifically designed for use as a military grade weapon of war. It is the reason they exist. FUrther, I’ve never known of anyone getting the screaming fantods when happening upon someone with an M 1 Garand rifle. This weapon was specifically designed and manufactured for the express purpose of killing large numbers of humans, at ranges out to 1,000 yards in common use. I know one man who is a long haul truck driver, manages to come into every one of rhe Lower Forty Eight, He will NOT be on the road unarmed. He often travels into or through states where his possession of a handgun is a serious felony. What to do? His “truck gun” is a bone stock CMP M 1 Garand. He can legally keep that in his truck anywhere in the USA. THAT is a weapon specifically designed to be a weapon of war…. and now kept against the day he may need some signficant took to use in thedefense of his life. Never mind the rig, he can always get another. Meanwhile, the psychiatrists feeding him Big Pharma psychotropics, which have Black Box warnings on them, citing “May cause homicidal and suicidal thoughts”… yeah, they  go scot-free! Heaven forbid that anyone criticize the mega-schools apparently modeled on the federal mega-prisons designed to concentrate people in a hostile environment where joining cliques (gangs) is the only way to survive, where bulling or ranking is common behavior, where the fragile are pushed over the edge into suicide or drugged and abused til they lose it and go over the edge. There  is always something to be scapegoated as the cause and banned and any defenders of the scapegoat demonized. My RAM3500 is tougher than ….. I just hope my son doesn’t kill me, steal it and go on a rampage down a crowded sidewalk So how many people who purchased this rifle went out and committed murder with it?  Since there are multiple manufacturer of this style of rifle could that one have been selected just because of it’s price or what the dealer carried?   This are questions no LIBTARD is going to answer in good faith. Nothing a libtard does is in good faith. These plaintiffs’ case seems about as solid as the one in the Lucky Gunner case, and we all know how that turned out…with the suing parents being left hung out to dry by the Brady Campaign lawyers who convinced them to bring the suit. Usually you sue the manufacturer when their product doesn’t work as intended, not when it does. Defective product liability should apply to a lethal product that no reasonable person would or should expect to be lethal – like teddy bears or baby cribs. Remington should demand PROOF beyond any reasonable doubt that any BUshmaster was actually used to kill anyone at that school building on that day. Ballistics testing to PROVE at least one projectile recovered from at least one of the dead or injured victims that day was fired from THAT Bushmaster. If they cannot prove that, no amount of advertising by Remington could possibly have led to the massacre as they have NO PROOF one was used to actually kill on that day and in that place. That would be a bit difficult, and quite the trick to get this clearly ant–gun judge to agree to such a requirement. Remington is not the original designer of the AR15 platform (that would be Armalite) and today there are dozens of companies making AR15 pattern rifles.  Ballistics will not distinguish between different makes of AR15s.  Though it make be able to identify a specific rifle. LOL!  Their lawyers aren’t going to demand that because their lawyers aren’t stupid Sandy Hook truthers with maggot-ridden brains. Instead their lawyers will almost certainly stipulate to the facts of the shooting itself to avoid having any detailed discussion of the issue at trial. Lawyers Rule Another decision by lawyer-judges that amounts to the latest edition of the Lawyers’ Full-Employment Act. We live in a society dominated by lawyerism . Lawyers! Merchants of misery. The following excerpt from the novel, Retribution Fever, is an alternative vision for the nation: Lawyers no longer dominate domestic society.  The tens of millions of frivolous, parasitic lawsuits lie buried among other misdeeds of the past.  The thousands of arbitrary, whimsical, and capricious judicial decisions lie buried with them.  Americans justifiably can boast of an open and honest federal government of, by, and for an enlightened and worthy people. I see one bright, shining silver lining to this — I expect the plaintiffs to be unable to make the connection between the offense and Remington, if not at the state level, when it reaches the USSC.  This will kill the whole movement at the root, rather than shading it behind a law which lets the hoplophobes claim that they are right. I also imagine a lot of gunmakers and ammunition manufacturers refusing to sell their products to government agencies in states where such laws have been imposed, citing the liability they would face if a suspect takes a gun from a cop. It will never go before SCOTUS. Reason has been compromised. I see the case is scheduled for trial next year.  If there is no allegation that the purchaser, i.e., the killer’s mother, was exposed to Remington’s marketing, what is there to prove?  Remington should move to dismiss on that ground.

153,https://www.salon.com/2019/11/13/white-house-uses-anti-semitism-defense-after-miller-is-busted-for-promoting-white-nationalism/,"The White House claimed that Trump adviser Stephen Miller was the victim of “anti-Semitism” and smears after leaked emails showed that he promoted white nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric through the far-right news outlet Breitbart. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a report Tuesday titled “Stephen Miller’s Affinity for White Nationalism Revealed in Leaked Emails,” which was based on more than 900 emails Miller sent to Breitbart editors between 2015 and 2016. The emails were given to the SPLC by Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who was fired in 2017 for posting anti-Muslim tweets and has since denounced the far-right. The emails show that Miller was regularly in contact with Breitbart editors in the 15 months leading up to the 2016 election. In them, Miller regularly referenced reports from the white nationalist site VDARE, the white supremacist site American Renaissance and the conspiracy theory repository InfoWars. Miller urged editors to play up crimes committed by immigrants and people of color and sought to “create a narrative” about the removal of the Confederate flag after the 2015 mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Edison Hayden, the SPLC staffer who published the emails, wrote that he was “unable to find any examples of Miller writing sympathetically or even in neutral tones about any person who is non-white or foreign-born.” McHugh suggested that the emails from Miller, an immigration hardliner who was behind the Trump administration’s most controversial assaults on immigrants, offer a glimpse into the policy advice he has likely given the president. ""What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration,"" she said. While Miller has yet to comment on the report, a White House official asserted that the Trump adviser was the real victim. ""This is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against a Jewish staffer,” an unnamed White House official told Axios. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told The Washington Post that she had not seen the report but claimed that the SPLC, a respect civil rights nonprofit, was an “utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization,” even though the emails were handed to them by McHugh. “They are beneath public discussion, even in The Washington Post,” Grisham said. Miller’s allies have played the anti-Semitism card before. Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and others accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., of anti-Semitism when she called Miller a “white nationalist” on Twitter in April. Omar fired back Tuesday at her critics. “As I said earlier this year: Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. And now we have the emails to prove it,” she wrote. “This type of racism and hatred has no place in our government. Miller needs to step down.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. “He’s still at the White House shaping US immigration policy. Miller must resign. Now.” Democratic presidential candidates also called out Miller on Twitter. “Stephen Miller’s white nationalist views are a danger to the American people,” tweeted Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro went further, calling Miller a “neo-Nazi.” “Donald Trump put a Neo-Nazi in charge of immigration policy,” Castro tweeted. “Both him, and Stephen Miller, are a shame to our nation.” The emails also appeared to cross a line for some on the right. “A damning email dump from former Breitbart editor Katie McHugh points to Miller simply being a racist who hates immigrants,” columnist Tiana Lowe wrote at the right-wing Washington Examiner. “Interns have been fired for less than this. We can't say with certainty what hate is or isn't in Miller's heart, but we know that he was happy enough to use the work of hatemongers and kill the GOP's last shot at immigration reform, apparently because it would help predominantly Mexican immigrants.

154,https://www.alternet.org/2019/11/white-house-uses-anti-semitism-defense-after-stephen-miller-is-busted-for-promoting-white-nationalism/,"The White House claimed that Trump adviser Stephen Miller was the victim of “anti-Semitism” and smears after leaked emails showed that he promoted white nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetoric through the far-right news outlet Breitbart. The Southern Poverty Law Center published a report Tuesday titled “Stephen Miller’s Affinity for White Nationalism Revealed in Leaked Emails,” which was based on more than 900 emails Miller sent to Breitbart editors between 2015 and 2016. The emails were given to the SPLC by Katie McHugh, a former Breitbart editor who was fired in 2017 for posting anti-Muslim tweets and has since denounced the far-right. The emails show that Miller was regularly in contact with Breitbart editors in the 15 months leading up to the 2016 election. In them, Miller regularly referenced reports from the white nationalist site VDARE, the white supremacist site American Renaissance and the conspiracy theory repository InfoWars. Miller urged editors to play up crimes committed by immigrants and people of color and sought to “create a narrative” about the removal of the Confederate flag after the 2015 mass shooting at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. Michael Edison Hayden, the SPLC staffer who published the emails, wrote that he was “unable to find any examples of Miller writing sympathetically or even in neutral tones about any person who is non-white or foreign-born.” McHugh suggested that the emails from Miller, an immigration hardliner who was behind the Trump administration’s most controversial assaults on immigrants, offer a glimpse into the policy advice he has likely given the president. ""What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration,"" she said. While Miller has yet to comment on the report, a White House official asserted that the Trump adviser was the real victim. ""This is clearly a form of anti-Semitism to levy these attacks against a Jewish staffer,” an unnamed White House official told Axios. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told The Washington Post that she had not seen the report but claimed that the SPLC, a respect civil rights nonprofit, was an “utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization,” even though the emails were handed to them by McHugh. “They are beneath public discussion, even in The Washington Post,” Grisham said. Miller’s allies have played the anti-Semitism card before. Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and others accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., of anti-Semitism when she called Miller a “white nationalist” on Twitter in April. Omar fired back Tuesday at her critics. “As I said earlier this year: Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. And now we have the emails to prove it,” she wrote. “This type of racism and hatred has no place in our government. Miller needs to step down. Now.” Fellow Democrats echoed Omar’s call for Miller to resign. “Stephen Miller, Trump’s architect of mass human rights abuses at the border (including child separation & detention camps w/ child fatalities) has been exposed as a bonafide white nationalist,” tweeted Rep.

158,"http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/reports-of-anti-semitic-incidents-at-monument-middle-school-rattle-jewish-students-families,590125"," GREAT BARRINGTON — Police are investigating reports of anti-Semitic threats at Monument Valley Regional Middle School, according to police and school officials. And while those officials stress that there is no credible threat to students' safety, the reports have rattled members of the Jewish community amid a nationwide increase of such incidents in schools and colleges. It is the second anti-Semitic incident at a Massachusetts middle school in recent weeks. ""We are very concerned by this and the unfortunate reminder that anti-Semitism and racism remain part of our community in South County and in our school,"" Monument Middle Principal Ben Doren wrote in an Oct. 31 letter to school families. According to a parent, a student repeatedly had been telling Jewish students that he was going to ""nuke the Jews,"" and that ""I have a list and you're on it, and all the other Jewish kids are on it, too."" Doren, who did not provide these details, noted that ""student use of anti-Semitic language and language referencing school shootings"" had been brought to his attention earlier that week, and that police so far had no evidence of any credible threat to safety. He told The Eagle that privacy laws prevent him from speaking to any disciplinary measures taken against the student, but he said he is taking the incident and larger issue ""very seriously."" ""We're working to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" he said, noting that the problem of religious or other bias is being increasingly worked into the curriculum, and that teachers are expanding study of the Holocaust, race and identity issues, disabilities and civil rights. ""It's so we're ready when an incident like this happens."" While Berkshire Hills Regional School District officials say that the event is a ripe opportunity for learning, and that a communitywide reckoning should ensue, local Jewish leaders who are supporting the targeted students and their families say there is much more to be done, and that the situation calls for a firmer, broader approach. They suggested that a larger community effort to fight anti-Semitism and any kind of racism or intolerance is overdue. ""Right now, the school system isn't hitting the mark,"" said Rabbi Neil Hirsch of Hevreh of Southern Berkshire, a Great Barrington synagogue. ""I would love to hear what the responsibility of the larger community is. If it is the broader community, it means we all could do better."" The reports come at a time when school shootings are frequent, and two mass synagogue shootings have Jewish communities on edge. The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents, found a nearly 60 percent rise in its most recent report in 2017, the most significant increase since 1979, when the nonprofit began tracking data. ""The sharp rise was due in part to a significant increase in incidents in schools and on college campuses, which nearly doubled for a second year in a row,"" according to the ADL's website. Hirsch and Rabbi Jodie Gordon, his colleague at Hevreh, are meeting with school officials, parents of the targeted students and other local Jewish leaders to find a way forward. Doren further said that the school is redoubling its efforts with the ADL's A World of Difference Institute program, which already was underway at the school. ADL staff have worked with 20 sixth, seventh and eighth grade students to train them to do anti-bias work with the younger students, Doren said. He said another group of students will be trained in December. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, one parent of a targeted student told The Eagle that students had reported the alleged ""list"" of Jewish students, as well as other comments and some other behavior, including Nazi salutes, the students found alarming. The parent also said this isn't the first time in recent years that anti-Semitism has hit the school, and says there is the sense among parents that school officials are trying to minimize this incident. ""Kids have found swastikas in the bathroom and carved on the desks,"" the parent added, speaking to past incidents. ""What I don't want is for this to be another one-off ... it just happens to be our Jewish kids this time."" The parent said it should be addressed as a global problem, rather than by specific incident. Gordon, who also is Hevreh's educator, said that over the past seven years that she has worked teaching eighth to 12th grade classes that she has heard students talk about anti-Semitic jokes and notes being passed around at the middle school, as well as posts on social media. ""It does feel connected to an ongoing culture problem,"" she said. 'That's a sign' Local Jewish leaders and ADL staff say there is both an uptick in incidents and a ""heightened awareness"" of vulnerability. ""In the last year, we saw two people on two different sides of the country walk into two different synagogues and open fire,"" Hirsch said, referring to shootings in Pittsburgh and Poway, Calif. ""We're living in a day when I can't even keep straight where the last mass shooting was."" It appears that there are more anti-Semitic rumblings in the schools. ""It's definitely been increasing, because we've been getting so many calls from schools to implement the [A World of Difference] program,"" said Shellie Burgman, spokeswoman for ADL New England. ""There's such a big demand. We have a massive waiting list. That's a sign."" Robert Trestan, ADL New England's regional director, said the organization is ""definitely seeing an increase across the board"" in addition to this second ""serious incident in two weeks"" after a student at a charter school in Framingham reported a Snapchat group called ""Kill the jews."" ""It's a real concern to see students this young being engaged in this kind of targeting and anti-Semitism and it has a profound effect on not just the individual and families, but on the entire community,"" Trestan said. He added that it is important that all students are included in conversations, and that school officials and staff should ""not run from what happened."" ""At Framingham, the discussion began as soon as [students] walked into their classrooms,"" he said of the immediate aftermath of the incident. Berkshire Hills Superintendent Peter Dillon said he thinks that possibly less-dramatic incidents in local schools are more common than anyone is aware of because many go unreported, and that all of it is a reflection of the surrounding culture. ""When anyone is being treated with hate and hate speech, it compromises all of us and the whole community,"" he said. While Trestan says incidents have to be addressed with education, he said it is important to not judge a school because of it. ""We should reserve our judgment for how they respond,"" he said. ""Because in the real world, things happen all the time that are unpredictable."" Dara Kaufman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of the Berkshires, said that such incidents should ignite a strong response. ""Anti-Semitism doesn't exist in a vacuum,"" she said. ""The degree to which this event took place, it feels a little more targeted and scary for the families and the kids.""

159,https://www.theblaze.com/news/high-school-teacher-arrested-for-threatening-to-shoot-students-deputies-say,"When confronted by law enforcement, the teacher allegedly refused to back down from her initial threats. A high school geometry teacher in Washington state has been arrested and booked on several charges, after allegedly threatening to shoot students at Emerald Ridge High School in Puyallup.  The Pierce County Sheriff's Office said Julie Hillend-Jones, 58, was arrested at her home Wednesday morning, when law enforcement questioned her about alleged threats she made the night before while speaking to another adult. PCSD Detective Ed Troyer told 
	KING-TV that Hillend-Jones ""didn't back off"" from the threats she made when investigators pressed her on the claims. ""Everybody knows you don't talk about guns or make any threats in school,"" Troyer said. ""If the student does it, they're going to jail. Now we have a teacher doing it. They're also going to jail, so she's been booked into the Pierce County Jail."" Hillend-Jones was immediately placed on administrative leave Tuesday evening, after her alleged threats were reported to school officials. Now, she faces at least one felony charge of threatening to bomb or injure property. The 
	New York Daily News reported that according to Hillend-Jones's LinkedIn profile, she has worked in the Puyallup School District for 20 years. While the Emerald Ridge High School principal sent out a 
	letter notifying families of the teacher's arrest on Wednesday, some parents expressed frustration at not being told of the situation sooner. ""I am upset,"" Kristen Griffin told 
	KIRO-TV. ""I have a son who's a junior at Emerald Ridge High School, saw on my news feed that there had been a threat — a mass shooting threat — made against my son's school by a teacher, and it's radio silence from the school district.

Stone faces seven charges: one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. A guilty verdict could send the longtime Republican operative to prison and will make him the sixth Trump ally to be convicted of a crime as a result of the special counsel investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. An acquittal could reinforce the president and his allies' longstanding claim that the Russia probe was a ""witch hunt"" meant to hurt him politically. Prefer to listen? Check out the 5 things podcast below and subscribe for free on Apple Podcasts: The Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed in a mass shooting on Aug. 3 will reopen Thursday. A 21-year-old man, Patrick Crusius, has pleaded not guilty to the killings. Crusius, who is accused of using an AK-47-style rifle in the attack, allegedly told authorities after his arrest that he intended to kill as many Mexicans as possible and purportedly posted a white supremacist manifesto online before the attack. A permanent memorial for the shooting victims, to be called ""The Grand Candela,"" is being built by Walmart outside the store. A makeshift memorial outside the store is being removed and will be cataloged and stored. The 20th annual Latin Grammy Awards, nicknamed ""the Biggest Night in Latin Music,"" are set to take place Thursday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. In recent years, top winners have included Luis Miguel, Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi, and Shakira. Alejandro Sanz tops this year's nominations with eight, including record and song of the year for ""No Tengo Nada,"" and album of the year for ""#Eldisco."" Ricky Martin, who performed at the first Latin Grammys in 2000, will co-host along with Roselyn Sanchez (ABC's ""Grand Hotel"") and Paz Vega (""Rambo: Last Blood""). ) The Kentucky governor’s race will take another twist early Thursday as vote totals will be recounted after Gov. Matt Bevin formally requested an official recanvass of the results. Bevin came up about 5,000 votes short in last week's race against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. Democrats made the gubernatorial contest a referendum on Bevin's leadership style as much as his policies, which narrowed access to abortion, approved charter schools and sought to instill a work requirement for able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid. Under Kentucky law, a recanvass is a simple review of the vote totals by each county clerk — counting absentee votes and checking printouts to make sure the numbers they transmitted to the State Board of Elections were correct. A week after winter and red cups arrived at Starbucks, the coffee giant has a festive deal Thursday. From 2 to 7 p.m. there's a buy-one-get-one free offer on all handcrafted beverages, grande or larger.

169,https://newsone.com/3893594/devon-baileys-mother-cops-colorado/,"Posted November 14, 2019 More officers have gotten away with killing a Black teenager. His name was De’Von Bailey and he was killed on Aug. 3 He was only 19 years old. READ MORE: Pack Of White Thugs Brawl At A Popeyes Drive-Thru ‘Over A Chicken Sandwich’ According to BuzzFeed, on Wednesday, a grand jury unanimously decided to not indict the two police officers who shot the 19-year-old in the back. Bailey’s mother Delisha Searcy wrote on Facebook early this morning Facebook, “There was never a robbery, the other guy arrested is facing assault, this is just concerning, the laws in Colorado state that if they think there is a weapon they can use deadly force. CAN is the operative word. And the officer chose to kill my son when he begged to be added to the call.” She continued, “He went there to KILL but in the same state there was a mass shooting in a theatre where so many people were killed….. but that man sits in jail until this day he was taken alive. I can go on and on about the injustices of Colorado because believe me I have done my research. They will be exposed they murdered my son and I will not let it go. We have to stand up for what is right. Ignore the ignorance of ‘others’ because we already know how some of ‘them’ feel about us.”  BuzzFeed claims that Bailey “ran away from officers investigating a reported armed robbery. The shooting was captured on body camera video, which showed the officers later recovering a gun from Bailey’s body. But attorneys for Bailey’s family said the video also showed that Bailey was not threatening officers; he never pointed the gun at anyone and it wasn’t visible in the video until after he was shot.” Officers claim he had a gun in his shorts. District Attorney Dan May justified the decision by saying, “Colorado law is very carefully crafted. If the officer has a reasonable belief that the person has used a deadly weapon in a crime and is still armed, they can use deadly force to prevent that person from being a fleeing felon with that deadly weapon.” He also claimed, “I think our system is about as fair as it can get right now, and certainly our grand jury system is as fair as it’s been certainly the last 200 years.” Our condolences go out to De’von Bailey’s family and friends.

News By Yaron Steinbuch Submit November 14, 2019 | 1:07pm				| Updated November 14, 2019 | 2:03pm Walmart has quietly hired off-duty officers for its stores in El Paso, Texas, as it plans Thursday to reopen the outlet where police say a 21-year-old man targeting Mexicans gunned down 22 people in August with no guard at the site. The reopening will happen unceremoniously after a brief meeting with employees, according to Walmart spokeswoman Delia Garcia, who declined to comment on security measures. Authorities said Patrick Crusius, 21, drove more than 10 hours from his grandparents’ house where he lived in a Dallas suburb to carry out the Aug. 3 mass shooting. Last month, he pleaded not guilty to capital murder charges. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty in what the Justice Department has called an act of domestic terrorism. More than 3,000 people from largely Latino El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were at the store when the attack was unleashed. “There was a time that Walmart hired off-duty officers and for some time prior (to) August 3rd that ceased,” El Paso police spokesman Enrique Carrillo told the Associated Press in an email. He declined to provide more details. When El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen first revealed the phasing out of officers in a city council meeting, council members discussed possibly requiring that off-duty cops be hired at large stores, but the idea hadn’t been implemented. Instead, Walmart quietly started hiring off-duty officers at their stores across the city. “We’re covering Walmarts, we’re also covering Sam’s (Club),” police union head Ron Martin said. “Even the neighborhood Walmarts are being covered. Some of them are being covered by sheriff’s deputies, some of them are being covered by our guys. I mean, I have seen some constables working it.” Pay for the off-duty officers is about $50 an hour depending on their rank, or about double their hourly wage. Walmart declined to discuss the hiring of off-duty cops and whether they are taking similar steps in other cities. “We typically do not share our security measures publicly because it could make them less effective, but they may include hiring additional security, adding cameras in store and using ‘lot cops’ in the parking lot,” Garcia said, referring to security cameras placed in parking lots. “We will continue our long-standing practice of regularly evaluating our staffing, training, procedures, and technology which are designed to provide a safe working and shopping experience,” she added. Some victims of the massacre are suing Walmart over the lack of security. Meanwhile, the manager who was on duty at the Cielo Vista Walmart at the time of the attack planned to be on the roof Thursday to raise the US flag, which has been at half-staff since the massacre. Raising the flag will “symbolize that we are open and ready for business and ready to welcome and embrace our customers as they walk through the door,” Robert Evans, 44, told the El Paso Times on Wednesday as he sat inside the completely renovated store. Evans, a 21-year Walmart employee, vowed a few days after the August shooting to return to the store and continue to be its manager. “I would say they (employees) have pretty much recovered” from the shooting, Evans said. “I’m sure some doubt and things of that nature are still in their minds. But they are eager and ready for the store to open.” With Post wires Read Next School principal who banned 'homosexual' books charged wit... Share Selection This story has been shared 51,176 times.

174,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/14/walmart-where-mass-shooting-occurred-reopens/,"EL PASO, Texas — About 50 shoppers lined up early Thursday ahead of the reopening of a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that had been closed since August, when a gunman police say was targeting Mexicans opened fire in the store and killed 22 people. On the day of the attack, Walmart didn’t have a security guard on duty. But as the doors opened to the public for the first time in three months and shoppers streamed into the renovated space, they passed dozens of sheriff's deputies, security guards and store employees. Workers greeted customers with cheers of “Welcome back to Walmart!” Walmart has quietly hired off-duty officers at its stores in El Paso, Texas, since Aug. 3, when police say Patrick Crusius drove more than 10 hours from his grandparents' house in a Dallas suburb to carry out the attack. Crusius, 21, pleaded not guilty. More than 3,000 people from largely Latino El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were at the store when the attack happened. Among the visitors to the reopened store was Eddie Medina, who walked out carrying a frozen turkey and wearing a T-shirt in honor of his wife, Cecy Medina, a Walmart employee who survived the shooting while working in the women’s clothing section. The shirt reads: “My wife is a cancer survivor and a Walmart survivor. She is El Paso Strong.” Medina, 62, said recent months have been difficult for his wife; her yearlong fight with cancer ended in May, but was followed by her mother’s death and then the shooting. She’s been seeing a psychiatrist paid for by Walmart, but she’s still too traumatized to return to the scene of the crime. “I told her ‘I'm going to go in your place,’"" the husband said. ""I just retired last month so I could stay home and take care of her.” The retail giant reopened the store amid ongoing lawsuits over security on the day of the mass shooting. The interior of the building was rebuilt after authorities took more than 10 days to finish processing blood and bone fragments in the massive crime scene. “There was a time that Walmart hired off-duty officers and for some time prior (to) August 3rd that ceased,” El Paso police spokesman Enrique Carrillo said in an email. He declined to provide more details. When Police Chief Greg Allen first revealed the phasing out of officers during a City Council meeting, council members discussed possibly requiring that off-duty officers be hired at large stores, though the idea hasn’t been implemented. Instead, Walmart started hiring off-duty officers at their stores throughout the city, from its sprawling Supercenters to its smaller neighborhood grocery stores. “We’re covering Walmarts, we’re also covering Sam’s (Club),” said El Paso police union president Ron Martin. “Even the neighborhood Walmarts are being covered.” Martin said it’s unclear how long Walmart will continue to employ off-duty officers at every location. The off-duty officers are paid about $50 per hour, depending on their rank, which is about double the officers’ full-time hourly wage. Walmart officials declined to discuss the hiring of police officers, the costs, or if the company is taking similar steps in other cities. Company spokeswoman Delia Garcia said additional measures could include hiring security guards or adding cameras inside stores or in parking lots. “We will continue our long-standing practice of regularly evaluating our staffing, training, procedures, and technology which are designed to provide a safe working and shopping experience,” Garcia said. John Furner, Walmart CEO for its U.S. business, said on an earnings call with media Thursday that workers at the El Paso store wanted the location reopened “to get back to a normal way of life.” Some victims are suing Walmart over the lack of security on the day of the attack, arguing that the company’s method of evaluating security boils down to an inadequate algorithm and was wantonly reduced. Arnuflo Rascón, 56, is one of the plaintiffs. He was shot in the knee and now walks with a cane. The former salesman said he can’t work because of the injury. Rascón said he expects to receive a letter this month telling him how much money he will receive from the One Fund El Paso, a victim’s relief effort set up after the shooting by a group of El Paso-area nonprofits. “The whole world promises to help but when the moment comes, they don’t,” he told reporters Wednesday, in Spanish. “My savings are dwindling.” Construction workers have broken ground on a permanent memorial in the store’s parking lot, a “Grand Candela” that will be about 30 feet (9 meters) tall and could be finished in as little as three weeks. The reopening of the El Paso store also comes as Walmart has dipped its toe into the gun debate. It posted signage with its new policy discouraging customers from openly carrying guns. But it is not banning them. Copyright © 2021, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

178,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne8pvw/santa-clarita-school-shooter-allegedly-shot-5-students-and-then-himself,"Early Thursday morning, a 16-year-old boy arrived at Saugus High School with a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol in his backpack. When he got to the quad, located in the center of the sprawling campus in Santa Clarita, California, he pulled out his gun. He shot five people — killing a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy — and then used his last bullet to shoot himself in the head. It was his 16th birthday, said Capt. Kent Wegner, the homicide detective for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, at a press conference around 11:30 a.m. local time. He’s since been taken into custody and is in grave condition, being treated for a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His girlfriend and mother are being interviewed by police. The other injured victims are two girls aged 15 and 14, and a 14-year-old boy. One of those patients is in critical condition and the others are in fair condition. ""We hoped the day would never come, and today it came,"" said Patrick Moody, spokesperson for the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, five miles away, where some of the victims are being treated.

(Photo by Hans Gutknecht/MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News via Getty Images) Police officials said that they identified the shooter through interviewing witnesses firsthand and reviewing surveillance footage. They also sought to quash rumors percolating through social media that there had been direct threats to the school in recent days. Wegner said they’re in the process of scraping the suspect’s social media to determine whether there were any red flags they had missed. Thursday’s tragedy transformed the California town 40 miles north of Los Angeles into the latest backdrop for an American mass shooting. “Another somber and sobering press statement,"" said Paul Delacourt, of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. ""We're talking about something no parent should ever have to go through, no high school student should ever have to worry about."" The shooting was followed by a tense and chaotic period as law enforcement tried to locate the shooter, not realizing he was among the victims. Nearby elementary schools were placed on lockdown and the LA Sheriff’s Department urged residents to “lock doors and stay inside.” Aerial footage of the scene showed law enforcement evacuating students from the 2,500-student school, leading them away from the campus in single-file, and patients being brought out on stretchers. “We didn’t know if he was behind us,” one student, accompanied by her mother, later told CNN. “We just learned to run.” Cover: A police officer stands guard as students wait to reunite with their parents following a shooting at Saugus High School that injured several people, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2019, in Santa Clarita, Calif.

There was an additional person hurt in the incident, but not shot. The victims are: Two patients remain at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, two others are at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center and one patient is at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. Of the two patients at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, one is in critical and one is in good condition, according to spokesperson Patrick Moody. From CNN's Cheri Mossburg A second victim of the shooting at Saugus High School died moments ago, Sheriff Alex Villanueva just announced. The victim was described as a 14-year-old boy. The suspect remains in grave condition with a gunshot wound to the head. A total of six victims were taken to local hospitals following the shooting at Saugus High School today, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said. Among the victims was the suspect who was seen on video shooting five people and then shooting himself in the head, Capt. Kent Wegener of Los Angeles County said. One of the victims, a 16-year-old girl, died this morning, Wegener said. Wegener provided the following details about the other victims who were injured:  A 16-year-old student was killed in today's shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, according to Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""Her parents are at the hospital,"" Wegener said. Two 14-year-old boys, a 14-year-old girl and 15-year-old student were also injured in the shooting, he said. Detectives are reviewing a video showing the moment the suspect pulled a handgun from his backpack and shot five people, according to Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The suspect then shot himself in the head, Wegener said. Authorities are working with the FBI to preserve any cell phone video that recorded the shooting, he said. Captain Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department gave more details about the shooting at Saugus High School at a press conference today. He said that the suspect's girlfriend and mother are currently talking to police. The suspect is currently at the hospital in grave condition. It was the shooting suspect's birthday today, according to Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The suspect turned 16 today, according to Wegener, and is in grave condition.  Watch here:     Speaking at a news conference, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said that six victims were taken to local hospitals following the shooting.   Former President Bill Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper today that gun laws in the US need updating following the shooting at Saugus High School that left one person dead. Clinton discussed the Brady Bill passed in Nov. 1993. The legislation required mandatory background checks for most gun purchases and the 1994 ban on semi-automatic assault weapons. During Clinton's presidency, 12 students and one teacher were killed during the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. Following that mass shooting, Clinton pushed for legislation centered on closing the so-called ""gun show loophole."" That passed the Republican-controlled Senate by a single vote, but with support from just six GOP senators. The effort died in the House when just 15% of Republicans, who by then held the majority in that chamber as well, supported the decisive amendment. Clinton shared some words of comfort for the students and families and how schools should ""do everything they possibly can to minimize this.""

Yet, 20 years after Columbine, the United States is still looking for how to stop mass public shootings. The rest of the world, where mass public shootings are actually much more common, is also looking for solutions. Russia, France, Finland, and Norway are among the European countries that have experienced far more deaths per capita from these attacks. Change is coming, if slowly, in the United States. Earlier this year Florida and Texas passed major improvements to their laws that are significantly increasing the number of teachers with guns at school. Both bills received strong support from those states’ Republican governors. Florida’s bill removed a limitation that only allowed non-classroom-based teachers to defend the classroom. Texas removed the cap on the number of school personnel that can carry firearms at schools. It isn’t by coincidence that every mass public shooting in Europe since at least 1990 has occurred in an area where general, law-abiding citizens are banned from carrying firearms for protection, and for recent mass public shootings in New Zealand, Brazil, and the Netherlands. That has also held true for 94% of such attacks in the U.S. since 1950. Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group funded by Michael Bloomberg, argues that the bills in Texas and Florida “would make school a much more dangerous place for our children.” By contrast, President Trump keeps proposing arming teachers and staff at schools, saying: “I’m telling you that would work.” But 20 states currently allow teachers and staff to carry guns to varying degrees on school property, so we don’t need to guess about how safe these schools are. Some states have had these rules for decades. In recent decades, only California and Rhode Island have moved to be more restrictive. The Crime Prevention Research Center, of which I am the president, has just released a new report looking at all the school shootings of any type in the United States from 2000 through 2018. During these years, Utah, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and parts of Oregon allowed all permitted teachers and staff to carry, without any additional training requirements.  Other states leave it to the discretion of the local superintendent or school board. As of December 2018, teachers carried in more than 30 percent of Texas school districts. And in September 2018, Ohio teachers were carrying in over 200 school districts. Roughly 5 percent of Utah teachers carry permitted concealed handguns at school, according to Clark Aposhian, the senior member of Utah's Concealed Firearm Review Board. Support staff — including janitors, librarians, secretaries, and lunch staff — carry at a higher estimated rate of between 10 and 12 percent. Carrying in a school is no different than in a grocery store, movie theater, or restaurant.  Seventeen million Americans have concealed handgun permits — which is 8.75 percent of the adult population outside of permit-unfriendly California and New York. Nobody knows whether the person next to them might have a gun, unless it happens to be needed. We found 306 cases of gunshots on school property, 48 of which were suicides. Not counting suicides, 193 people died and 267 were injured in these incidents. Four cases were simply instances of accidental gunshots by police officers. The rate of shootings and people killed by them has increased significantly since 2000. The yearly average number of people who died between 2001 and 2008 versus 2009 and 2018 has doubled (regardless of whether one excludes gang fights and suicides). This increase has occurred entirely among schools that don’t let teachers carry guns. Outside of suicides or gang violence in the wee hours of the morning, there has yet to be a single case of someone being wounded or killed from a shooting at a school that allows teachers and staff to carry guns during school hours. Indeed, the one shooting occurred at 2:20 AM in a parking lot when no armed teachers would have been around. There haven't been any serious accidents. No student has ever got a hold of their teacher’s gun, and the one accidental discharge by a teacher occurred outside of school hours. The teacher had only very minor injuries. School insurance premiums haven‘t risen at all from teachers being allowed to carry. “From what I’ve seen in Utah, [school insurance] rates have not gone up because of guns being allowed,” says Curt Oda, former president of the Utah Association of Independent Insurance Agents.  Nor has a survey of six other states shown any increase in insurance costs. Police are important, but they can't be everywhere at once.  Even if an officer is stationed at the school, mass public shooters are most likely to target the officer first. We’ve seen this time and again at malls, nightclubs, and schools. This also makes the job of the police much safer. Concealed carry means that killers won't know who is armed. Even if they take an officer by surprise, they must worry that they are revealing their position to someone else who can stop them. Not a single person has been injured or killed by a teacher’s gun. But even more amazing, not a single person has been shot during school hours. Gun control groups may paint fearful pictures of what might go wrong with teachers carrying, but that fear gets harder to push given these programs’ successes. This research provides evidence that armed teachers deter attacks. It is past time for us to do something that really works. With another mass public shooting in California, it is time for California to recognize that its gun control laws might actually be part of the problem. Let’s stop leaving our schoolchildren as sitting ducks. * Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author most recent of “The War of Guns.” Townhall.com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis.

        Kadia Goba Reporting From Washington, DC Reporting From Washington, DC Posted on November 14, 2019, at 4:47 p.m. ET Sen. Chris Murphy WASHINGTON — Sen. Chris Murphy attempted to pass a gun control package Thursday morning, watched it get blocked by Republicans, and then gave a speech about the need to do something about the regular mass shootings in America. He didn’t know until he walked out that another mass shooting had just happened, this time at a high school in California. “I found out as soon as I walked off the floor,” Murphy told BuzzFeed News. Two students were killed and several others were injured when a 16-year-old went on a shooting spree at a school in Santa Clarita on Thursday morning. Murphy had asked for the Senate to unanimously agree to pass universal background checks for firearms, as he’s done repeatedly for months. “The American public are not going to accept silence from the body week after week, month after month in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening in this country,” he said. But even after news of the shooting spread through the Senate — Sen. Richard Blumenthal found out via a note from a staffer while he was giving a speech about gun violence — Murphy said he doesn’t believe it will change anything. “I wish this weren’t the case, but Republicans’ interest in working on guns is driven by casualties of 15 or more. It’s so awful that it works like this,” he said. “I don’t doubt that we’ll be back in a conversation about background checks, but it probably won’t happen until there’s another epic-scale shooting.” Some Republicans have long opposed the bill, arguing that universal background checks violate Second Amendment rights. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican who objected to Murphy trying to get a vote on the bill Thursday morning, argued that the legislation “should not be fast-tracked by the Senate.” “Many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it’s forced upon law-abiding gun owners,"" Hyde-Smith said. In September, House Democrats advanced three additional gun bills following mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, which left a total of 31 people dead. There was also momentum toward a bipartisan gun control package negotiated with the White House. But Murphy said he hadn’t heard from the Trump administration about background checks since September. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there is bipartisan support for one part of a gun control package — a grant program that encourages states to set up “red flag” programs that allow law enforcement officers to preemptively seize a person’s firearms if they are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. But he said progress on background checks has stalled, and blamed, in part, the House impeachment inquiry. “Impeachment has sucked all the oxygen out. But I hope we will revisit. I really do. I am ready to do something yesterday,” said Graham. The House passed universal background checks in late February. The bill received bipartisan support with eight Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for the legislation. Since then, universal background checks have remained stalled in the Republican-led Senate at the behest of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Attorney General Bill Barr blamed the House impeachment hearings for derailing the progress on gun control during an event in Tennessee on Wednesday. But Murphy refuted those claims Thursday morning. “That’s not true,” Murphy said, addressing Barr’s comments on the Senate floor. “The impeachment proceedings right now are in the House of Representatives; the discussion on the future of the background checks bill was in the Senate.” Paul McLeod is a politics reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.

Email address:  The Real News Network  The Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hatewatch report on the leaked emails of Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller shows the deep connections he has to racist white nationalists. MARC STEINER: Welcome, everybody, to The Real News Network. I’m Marc Steiner. Good to have you with us. Stephen Miller is a leading policy advisor to Donald Trump. He may also be the direct link between the White House and the white nationalist movement in this country. The Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hate Watch reviewed over 900 emails between Miller and the editors of the right-wing news organization, Breitbart. They were leaked by their former editor, Katie McHugh, who they fired. So I guess you have to be aware of who you fire. In those emails, he pushed a white nationalist agenda, like setting up camps that separate children from families, banning Muslims from certain countries, selling arrest quotas for the undocumented in our country, and more. Now, the white nationalist influence, if not in control of the White House, may be much more real than we admit. And we will explore some of that. We are joined by Michael Edison Hayden, who is Senior Investigative Reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hate Watch. In addition to investigating the Stephen Miller emails, he exposed the identity of a white nationalist organizer working within the State Department in August and published A Guide to Open Source Intelligence reporting for Columbia University’s Tow Center in June. And Jared Holt joins us. He’s an investigative reporter with Right Wing Watch. He wrote our article on this investigation, called Leaked Information Reveals the Extent of Stephen Miller’s Extremism and the Grand Old Party’s Moral Rot.” Right Wing Watch is part of the advocacy group People for the American Way, and he specializes there in researching and reporting extremist right-wing movements in our country. And good to have you both with us. So welcome. So let me start, Michael, with you, and the background to this just very quickly–how this began. And this was true, right, that the woman who he initially had the email conversations with at Breitbart… Stephen Miller, the woman he talked with, quit, or was fired, I should say, and leaked these emails to you all. Is that right? MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Well there was a significant amount of time between when McHugh was let go by Breitbart and when I received the emails. I mean, she was let go in the spring of 2017 after publishing some tweets that were widely perceived to be Islamophobic. And McHugh went into a period of self-examination, I guess is the way she portrayed it to me. And she passed along emails to me in June of this year, and I was pretty shocked about what I saw. MARC STEINER: So I mean, I’m just very curious–we’ll return to Jared here in a moment–when you said you were shocked. I mean, talk a bit about when you first received these emails; you saw this unfolding. What do you mean, shocked? Shocked how? MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Well, I mean, my main focus is not to cover the administration. My main focus is to cover white nationalism, to cover the Neo-Nazi movement, particularly the online sectors of extremism. That’s where my background lies. And I didn’t go into it saying, “Oh, I’m going to do something about Stephen Miller. Stephen Miller is a white nationalist,” or anything like that. I was handed this material. The first thing I was shown was that he shared a link to a white nationalist website, and said, “Does that interest you?” And I said, “Yes, it does, because this is very familiar to me.” And when I began to look at it, there’s a level of shock in seeing patterns that were very familiar to me, having covered extremists who are the type of extremists that are not welcome to have a voice almost in polite society, I mean, people who are frequently suspended from social media and things like that, to see those types of patterns of language being used by somebody who is widely regarded to be the most influential advisor the president has. MARC STEINER: So Jared, how shocked were you by this when you first read it? What was your take? JARED HOLT: My take is that we’ve known Stephen Miller has had past interactions with this movement before. He’s certainly advocated for policies that many people would perceive to be racist and unfair to immigrants trying to enter this country. But what Michael’s reporting showed was him in his own words, and I think that carries a lot of weight on itself. It’s one of those situations where you could listen to experts, you could listen to people making allegations, or you could just see him, in his own words, expressing what he believes. And I think that is crucial reporting that Michael was able to bring to the public’s attention. MARC STEINER: All right. Let’s get to the heart of what happens in some of these. There’s just one email I’m going to pull out here from the report that I read from the Southern Poverty Law. And I understand, just to be clear, Michael, there are other reports, as you alluded to in the article, at the end, there’s more coming out. So this is just the beginning, and we will be covering this with some intensity here. So in this one email, Breitbart is saying that they are going to do a series of stories on non-white SAT scores, to break it down. It says, “It’s easier for people to digest it that way and change their minds.” Miller writes back, “On the education angle? Makes sense. Also, you see the Pope saying West must, in effect, get rid of borders. Someone should point out the parallels to the Camp of the Saints.” Let me stop there for a moment. So when I read that line in your article, Michael… First of all, let’s talk about the Camp of the Saints, what this book was. And there’s more about this as it’s unfolding, as I read the other emails. This is not like some sci-fi novel that we all love to read. This is a book that was a cornerstone of some of the most right-wing racist movements in Europe. MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Yeah. This book is… From my perspective, you put this thing on your bookshelf, you’re generally making a statement. Either you’re an extremism reporter or, more often than not, you’re an extremist. It’s not the type of thing that you see people reading in public, on a public transit or whatever. The book is scathingly racist and dehumanizes non-whites in a way that is truly grotesque. There is an Indian character, and he sort of leads a flotilla of refugees into France, and he’s called a “turd eater,” and he eats literal human feces. And basically, he and the rest of these brown-skinned refugees come into France, and when they get there, they overtake the population gradually. There’s a part in the book where a white woman is raped to death basically, by refugees. The refugees are depicted as inherently savage and subhuman. And it’s dystopian in the same way that the 1987 film Robocop is dystopian, but the message of that is the one about public works being privatized. This is a message that refugees, or people from the developing world, are going to come here and completely destroy your country and destroy what you perceive to be your homeland. And it’s not surprising that it has been … It was immediately picked up by white nationalists. I mean, the publisher who issues the book in the United States is a white nationalist publisher who we list, Hate Watch lists in that respect on our website. MARC STEINER: So pick up on that, Jared. I mean, when you look at someone like Stephen Miller, who is clearly creating some of the most significant policies around immigration and more in our country and is at the right hand of Donald Trump… So talk a bit about what you think; how deep this goes and what that means. JARED HOLT: Well, as far as the Camp of the Saints thing goes, I have seen some pushback from people who would like to defend Miller. They’ve said, “It’s not a crime to read a book.” But I think that sort of misses the point here. What Stephen Miller was doing was indicating that he was familiar with the contents of the book, and then suggesting a right-wing publisher to further the contents of that book to a right-wing audience, under the guise of some sort of political analysis. So that is indicative to me of a pattern that represents what is likely Steven Miller’s agenda, which is to be a part of the Republican movement under Trump and to usher in policies that are adjacent, in the very least, to the goals of white nationalism. MARC STEINER: Let’s wrestle with this one question for a moment. Racism and antisemitism run very deep in our world. And racism in this country is one of our greatest social diseases and most everybody is infected by it at some level. So we’re not talking about somebody who may have some racist ideas who works in the government. We’re talking here, Michael, about people who are part of a white nationalist movement who are virulent racists, who live by their racism. And they’re at the heart of the White House here. This is a pretty frightening scenario. I mean, this is different than having a conservative or a liberal deciding what policy is. We’re talking about people who–for want of a better term–in the old days might’ve been called a fascist, at the top. MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Yeah. I think the best way to frame this–the best way to look at it, in my opinion–is to understand that, yeah, there’s garden variety racism. There’s the stereotype of your uncle or whatever at the Thanksgiving table, this sort of thing, right, that people bat around. And then there’s a difference between organized racism and trying to organize society around racist ideas. And that’s a huge difference. It makes a huge difference to us because we’re not interested policing people based upon the fact that they use slurs. We are interested in people who want to restructure society and have ambitions to restructure society in broad ways. And then if you look at some of the policies that the Trump administration has enacted, I’ll give you one example here, in the emails, there’s one where he shares a link to VDARE, which is a white nationalist website. And they sort of support the sort of white genocide myth, this idea that whites are being systematically eliminated or whatever. He shares that in the context of temporary protective status for refugees. He’s like, “Here, read this,” and to a very young reporter, who was only 10 months out of college, he says, “Read this. Why don’t you read this as your guide?” And I think that that says volumes about our changing policies around temporary protective status, because we have, the United States has removed the ability to protect refugees from, after natural disasters, from a number of countries that are predominantly non-white. And in doing that, you can see a connection between Miller sharing this email, “This is my reference point,” and then, here we are, and the president of the United States and the people around him are acting on it. MARC STEINER: And I’m not one who tries to be an alarmist all the time, and I try to look at things kind of objectively and analytically, but Jared, when you heard what Michael just said, and you look at, there’s one quote that came out of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which was, when they talked to Katie McHugh, the woman who released these emails, who was the editor of Breitbart before, and the quote was, “What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration,” which is what Michael was just describing here. But I mean, this is, I think, politically, when you look at what could be unfolding here, I mean, this is where the danger lives, that the–go ahead. JARED HOLT: I totally agree. I mean, in 2016, when the alt right, as it would come to be known, essentially a reboot of the white nationalist movement, was gaining foothold in the United States and galvanizing around Trump’s campaign, the biggest hope that they had was that one day they would have government officials, people at the highest levels, that read their podcasts, that read their blogs, that thought the way that they do. And these emails from around that era of the alt-right indicate that Stephen Miller was one of those people. And now Stephen Miller is one of the most, probably, if not the most influential policy voice in the Trump White House. And that is reason for huge alarm, in my opinion. MARC STEINER: If you look at what Miller is doing; he’s playing this very close to the vest. He’s really very shrewd and smart, cutting off all contacts with so many people because he was afraid to be exposed, not phone calls and writing again so he wouldn’t be exposed. So unearthing this, I wonder, has there been any reaction yet to your report, Michael, from the White House, from any folks in Republican Party around this? MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Well, they dismissed the report outright in a statement and said that they were… They just attacked Southern Poverty Law Center, as I expected they were going to attack their credibility. Somebody from the White House apparently insinuated to an Axios reporter that this was an antisemitic attack because Miller himself is Jewish, which I think is going to be a very difficult case to make given the reporting that I have done on overt Neo-Nazis who have ambitions of killing Jews. From what I’ve seen, they don’t really have an answer to it, other than to attack the source. And I kind of expected that. I figured they would attack. Honestly, I thought the attacks would be a lot more aggressive than they have been. I thought there’d be a lot more attacks on our character, on my character, and things like that. I think that there’s just no way for them to claim that the emails are not real. They’re real. He sent them. MARC STEINER: Exactly. And I’m sure the attacks will become more forceful in the coming week. But as we conclude here, one of the things, Jared, that you wrote in the end of your article; your quote was, “That a figure like Miller could rise in the ranks of the GOP and be normalized in the American press is indicative of the moral rot of the Republican Party and a failure of the nation’s largest mass media networks to address Miller as what he is, a white nationalist at the heart of power in a GOP administration.” Well, let me just ask you both to wrestle with that comment, and let you start since you wrote that, Jared. I mean, we’ve talked about this on the air before. The number of people who are virulently racist and part of this national movement are in the White House. They’re in the executive branch. How deep does it go? How worried should America be about what we’re looking at, or are we being overly concerned? JARED HOLT: Well, I think the point of history that we’re in right now is the result of a system that has ultimately faulted. I do not think that this is indicative of a healthy, functioning democracy, that figures like Miller, figures like Trump himself even, can rise to the level of power that they have and receive institutional support from the mainline GOP, and also from an institutionalized press that pretends that this is just another side of a normal political debate. What we’re fighting for, ultimately, is our political future for the next set of decades. And I do think that it’s interesting to see if mainstream media, if our major networks, are going to wrestle with this story and treat it as seriously as I believe it is. MARC STEINER: I think it’s a very serious story to wrestle with. Michael, how do you respond to that? MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: I mean, I agree with what Jared is saying. The only thing I would add about this is it seems that Miller has gotten a tremendous amount of cover from the fact that Steve Bannon was removed. And people, I think began to turn away from the possibility that the extreme far right was influencing Trump in some way, just because Bannon went. And then Miller was always this character who was lurking in the background. And then every time he would show up on Fox and whatever else, it would come up again, people would just be like, “Oh, there’s Stephen Miller again,” in the back of their heads. But if you remember what happened with Steve Bannon; I know Southern Poverty Law Center launched a petition, for example, and other people did, to draw attention to his beliefs and things like that. And it wasn’t until after Charlottesville, it was one week after Charlottesville that Bannon was resigned from his post, and did so, you know, just went quietly into the night. It would be a shame if we have to wait for a similar Charlottesville-like event or a mass shooting for them to respond by removing Miller. And he’s really gotten away with being there for years, whereas Bannon was removed relatively quickly. MARC STEINER: And as I said before, Miller plays it very smart. He’s not like Bannon, he doesn’t kind of come out and be… He’s not vociferous like Bannon. He’s not a media hog like Bannon. MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: I will add one detail. MARC STEINER: Go ahead. MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: I think is important to add about that. We have Bannon talking about Camp of the Saints, which I think was the big scandal which sort of unearthed like, “Wow, what does he really believe?” And the first time, I think publicly that Bannon ever mentioned Camp of the Saints was in October of 2015. And the reason why that is very significant is because the first time that Miller mentions Camp of the Saints in his emails was one month prior to that. And then Julia Hahn writes a story that adheres very similarly to the pitch that Miller was making to Katie McHugh. Julia Hahn works at the White House as an aide, by the way, now. And then a few days later, Bannon mentions Camp of the Saints in a radio interview with Jeff Sessions, who’s Miller’s boss. So if Camp of the Saints was too toxic for Bannon, where did Bannon start talking about it? And we have another thing about Camp of the Saints as well, which is that, prior to Miller mentioning it, on VDARE, a white nationalist website, they had a literal story tag “Camp of the Saints.” So anything that was about refugees was tagged–or not anything, but most of the things were tagged with “Camp of the Saints” on it. So I mean, you just see a pathway directly… And Daily Stormer, which is a Neo-Nazi website, was writing on Camp of the Saints. So you have this pathway from these white nationalist hate sites directly to Session’s office and to Breitbart. Then it gets a megaphone to the entire country, and next thing you know, Miller, Bannon, and Julia Hahn, they’re all in the White House. MARC STEINER: And on that note, we’ll stop and contemplate all that. And in the coming week, as more comes out, we look forward to having you both back, and to talk about this in some depth as this unfolds. It’s really important work you’re doing, Michael Edison Hayden. We appreciate the work that you’re putting out there. And Jared Holt, your investigative work in Right Wing Watch is also incredible. And it’s good to have this out there. We need to be able to wrestle with this in an honest way to see what we’re facing. Gentlemen, thank you so much for both joining us. And I look forward to talking more as this unfolds. MICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN: Thanks, Mark. JARED HOLT: Thanks for having us. MARC STEINER: And I’m Marc Steiner here for The Real News Network.

        Stephanie K. Baer Reporting From Santa Clarita, California Reporting From Santa Clarita, California Last updated on November 15, 2019, at 8:04 p.m. ET Posted on November 14, 2019, at 6:56 p.m. ET Students are comforted as they wait to be reunited with their parents following a shooting at Saugus High School. SANTA CLARITA, California — Terrified students barricaded themselves inside classrooms, some arming themselves with scissors on hand, as gunshots rang out at a high school near Los Angeles on Thursday morning. ""A lot of people grabbed scissors, just to prepare in case we had to fight back,"" Ember Miller, a student at Saugus High School, told the local NBC affiliate. Other students, many of whom had just arrived on campus to start their school day, said they scrambled before they could even confirm that the loud bangs echoing through the school were coming from a gun. Abandoned bags and backpacks could be seen on the ground around the high school in aerial footage from local stations, belongings left behind in the rush of students trying to escape. Two students were killed and three others were injured after a 16-year-old shooter opened fire in the quad at Saugus High School, authorities said. The shooter, identified by public records and local news reports as Nathaniel Berhow, pulled the handgun from his backpack, shot five students, and then shot himself in the head with the last bullet in the weapon. Berhow, who turned 16 on Thursday, died Friday afternoon while being treated at the hospital, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. ""We heard a shot and at first we thought maybe someone dropped something heavy or a balloon popped,"" a student who identified herself only as Lauren told NBC. ""We heard three more and that's when finally our brain finally went out of shock and allowed us to run, and we realized we have to get out."" Like schools across the country, Saugus High School students take part in active shooter drills where they are taught to turn off the lights in their classrooms, barricade doors, and try to protect themselves from threats. Students inside classrooms on Thursday employed some of the same survival tactics used by others who have faced campus shooters, such as stacking chairs against doors. My heart is BROKEN. Seeing backpacks scattered everywhere, hearing gunshots, crying in my friends arms not knowing if we would go home is DEVASTATING. When will this stop ?#EnoughIsEnough #GunControl HOW MANY MORE LIVES NEED TO BE TAKEN TO PROVE THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE But because most classes at the school had not yet started when gunfire rang out, many of the students were gathered outside and quickly ran from the quad looking for a place to shelter. In the panicked run, many of the students fell as they rushed looking for a safe place. Alexander Skiba, a 15-year-old first-year student, was hanging out near the band room when he heard five loud bangs. ""I saw this huge horde of people coming to the exit and just running,"" he told BuzzFeed News. ""I saw people falling down and I just went to help them get up. I picked them up and told them to go."" Then, after helping several other students get out of there, Skiba ran. ""I just booked it,"" he said. He ran all the way to a nearby Albertson's where about 15 to 20 other students had ended up. He called his dad, Brian, as he fled. ""I could hear everybody screaming in the background,"" Brian Skiba said. Skiba picked up Alexander from the store, then returned to the school to pick up his 16-year-old daughter, who was hiding in the school's band room. Kaitlin Holt, a choir teacher, told the local ABC affiliate that students ran into her classroom as shots rang out on campus. One of them was a girl who appeared to have been shot on the side of her abdomen and shoulder. ""She was hanging outside my room when everything happened and they ran into the class,"" Holt said. ""She was really strong and she was great. She was joking with me saying, 'I'm going to be homeschooled after this.'"" Eddie Mendoza, a 17-year-old senior, told BuzzFeed News that Holt barricaded the door and grabbed a first aid kit to help the wounded student. ""She immediately jumped into action,"" he said. Other students, not knowing exactly what to expect, armed themselves. ""We were using our desks, we took a bunch of big tables, ... just barricaded the door ... A lot of people grabbed scissors and prepared just in case we had to fight back,"" student Amber Miller said of the deadly #SaugusHigh shooting. https://t.co/4c5zxh7lgg ""All of a sudden my best friend, Ellie, taps me on the shoulder and she's like, 'We need to get down,'"" Miller told NBC. ""The lights turn off and I'm just sitting there thinking, Oh my god, this is happening."" Miller said after moving large tables and chairs to barricade the door, some students grabbed scissors in case there was an encounter with the shooter. ""I should not have to go to school and fear for my life,"" she said. ""It breaks my heart to know more students have to die before we realize this is an issue."" While barricaded inside classrooms, students tried to stay as quiet as possible, hoping not to attract the attention of the shooter. Julius Castillo, 16, was hiding in the music library inside the band room with about 30 other students. They were preparing for the worst when a cellphone that was left out on a music stand started to ring. It went off three times, rattling the students. ""Everyone was crying,"" Castillo said, adding that they were worried the phone would catch the shooter's attention. If the shooter did get in somehow, Castillo thought to himself, he would stand up and defend his friends. ""I thought to myself, Calm down, don't panic,"" he said. Helen Rieckhoff, a 15-year-old sophomore, was in the quad when the shooting broke out. “I first heard one shot and then everybody went dead silent,” Rieckhoff told BuzzFeed News, adding that, at that time of day, the quad is usually full of students hanging out. “It got really quiet and then we heard three more shots in a row,” she said. “It was just a giant bang. It echoed.” She was wearing Birkenstock sandals, but she kicked them off her feet and started running for cover by the time the third shot rang out. The first classroom door she tried was locked, but she and her friends quickly found another room farther away and ran inside. They locked the doors, turned out the lights, pulled down the blinds, and waited. “We all stood there — there was a lot of heavy breathing and silent crying.""

185,https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senator-finds-school-shooting-gun-control-debate,"When Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., started speaking on the floor Thursday morning, he had not yet heard about the mass shooting at a Southern California high school a little less than an hour before. During Blumenthal’s speech on gun control legislation, a staffer passed him a note alerting him to the shooting. Although he incorrectly stated that the shooting took place in Santa Clara, Calif. instead of Santa Clarita, Calif., Blumenthal quickly pointed to the massacre where two people died as a real-life example of the need for the legislation. Blumenthal was one of three senators to advocate for gun control legislation Thursday morning. Sen. Christopher S. Murphy, D-Conn., attempted to get a voice vote on H.R. 8, the House-passed gun background check bill. The unanimous consent request was rejected by Sen.

186,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/walmart-mass-shooting-el-paso-texas-mexicans,"The border city in eastern Texas continues to recover from the racially-driven attack that targeted Mexicans and killed 22 people Last modified on Fri 15 Nov 2019 02.09 GMT Three months after one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, the Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where 22 were killed in an August rampage reopened on Thursday amid tears and smiles from customers and staff as the border city continues to reel from the racially-driven tragedy. The 9am opening began with the raising of the American flag – which had been flown at half-staff since the attack – and the unfurling of an “El Paso Strong” banner, a slogan which is now found on bumper stickers, shirts and buildings throughout the city.  Inside the store, hundreds of employees lined up to greet each new customer as they arrived, while cashiers, stockers and managers hugged, cried and laughed as intermittent cheers of “Welcome to Walmart” rang out through the store. “It will take time to heal,” said El Paso resident Randy Villegas, just minutes before the store opened. “The situation was bad, but it made us strong. We’re here to show our pride and move on from that terrible day.” On 3 August, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Allen, Texas, entered the Walmart in eastern El Paso, not far from the US-Mexico border, and opened fire on shoppers with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing 22 and injuring dozens of others. Upon his arrest, Crusius confirmed he was the shooter and stated his target were “Mexicans”, according to a police affidavit. According to a racist, white nationalist rant posted online shortly before the attack and thought to have been written by the suspect, the shooting was a response to what it called the “Hispanic invasion of Texas”. “I am simply defending my country from cultural and ethnic replacement brought on by an invasion,” the author wrote on the far-right message board 8chan. Crusius pleaded not guilty last month to murder charges. He faces the death penalty if convicted. For residents of El Paso, a border city that is more than three-quarters Hispanic, the alleged racist motivations of the attack have had a profound and lingering impact. “Everyone in El Paso knew someone that was here, this touched everyone,” said Villegas, whose wife and best friend both work at the Walmart on Gateway Boulevard but were off during the day of the attack. It is thought that almost 3,000 witnesses were present during the sustained attack. “He was after people like us,” said Javier Luis, a father of three from Ciudad Juarez, El Paso’s sister city in Mexico, directly across the Rio Grande which forms the border dividing the two metropolises. Luis said he crosses into the US with his wife Maria once a month to shop at this particular Walmart branch, as do many Mexicans living near this part of the border. “We were scared to come back, but racism won’t change how we live,” he said determinedly. In the US, mass shootings have become more frequent and more deadly. The attack in El Paso was just one of 22 fatal mass shootings in the US this year alone, and of the 10 deadliest massacres in the modern US, four have occurred in Texas. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), a not-for-profit research group tracking mass shootings and gun violence, the number of mass shootings (defined by GVA as an attack where at least four people were shot) in the US has thus far outpaced the number of days in 2019. Just as the store opened, news came through of multiple people shot at a high school in Santa Clarita, in southern California. El Paso resident Miguel Arturo, who was at the Walmart reopening to get his regular consignment of groceries, specifically some avocados, he said, remarked that the city and the country could learn from such tragedies. “Who needs assault rifles?” he asked, echoing the point recently and forcefully made by local political luminary Beto O’Rourke following the El Paso shooting. O’Rourke dropped out of the 2020 presidential race just days ago, but he made his mark with gun control advocates. “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” O’Rourke said at the Democratic primary debate in September. “We’re not going to allow them to be used against fellow Americans any more.” For Villegas and others, the hope is that the re-opening of the store can be a small step towards healing and a return to normal life. “This attack does not represent our city,” said Villegas, as more and more customers poured into the store, while welcoming cheers continued to ring out from the staff. “We won’t forget, but we will move on.”",2019-11-14 19:19:25,‘This touched everyone’: Walmart store reopens months after mass shooting,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

For Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-NY), word of the Saugus High School shooting came right in the middle of his speech on the Senate floor. “We are complicit in these deaths if we fail to act,” Blumenthal said after Republicans voted to block a bill that would require universal background checks to purchase firearms. In footage of Blumenthal’s speech, a staffer then hands him a note with the news of the shooting in Santa Clarita, California, which left two students, a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, dead. A 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl, and another 14-year-old boy were also hit by the gun fire. The alleged 16-year-old shooter also shot himself in the head but remains in a critical condition. After he saw the news, Blumenthal continued: “As I speak on the floor right now, there is a school shooting in Santa [Clarita], California. How can we turn the other way? How can we refuse to see that shooting in real-time? Demanding our attention? Requiring our action?” RELATED: 2 Students — Girl, 16, and Boy, 14 — Killed in Southern California High School Shooting “We are complicit if we fail to act,” he continued in his impassioned speech. “It is not just a political responsibility, it is a moral imperative.” On Twitter after his speech, Blumenthal wrote, “As I was on the Senate floor speaking about the need for universal background checks—after Rs blocked a vote today—I heard this devastating news.” RELATED: Students Recall Chaos and Horror in California High School Shooting That Killed 2 “To the victims&families, we can’t take back the loss&fear you’re feeling, but we’ll keep fighting to end this epidemic of violence,” he added. Congressional reporter Michael McAuliff pointed out on Twitter that Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) was speaking about reasons to block universal background checks at almost the exact moment gunfire was breaking out in Santa Clarita, around 8 a.m. Pacific Time.

Some of the dozens of Saugus High School students at a vigil held in the city’s Central Park recounted how a typical day goes on their campus, and just how terrifyingly different that routine became Thursday. On most days at Saugus, juniors and seniors file into classrooms for their first period around 7 a.m.  Burning time before their first class, freshmen and sophomores gather in the school’s courtyard area, known as “the quad,” a set of picnic tables near a patch of grass, in front of the school’s counseling office. That is where students remembered watching a fellow student open fire on his peers, killing two, and injuring three others, before shooting himself. The group of mainly sophomores and freshmen scattered from the area, running either off campus or into classrooms.

(Photo by Hans Gutknecht, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG)  Anthony Donato, a sophomore, and his friends were in the quad waiting for their chemistry class. Just before the shots rang out, the group got up to take a walk when they heard a loud boom. “It was silent for a good five seconds, and you could kinda hear the contemplation of the kid who was shooting, and then you hear the next few shots and we all ran,” Donato said, while standing with his friends at Central Park. Dozens of other students, mostly freshmen and sophomores, gathered at the park to mourn the loss of their peers, and to process an experience they had only heard of on the news. “And then when it happens basically in your living room, you just kinda get shookin’ up a lot,” Donato said. After the shots rang out, Donato and his friends took a familiar shortcut. They ran to a drain pipe that runs past the edge of campus. The group crawled into the tiny space and out into a bordering neighborhood. Most of the students gathering at Central Park were on their way to school when the shooting happened. “If I was there on time, I know I would’ve been there, too,” said Larren Wells, a sophomore who had been running five minutes later than usual Thursday morning. She and her friends typically hang out at the quad before class. She turned back home once she heard of the shooting. One of her friends was 20 feet from the shooter. Wells said her friend ran through the front gate and into a neighboring home. Another friend took shelter in a classroom where she remembered seeing a girl run inside with gunshot wounds to her shoulder and upper abdomen, Wells said. A third friend was tennis teammates with one of the wounded. From her bedroom, Wells said she tried to comfort her friends through Facetime and in their group text while they waited in the darkened classrooms. “No matter what, we’re gonna carry the burden with us,” she said. Students said going back to school would be a challenge. “It won’t be normal,” Wells said. “But it’ll push us to work harder and the school will be more safe now.” “It’s never going to be the same,” said Santiago Pilar, also a sophomore. “When we go to the spot (the quad), we’re just gonna think about what happened. It’s just gonna bring bad vibes.” Other students spoke of fear. “I guess you have to be more mindful, how we defend ourselves, or how our days are gonna be,” said Karl Sevilla, a sophomore who wore his ROTC uniform. “Cause whatever is gonna come to that door next, we’ll never know; it could be a student, it could be another shooter.” The park where students gathered Thursday evening sits several blocks from the high school.Still an active crime scene, the school campus remained roped off by yellow crime scene tape, and  Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigators stood watch next to their patrol cars along the roads leading to the campus.

191,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/15/20-years-given-in-17-slaying-of-teen-in/,"The 21-year-old Conway man authorities say sparked the July 2017 mass shooting at a downtown Little Rock club has pleaded guilty to killing the 14-year-old son of a drug dealer who claimed to use the money he made to fund youth programs in the city. Tyler Clay Jackson pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and robbery in exchange for a 20-year prison sentence from Pulaski County Circuit Judge Herb Wright, according to sentencing papers filed Wednesday by deputy prosecutor Amanda Fields. Under the plea deal negotiated by his public defender, Cheryl Barnard, the charges were reduced from capital murder and aggravated robbery. Jackson, already imprisoned for fleeing and aggravated-assault convictions in Faulkner County, will have to serve 14 years before he can qualify for parole. Cyncere Alexander was found shot dead in his father's home in the Pleasant Pointe apartments on Green Mountain Drive. Neighbors described hearing five to six gunshots. His killers left empty-handed. Police said a bag holding about 2 pounds of marijuana was found nearby. Three other men are charged in the slaying, one of them a former friend of the boy's father. The teen's slaying came three weeks after more than two dozen people were injured in a late-night shootout during a rap concert at the Power Ultra Lounge at Sixth and Center streets. No one was killed in what was one of the nation's largest mass shootings that year. The club was immediately closed. The display of resurgent gang violence in Little Rock prompted Gov. Asa Hutchison to establish a task force combining local, state and federal authorities. The resulting investigation produced more than 50 federal indictments and led to the club performer, Ricky ""Finesse2Tymes"" Hampton of Memphis, and his bodyguard, Kentrell ""Dirt"" Gwynn, also of Memphis, going to prison for 10 years on state and federal gun charges. Jackson, who was one of the first people arrested in the Power Ultra shooting, is accused of firing the first shot while targeting a rival gang member. He still faces two counts of second-degree battery and 10 counts of aggravated assault over the shootout. The charges together carry a maximum sentence of 72 years. His next court appearance is set for Wednesday. Cyncere Alexander's father, Chris Lamont Alexander, now 43, had drawn city support -- including an endorsement from the police chief and the city manager -- for proclaiming his past as a gang member was behind him and helping set up a youth advocacy program intended to discourage young people from following in his footsteps, which included stints in state and federal prisons. But by the time Cyncere Alexander, the youngest of his five children, was killed, the senior Alexander's do-gooder facade was crumbling. About a month before the slaying, Chris Alexander was arrested after leading police on a chase that reached speeds over 100 mph and caused an officer to crash. That arrest eventually led to a six-year prison sentence. Three months after the chase, police disrupted his marijuana-dealing operation at a carwash on Daisy L. Gatson Bates Drive where Alexander ran a car-detailing business and a storefront in Jacksonville. Alexander, whose street name is Murda or Murder, subsequently pleaded guilty to federal gun and marijuana charges and was sent to prison for 10 years. He said he got involved in marijuana trafficking to help fund his youth program. Alexander's sentencing date fell a week before the second anniversary of his son's death. He told the judge ""jealousy and greed is what took my son's life."" Alexander said Cyncere ""was killed at a place [where] he should have been safe."" But authorities say Cyncere Alexander, known to friends and associates as ""'Lil Badass,"" was in danger because he got caught in the middle of a dispute between his father and one of the man's friends, Machita Mitchell Jr., both members of the Wolfe Street Crips, in a falling out over their marijuana dealings that has not been publicly made clear. Mitchell, known as ""Frog,"" was locked up on marijuana-trafficking charges when the teen died. Court filings show investigators, monitoring the 43-year-old defendant in jail, have recordings of phone conversations, one of them conducted about an hour before the teenager was killed. In that recording, Mitchell and another co-defendant in the murder case, Kenwan Sherrod, can be heard discussing sending Jackson to Chris Alexander's apartment to steal marijuana, even if Jackson had to take the contraband from the teenager by force. The morning after the boy's slaying, Mitchell and Sherrod speak again, with the younger man telling Mitchell that Cyncere Alexander was dead. Asked by Mitchell whether anything was taken from the apartment, Sherrod says that nothing was taken, court filings show. Authorities say the 23-year-old Sherrod is Mitchell's protege. Mitchell and Sherrod are not charged in the club shootout but the men were already on the police's radar when Cyncere Alexander was killed. Witness statements had indicated that the two were in the club, and that Mitchell gave Jackson a pistol and Sherrod urged him to use it on Jackson's rival. Mitchell has been jailed since his arrest four days after the club shooting after a raid at his home where police seized two guns, 84 pounds of marijuana and $23,700, which included 72 $100 bills and $15,640 in $20 bills. The raid led to indictments, with Mitchell pleading guilty to federal marijuana and gun charges last month. A sentencing date is pending. Sherrod was arrested in May 2018 after being indicted in the same marijuana case. The men were subsequently charged with capital murder and aggravated robbery in Cyncere Alexander's death in July 2018. The third defendant is 21-year-old Keterrioun Chandler of North Little Rock, who told police that he had driven Jackson to the apartment complex where the Alexanders lived, knowing that Jackson planned to rob someone. According to police testimony, Chandler said he waited in the car while Jackson went into the apartment. Chandler said he heard shots and that Jackson returned to the car empty-handed, saying he couldn't find anything to steal. Jackson told him he had shot Cyncere Alexander because he thought the teen had a gun, Chandler told police. Chandler said he sent Jackson back into the apartment for a second search but when Jackson still couldn't find anything to take, Chandler drove them away. Both Chandler and Sherrod are in jail.

The suspect in Thursday's deadly shooting at a California high school died on Friday, police told the Associated Press. After shooting five students — two fatally — the suspect turned the gun on himself and had been in critical condition. The suspect has been identified as a ""quiet"" Boy Scout who turned 16 on the day of the attack, according to multiple reports. The shooting suspect has been identified as Nathaniel Berhow, the Los Angeles Times and CNN report, citing unnamed law-enforcement sources. He turned 16 on Thursday, the Associated Press said. The police have not publicly identified the shooter because he's a minor, the AP said. The shooting, which left two students dead and three others injured, took place at about 7:30 a.m. local time Thursday at Saugus High School in the Santa Clarita Valley, north of Los Angeles. The gunman then shot himself in the head, authorities said. He was taken to a hospital and died on Friday, the Associated Press reported. The entire incident took place in just 16 seconds, officials said. Surveillance videos showed the suspect pulling a .45-caliber handgun from his backpack and shooting the students before turning the gun on himself, the Los Angeles Times reported Sheriff Alex Villanueva as saying. Neither a motive for the shooting nor any relationship between the suspect and victims is clear. There has been no indication that the suspect had been acting on behalf of a particular ideology or group, the AP reported the police as saying. Multiple people who grew up with the suspect have described him as unassuming and said they did not expect him to be capable of such violence. His friends called him Nathan, CNN reported. Brooke Risley, a junior at Saugus High who had known the suspect since elementary school, described him to the AP as ""naturally smart"" and introverted, though open to his close friends. She also said he wasn't bullied, had a girlfriend, and was active in his Boy Scout team. Detectives interviewed the suspect's girlfriend and his mother at a Santa Clarita police station shortly after the shooting, The New York Times reported, citing Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Joe Fitzpatrick, a senior at the school, also called him a ""good, quiet kid"" who did well academically, the AP reported. Ryan McCracken, a neighbor who had grown up with Berhow, told the AP the suspect was ""a quiet, to-himself kid"" and said: ""You wouldn't expect anything like that from him."" Brizio DelRosario, who ran with Berhow on a junior varsity cross-country team, also told CNN that Berhow was ""totally normal"" and not a ""weird kid."" ""The last time I saw him was at a race about two weeks ago, he was totally normal,"" DelRosario said. ""I started next to him and he wished me luck."" Another friend of Berhow, who asked not to be named, told CNN that he knew Berhow had access to guns and had grown up around them but that nobody had worried because he was responsible and knew how to use them. The friend also described Berhow's mother as ""the sweetest woman I've ever met,"" CNN reported. Another neighbor told the Los Angeles Times that the family ""were wonderful, wonderful people."" Jared Axen, a neighbor of the family, told the Los Angeles Times that Berhow's father used to hunt elk and that the Berhow would occasionally tag along on those trips. Axen added that he and the younger Berhow sometimes shot cans with air pistols and two weeks ago had spoken briefly about the teen's plans to go to college. Berhow's father died of a sudden heart attack at home in December 2017, according to an online obituary. He was a licensed pilot and ""loved big game hunting and fishing of all kinds,"" the obituary said. The younger Berhow had been heavily affected by the death, CNN reported a neighbor as saying. In 2015, Berhow's father was arrested on suspicion of attempted battery on a spouse, but authorities eventually declined to charge him because of insufficient evidence, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Former President Bill Clinton, the last president to face impeachment, has some advice for President Donald Trump as he faces his own impeachment battle: Get on with your day job. ""My message was — would be: Look, you got hired to do a job,"" Clinton told CNN's Jake Tapper in a phone interview that aired Thursday. ""You don't get the days back you blow off. Every day is an opportunity to make something good happen. ""And I would say, 'I've got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry, and they should just have at it. Meanwhile, I'm going to work for the American people,'"" he continued. ""That's what I would do."" Clinton is in a unique position to offer insights to the incumbent, having been only the second president in US history to be impeached. In 1999, after a five-week Senate trial, Clinton was acquitted of charges of perjury and obstruction relating to his affair with a 21-year-old White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. On Wednesday, the first House impeachment hearings since Clinton's opened in the Capitol, when two senior State Department officials testified about Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden. Trump has been accused of abusing his power in seeking the investigations and withholding military aid as leverage. Trump won the presidency in 2016 after a bruising contest with Clinton's wife, Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state. So far, Trump does not appear to be taking the route advocated by Bill Clinton. He has refused to work with congressional Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry and launched social-media attacks on key witnesses and Democrats. Clinton, who phoned in to CNN to discuss the shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita, California, on Thursday, criticized Attorney General William Barr's claim that the impeachment inquiry was stalling attempts to pass bipartisan legislation on things like gun control. ""Well, my answer is: Look at how much we got done in 1998 to 1999, and even in 1997. We had very productive actions in all three years,"" Clinton said, adding that government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 after Republican congressional gains were the only real points where legislative pushes stalled.",2019-11-15 08:58:01,"Bill Clinton, the last president to get impeached, told Trump that his best bet is to ignore it and get on with his job",,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

Experts weigh in on what it really means to be a ‘Second Amendment sanctuary’ after Lake County became the first county in Florida to pass a resolution declaring itself a ‘Second Amendment Sanctuary’ in support of gun rights. The Lake County Commission in central Florida recently became the first county in the state to pass a resolution declaring itself a ""Second Amendment sanctuary"" in support of gun rights. Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel & policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told Fox News that the resolution is illusory. “The Lake County Commission’s resolution is purely a political symbolic gesture that doesn't really have any legal weight whatsoever,” said Skaggs. “It’s really important to understand the lack of significance of what they’ve done here.” Ordinances, unlike resolutions, have the force of law, but in Florida, counties and municipalities are prohibited from adopting ordinances on guns. Florida’s statewide law says that only state legislatures can create laws that have to do with firearms. “It says basically that we are not going to do anything to harm the Second Amendment, that we stand behind the Second Amendment in every way, manner, shape, and form. That's the way that I wish every county in Florida would respond.” The last major gun legislation passed in Florida occurred after the mass shooting in Parkland when the state legislature passed a package of gun safety bills that included an extreme risk protection law, a higher minimum age for buying firearms, and stronger waiting periods. Jon Gutmacher, a retired Florida lawyer and author of “Florida Firearms — Law, Use & Ownership,” told Fox News that he thinks the precedent set by the Lake County Commission is an important example for other counties across the state to follow. FLORIDA COUNTY FIRST IN STATE TO ENACT 'SECOND AMENDMENT SANCTUARY' IN SUPPORT OF GUN RIGHTS “It says basically that we are not going to do anything to harm the Second Amendment, that we stand behind the Second Amendment in every way, manner, shape, and form,” said Gutmacher. “That's the way that I wish every county in Florida would respond.” Marie Bogdonoff, a Lake County resident, said that the local leaders were speaking to their constituents through the resolution. “The fact that Lake County is now going to be a sanctuary county for gun owners is probably good news for the community,” explained Bogdonoff. “In this community, we have a high number of veterans and gun owners, and they treasure their guns and so they would not look very favorably to having someone confiscate their guns.” DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN BLAMES MCCONNELL FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SHOOTING Skaggs acknowledged the fear that many hold of having their guns confiscated, but stressed that gun seizures could not lawfully occur. “It's important to note that there is no federal law that requires confiscation of anybody's guns in Lake County or anywhere else,” said Skaggs. “And so this isn't really a question of whether there is a federal law that this meaningless gesture is attempting to fight against. It's really just taking a stand in terms of political debate.” CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Sarasota County Commissioner Christian Ziegler has followed Lake County’s cue and is pushing to make Sarasota the next Florida county to become a Second Amendment sanctuary.

In 2018, Castle Rock introduced the idea of a series that took inspiration from King (setting, tone, a few known characters, a sprinkling of Easter eggs) but wasn’t actually an adaptation of a specific book or story. Season one focused on the past and present of a troubled family, the Deavers, whose lives became entangled with Castle Rock’s most mysterious elements—including interdimensional portals and the quietly menacing young man found hidden in the sub-basement of Shawshank Prison. Was “the Kid” (played by Bill Skarsgård, whose role as Pennywise in the King-adapted It added some meta-context) someone who’d been displaced from his own timeline after taking a wrong turn in the woods, or was he, as one character declared, the Devil himself? Season one left a lot of plot points ambiguous, including the Kid’s true identity, but he  was back in his Shawshank hole by the finale. Castle Rock just dropped its season finale, “Romans.” Did we get an explanation for every aspect of Castle Rock is billed as an anthology show, and accordingly, season two has so far made only passing references to the events we saw in season one. For instance, a TV playing in the background lets us know that Shawshank, which closed after season one’s many terrible events (including the warden’s suicide, the subsequent discovery of the Kid, the other warden’s suicide, and a mass shooting perpetrated by one of the guards), has recently re-opened. The town landmarks remain the same, like the Mellow Tiger Bar and the big white church. But most of the faces are completely new, and quite a bit of season two takes place in the town next door: Jerusalem’s Lot. King fans will immediately assume that means vampires, but season two of Castle Rock—which is shaping up to be far more overtly supernatural and horror-oriented than season one—looks to be putting its own spin on the monsters in its midst. Annie Wilkes/Anne Ingalls (Lizzy Caplan): The hook for season two is that it provides an origin story for Misery’s psychotic literary fan, or at least a version of her. Here, she’s in her 30s, a nurse who keeps a handle on her psychotic tendencies, including distressing hallucinations, with a precise combination of self-prescribed drugs. She gets stuck in Castle Rock with her 16-year-old daughter, Joy, after a car accident, and decides to stay when Nadia, a doctor at the local hospital, promises to supply her with the meds she needs to feel sane. Even more of Annie’s backstory—including her lonely childhood and her mother’s suicide by driving into a lake (with Annie in the car)—is revealed in the flashback-driven fifth episode, “The Laughing Place.” As it turns out, Joy is actually Annie’s half-sister. Annie kidnapped her after flying into a rage and accidentally killing their father (a would-be writer who spent years tinkering with his Western romance, The Ravening Angel) and nearly killing Joy’s mother, Annie’s former reading tutor Rita (Sarah Gadon). In the first episode of Castle Rock, Annie adds another violent crime to her slate, shoving an ice cream scoop down local bully Ace Merrill’s throat after he threatens her little family. That’s an awful lot of bloodshed for one woman, but Annie still remains somewhat sympathetic—thanks in no small part to Caplan’s performance, which draws on intense levels of panic, despair, and the occasional jolt of euphoria. And though she often has an odd way of showing it, Annie’s fierce love for Joy does seem genuine. As we saw last season, and as we’ve known for decades thanks to Stephen King’s interconnected… Joy Ingalls (Elsie Fisher): Annie’s sheltered “daughter” just wants the chance to be a normal kid. She gets her first taste of that in Castle Rock, where she befriends a flirty neighbor, Chance (played by Abby Corrigan; the character’s full name, later revealed to be Georgia Lachance, is a hat-tip to The Body and Stand By Me). But Joy’s not always as naive as she appears. When Annie starts babbling about murdering Ace, Joy pulls a proto-Misery and ties her to the bed (episode three is appropriately titled “Ties That Bind”). She’s also curious enough to poke into her past, hesitantly reaching out to Rita after she’s removed from Annie’s overprotective care and placed in a group home. In this week’s episode, “The Mother,” Rita finds her way to Castle Rock and sees her daughter for the first time in 16 years, but it’s an uneasy reunion. Fisher is heartbreaking in this episode, when Joy must choose between the mother she’s always wanted and the mother she’s always known. (She chooses the latter, and the consequences are bloody as hell.) Pop Merrill (Tim Robbins): Castle Rock’s version of a mob boss is a pre-existing King character who gets a much more nuanced treatment here, with The Shawshank Redemption star Robbins providing the same kind of meta-context that Skarsgård and Sissy Spacek brought to season one. Pop’s dying of cancer, which hasn’t lessened his fondness for power, though it has made him more reflective when it comes to the big mistakes he’s made in life—like the fact that he gunned down Nadia and her brother Abdi’s mother when he was stationed in Somalia, and subsequently adopted them to alleviate some of his guilt. Ace Merrill (Paul Sparks): Pop’s nephew, adopted after his mother (Pop’s sister) died at the hands of his father, is a contemporary version of the character Kiefer Sutherland played in Stand By Me. He is a classic King bully, mean for the sake of being mean. He’s  racist despite having grown up with Nadia and Abdi, and is fully prepared to start a jealousy-fueled turf war with Abdi over their competing business interests. Until...Annie kills him...and he returns from the dead...a changed man. (Sharp-eared viewers will note he says he was in “Derry” during his absence.) He’s calmer, much better dressed, has an odd look in his eyes, and takes a strange interest in the long-abandoned Marsten House—the hulking mansion that’s central to the events of ’Salem’s Lot. All very bad signs. Nadia (Yusra Warsama): After emigrating from Somalia, Nadia and her brother were adopted by Pop without knowing why he chose them in particular. She got her degree at Harvard, and is now the head doctor at Castle Rock’s hospital, where she personally oversees Pop’s cancer treatment. That is, until she figures out the big secret that’s been eating away at him for years—and cuts all ties with Pop and then Abdi, who knew the truth but didn’t want to tell her. She’s no-nonsense, but has compassion enough to help Annie with her meds, and then to help Joy when she needs to escape her home life. She’s also secretly involved with her stepbrother, Chris (Matthew Alan), though their romance seems to be born more from convenience rather than passion. Abdi (Barkhad Abdi): Nadia’s business-minded brother picks an unfortunate (another way of saying that would be cursed) plot of land to construct a new mall and community center, though he’s seen so much real-life horror in his life he’s not terribly worried about local legends. His long-standing rivalry with Ace—sparked the moment Pop shows favoritism to his adopted son over his nephew—is on the brink of becoming an all-out war, at least until New Ace appears on the scene and a different dynamic begins to overtake Castle Rock. Since his return from the dead, New Ace has been lurking around, steadily adding to his supernatural posse. But they’re not exactly vampires, they’re more like...freshly resurrected pod people? His numbers include a police officer, the local preacher, a city councilwoman, a real estate agent, hospital employees, one of Abdi’s closest associates, and even Chris—his own brother. To an uninformed outsider, it looks a lot like some kind of freaky cult based out of the Marsten House. His renewed interest in Annie reeks of malevolence—especially after we see him murmuring (in French) over a coffin labeled “Amity Lambert, 1619,” promising his “prophet” that he’s found the ideal “vessel” for when she “rises.” Later, he shares a bit more about his plan with New Chris, explaining that they’ve waited 400 years for something big that’s happening in four days. Considering all the hints that Castle Rock has dropped about the town’s history involving witches and/or Satanists, depending on who you believe—and what we already know from season one, of course, about the region’s tendency to facilitate all kinds of unexplainable evil—that doesn’t bode well for anyone who hasn’t already been body-snatched. But “The Mother” ends by focusing on an entirely different Castle Rock conflict, as Rita marches Annie at gunpoint into the woods, ready to take revenge for her stolen life. It is a messy scene that sees a wild-eyed Joy appear out of the darkness armed with a syringe of Annie’s knock-out drugs, calling out “Mom!”—to which both women tearfully respond. But the needle goes into Rita, who drops the gun and shoots herself in approximately the same place that Annie stabbed her all those years ago. Somehow, the cops show up in the middle of the woods as Annie, who’s spent her entire adult life on the lam, turns and screams “I did it!” The tease for next week hints at another big flashback, this time going hundreds of years into the past to reveal exactly what makes Castle Rock such a uniquely rotten little town. Also to be seen: Will Annie go to jail for murder, or will she become a pod person first? And just what’s gonna happen at that 400th anniversary celebration?

By ANNA PALMER and JAKE SHERMAN 11/15/2019 05:54 AM EST Presented by Democrats plan to have Marie Yovanovitch detail the political retribution she experienced at the hands of Rudy Giuliani and his cadre of aides and advisers. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images WELCOME TO DAY TWO OF THE PUBLIC IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS … IN A FEW HOURS -- at 9 a.m. -- former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine MARIE YOVANOVITCH will appear in front of the House Intelligence Committee for the second open impeachment proceeding. HERE’S WHAT TO EXPECT … -- DEMOCRATS tell us that they will have her detail the political retribution she experienced at the hands of RUDY GIULIANI and his cadre of aides and advisers. In Democrats’ telling, YOVANOVITCH was totally screwed. She was a well-respected, 33-year veteran of the State Department, where she has served as an ambassador under George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump in far-flung locales like Kyrgyzstan, Armenia and Ukraine. She was an official who fought corruption wherever she went, Democrats will say. Until one day, she started hearing rumblings that GIULIANI was looking to get her canned. What did she hear from Ukrainians as she was being pushed out the door? And what did she hear from the administration -- for example, when she was told to get on a flight at 1 a.m. because she was in danger? This removal, Democrats will say, was the precursor to what they consider the improper behavior by President DONALD TRUMP. YOVANOVITCH was fired for doing her job, Dems say. -- REPUBLICANS are already saying that YOVANOVITCH is a sideshow. Yovanovitch, they say, was not in Kyiv for any of the time when TRUMP was alleged to have been trying to hold up military aid for an investigation into the Bidens. They’ll also say TRUMP is well within his rights to fire ambassadors whenever he pleases. CHALLENGES FOR BOTH … DEMOCRATS need to keep the line moving, as they say in baseball. New revelations, new details, new color. Networks are still planning to take this live -- and the cables all will, too -- so the lights are still bright. REPUBLICANS, to put it bluntly, can’t look like they’re whacking a career Foreign Service officer -- who happens to be female. Republicans have one woman on Intel. So they tell us they have to be exceedingly careful to not look as if they are ganging up on her. THE WHAT-TO-WATCH-FOR STORIES … Andrew Desiderio and Kyle Cheney … NYT’s Mike Shear AND THERE WILL BE MORE TOMORROW … “White House budget official is prepared to testify on frozen Ukraine aid,” by Kyle Cheney: “Mark Sandy, a senior White House budget official, is prepared to testify Saturday to House impeachment investigators about his knowledge of President Donald Trump's decision to halt nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, his lawyer indicated Thursday. “Sandy’s lawyer, Barbara Van Gelder — who is also representing former National Security Council aide Tim Morrison — said Sandy intends to testify if he receives a subpoena from lawmakers, a step Democrats have repeatedly taken with other cooperative witnesses to sidestep orders from the White House to refuse to testify.” POLITICO CNN’S MANU RAJU and JEREMY HERB: “Top Democrats privately concede major shift in public opinion on impeachment is unlikely”: “House Democrats are publicly holding out hope that historic impeachment hearings will persuade a vast majority of the American public that President Donald Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors — but privately many acknowledge that it's unlikely to happen. “In a private meeting this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her top lieutenants were skeptical about the prospects of a dramatic shift in opinion even as public impeachment hearings began this week, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The upshot, the sources said: Democrats need to move forward with impeachment proceedings even if the politics are murky, noting that even during Richard Nixon's presidency most of the public was divided until soon before he was forced to resign. “‘Well, I think there are hard views on both sides,’ House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN when asked if he thought the public's views would shift dramatically. ‘And sadly, apparently, Trump was perhaps right when he said of his own supporters that he could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and they would not require any accountability.’” CNN MEL ZANONA and JOHN BRESNAHAN: “Trump lays off Republican Ukraine critics” Happy Friday. ABOUT LAST NIGHT ... NYT'S JONATHAN MARTIN in Bossier City, La.: “But he also let slip his more personal interest in the Louisiana election, where Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking re-election, by recalling negative headlines he had received this month in another race. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky, a Republican, lost his re-election a day after Mr. Trump rallied supporters in the state. ‘You got to give me a big win, please, O.K.,’ the president pleaded with his supporters. ... “‘John Bel Edwards supports illegal aliens, not American citizens,’ the president said. He eventually broke character — ‘that was a long harangue,’ he observed of his own prepared remarks — and turned to other interests, such as trumpeting the Oxford University credentials of Senator John Neely Kennedy of Louisiana to a decidedly working-class audience.” WEST WING TAKE NOTE! … BLOOMBERG: “Trump Visit to Moscow for May 9 Would Be ‘Right Step’: Putin” A message from Facebook: The internet has changed a lot since 1996 - internet regulations should too It's been 25 years since comprehensive internet regulations passed.

Here’s how it happened: We’re told that Tapper emailed actor BRYAN CRANSTON to tell him that he liked “El Camino,” the “Breaking Bad” offshoot movie that’s now on Netflix. CRANSTON told Tapper that he was in D.C for the Brady Center’s dinner, which honored CLINTON for his efforts to curb gun violence. AFTER THE SCHOOL SHOOTING, TAPPER reached out to Clinton’s office, asking if he could come into the studio or call into the show to talk about the shooting … and voila. The former president got on the air, talking about everything from gun control to impeachment. A clip -- LAT: “Saugus High shooter opened fire on crowded quad in 16-second attack that left 2 dead and 3 wounded, sheriff says” -- FORMER REP. KATIE HILL sent an email to her former freshman colleagues about the shooting, which happened in her district and at her high school, asking them to “have our back in Congress.” The letter -- JOE BIDEN was in LA, and spoke about guns … SEEMA MEHTA: “Biden, a former longtime senator from Delaware, said he had previously taken on the gun lobby successfully, adding that his legislative accomplishments set him apart from the other 2020 candidates. ‘I’m the only one running who’s ever passed anything really big,’ he said.” LAT WHY BILL BARR WAS IN THE OVAL -- “Trump talks Russia probe audit with attorney general and White House counsel in Oval Office meeting,” by CNN’s Jim Acosta and Kaitlan Collins: “President Donald Trump met with Attorney General William Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone in an Oval Office meeting Thursday afternoon in which the so-called Horowitz report came up in conversation … The animated discussions were captured by TV crews outside the Oval Office on the South Lawn of the White House awaiting the president's departure for Louisiana. ... “The Horowitz report refers to a probe by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz on the opening of the Russia investigation. Horowitz’s office is expected to wrap up its investigation soon.” CNN DAILY RUDY -- “Giuliani Faces U.S. Probe on Campaign Finance, Lobbying Breaches,” by Bloomberg’s Chris Strohm and Jordan Fabian: “Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible campaign finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of an active investigation into his financial dealings, according to three U.S. officials. “The probe of Giuliani, which one official said could also include possible charges on violating laws against bribing foreign officials or conspiracy, presents a serious threat to Trump’s presidency from a man that former national security adviser John Bolton has called a ‘hand grenade.’ “A second official said Giuliani’s activities raise counterintelligence concerns as well, although there probably wouldn’t be a criminal charge related to that. The officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, provided the first indication of the potential charges under investigation.” Bloomberg Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

KICKING IT UP TO THE HIGH COURT … “Trump asks Supreme Court to shield his tax returns from prosecutors, setting up historic separation-of-powers showdown,” by WaPo’s Robert Barnes and Ann Marimow: “President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to stop a prosecutor’s investigation of his personal finances, a bold assertion of presidential power that seeks a landmark decision from the nation’s highest court. “The filing by the president’s private lawyers represents a historic moment that will test the court and highlights the Constitution’s separation-of-powers design. It also marks a new phase in the investigations that have dogged Trump throughout his presidency and have culminated in an impeachment inquiry.” WaPo MANAGING TRUMP … NYT: “Trump and the Military: A Dysfunctional Marriage, but They Stay Together,” by Helene Cooper, Julian Barnes, Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-Neff: “On another issue important to the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the Army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, have reached out quietly to Mr. Trump in recent days to ask that he not interfere in several war crimes cases. “Defense Department officials are concerned that presidential pardons could undermine discipline across the ranks. The Army, for instance, is prosecuting a Green Beret, Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, in the killing of a man linked to the Taliban in Afghanistan; Mr. Trump has indicated he may pardon him. ‘I do have full confidence in the military justice system,’ Mr. Esper told reporters.” 2020 WATCH … -- ON DEVAL … NYT’S ASTEAD HERNDON, JONATHAN MARTIN and MATT STEVENS: “Mr. Patrick and former President Barack Obama have been political allies for more than a decade and have remained friendly. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has told people he thinks highly of Mr. Patrick but that his entry into the race was coming ‘very late,’ according to two people who have spoken with the former president. Mr. Obama sees building a strong organization, especially in Iowa, as a kind of compulsory exercise for a serious candidate, these people said. “Discussing the race with Mr. Patrick, the former president covered the same talking points he had in his conversations with other candidates who have sought his counsel, according to a person with knowledge of their interaction: Campaign outside your political base, stay true to your beliefs and keep beating Mr. Trump in front of mind. “‘He didn’t ask for anybody’s blessing,’ said Valerie Jarrett, the former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, referring to Mr. Patrick. Ms. Jarrett, who is friends with Mr. Patrick and publicly urged him to run last year, praised him as an ‘outstanding leader’ but stopped short of offering an endorsement — taking care to note that he’s entering ‘an already strong Democratic field.’” NYT A MEMBER-STAFFER RELATIONSHIP? -- “Rep. Alcee Hastings faces ethics probe for longtime relationship with staffer,” by Sarah Ferris: “The House Ethics Committee announced Thursday it has opened an investigation into Rep. Alcee Hastings amid allegations that he is engaged in a relationship with an aide in his office. The Florida Democrat’s longtime relationship with his staffer, Patricia Williams, has come under more intense scrutiny just weeks after the resignation of Rep. Katie Hill (D-Calif.), who had been under investigation for a similar allegation. “The Ethics Committee did not specifically name Williams, though it clearly references their relationship, which has been documented in reporting by the Palm Beach Post and the Sun Sentinel. Hastings has previously dismissed concerns about dating Williams, who has been employed in his office since 2000, according to Legistorm. The two also purchased a $700,000 house together in 2017, the Palm Beach Post reported. “‘However it looks, it’s been looking like that for 25 years,’ Hastings told the Palm Beach Post this fall. His office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.” POLITICO -- THIS IS NEW … “DOJ investigating GOP Rep. Ross Spano over alleged campaign finance violations,” by John Bresnahan: “The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into Florida GOP Rep. Ross Spano over alleged campaign finance violations. Spano has denied any wrongdoing. The revelation came in an announcement by the House Ethics Committee, which has been asked by DOJ to defer its own probe into Spano while the criminal investigation unfolds. The Ethics Committee traditionally defers to law enforcement agencies while criminal cases are ongoing. “Spano, a 53-year-old former Florida state legislator who was first elected to Congress in Nov. 2018, has been under scrutiny for months over funds he loaned his campaign during last year's race. Spano claimed initially that nearly $175,000 he loaned his campaign came from personal funds. But it was later disclosed that Spano had received $180,000 in loans from personal friends.” POLITICO TRUMP’S FRIDAY -- The president will deliver remarks on transparency in health prices in the Roosevelt Room at 2 p.m. SUNDAY SO FAR … “Face the Nation”: Speaker Nancy Pelosi … Rep.

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images Katie Holt's decision to have a gunshot wound kit in her classroom wasn't just a sobering reminder of America's mass shooting reality. On Thursday, it likely saved a life. Holt, a choir teacher Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, used that kit to wrap the wounds of a student who ran into her room after she'd been shot. The student survived — but in this case, that single kit was barely enough, NBC News reports. Two students were killed and three more were hurt when a 16-year-old fellow student opened fire over a 16-second period as school began Thursday morning. Those injured included the freshman girl Holt treated, who was among 30 to 40 who rushed into Holt's room. ""The rookie teacher, who started in January, quickly wheeled a grand piano in front of the door and ushered dozens of her students into an office, locking the door behind them,"" The New York Times writes. But after confirming the girl had been shot twice, Holt left the office and got her gunshot wound kit — she ""only had one,"" she said. Holt wrapped the girl's wounds on her shoulder and torso while a ""really brave freshman"" helped apply pressure, she tells NBC News. And all around her, students were muffling their crying while one called the police and another ""grabbed a fire extinguisher — just in case the gunman made it inside,"" the Times continued. The alleged shooter was found after more than an hourlong search in the surrounding neighborhood and as schools in the district were locked down. The suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment of presumably self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the head and is still alive. Copyright © Dennis Publishing Limited 2021.

Jesse Osborne was 14 when he committed the two murders to which he entered guilty pleas last December. The teen shot his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, three times on September 28, 2016, killing him. He then strapped on an AirSoft vest, and drove three miles in his dad’s truck to Townville Elementary School, where he shot indiscriminately into the playground, killing student Jacob Hall. Investigators learned Osborne had researched mass shootings at schools online, reports WYFF. He was also interested in serial killers, according to police. Text messages recovered from Osborne’s phone indicate he had hoped to kill between 50 and 60 elementary school students in Townville in his planned attack, according to the station. But the gun jammed, thwarting his plan.

Three days after he arrived at the hospital, he was removed from life support and died. A superhero-themed funeral was held for him.

It was unclear if he has yet to enter a plea to the charge.

201,https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/11/but-laws-on-the-books-wouldnt-have-stopped-it/,"David Crane/Orange County Register via ZUMA After any mass shooting, the inevitable conservative reply is “Nothing Dems are proposing would have stopped this particular mass shooting anyway.” David Harsanyi goes all in on this tactic: California has already passed a “universal background check” law. California, in fact, already instituted a 10-day waiting period, a limit to handgun purchases, a microtracking system, a personal safety test, an “assault weapon” ban, an age hike on the purchase of shotguns and rifles from 18 to 21, “red flag” laws that allow police to confiscate guns without genuine due process, among many other restrictions. And none of those laws stopped the “slaughter” of children in Santa Clarita. Right. See, the thing is that these are all fairly feeble restrictions, and they aren’t likely to have much effect. The obvious answer is to pass laws that might actually make a difference, but unfortunately conservatives unanimously oppose them all. That means they never pass, which means the “slaughter” of children continues.¹ You might also want to note that whenever there’s a mass shooting, then by definition the laws currently on the books didn’t stop it. Ditto for murder, robbery, rape, carjacking, and so forth. You can play this juvenile game forever. Pay no attention to it. ¹Why the scare quotes? Beats me, though it’s become something of a trending fad on Fox News these days. Somebody should ask Harsanyi about that.

202,https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/bishops-meeting-reveals-division-over-how-influence-political-debate,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement Baltimore — After decades of a public face that has emphasized abortion, gay marriage and religious liberty, the body of the U.S. Catholic bishops is still debating how important other social and moral issues should be in their advocacy. The most intense discussion during the Nov. 11-13 meeting here of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops concerned whether opposition to abortion is the ""preeminent"" issue or not. That discussion involved a letter to accompany the rerelease of a 12-year-old document, ""Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship,"" which has not been significantly updated since the elections of both Pope Francis and President Donald Trump. The lack of a more timely statement on today's political reality is ""not reading the 'signs of the times,' as the Second Vatican Council instructed us to do. It's being stuck in time,"" said John Gehring, Catholic program director at the Washington D.C.-based Faith in Public Life, a progressive think tank and advocacy organization. Gehring sees the bishops' debate over the prioritization of abortion as emblematic of a deeper struggle about how much to embrace Francis' vision for the church, with a clear majority of U.S. bishops still slow to respond to what he calls ""the Francis moment."" ""We're six years into the Francis papacy, and the bishops, as a body, are still dragging their feet when it comes to institutionalizing the pope's priorities,"" Gehring said. Yet he noted a few ""cracks in the foundation"" with more Francis-friendly bishops gaining some leverage in the conference. But he warned that the bishops need to better navigate and message in a divided political system, ""if they don't want to be written off simply as an appendage of one political party."" Although much of the bishops' fall plenary meeting focused on internal church affairs, such as liturgical translations, priestly formation, and the need to attract and retain younger Catholics, it also included some discussion and reports on politically relevant issues, including immigration, racism and gun violence. The bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities gave a noticeably woman-centered presentation, calling for a yearlong program in which parishes and dioceses would offer support to pregnant women thinking about whether to carry their children to term. Called ""Walking with Moms in Need,"" the program would begin in March. The bishops also voted to begin developing a formal statement and comprehensive vision for Hispanic/Latino ministry in response to the synodal V Encuentro process. And they elected the first Latino as president of the conference, Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez. On the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court began hearing arguments to decide the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, one bishop at the meeting urged action to protect the program and to find a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But the bishops did not discuss or receive any report from the just-concluded Synod of Bishops for the Amazon, nor did climate change receive much attention. In fact, during a press conference, the outgoing bishops' conference president, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo of Galveston-Houston, called climate change ""important"" but not ""urgent."" Political fireworks Yet the fireworks, if there were any in an otherwise tepid meeting, involved the presentation from the bishops' working group on ""Faithful Citizenship."" Since the bishops had already decided last year not to issue a new document on political responsibility, this year's discussion and votes involved only supplementary materials: scripts for five videos and a letter to accompany the rerelease of the old document. The video scripts, which passed overwhelmingly, encourage political engagement and support for the common good, using lists of multiple issues to cover broad ground. One video starts with a young adult saying, ""As Catholics we witness to the life and innate human dignity of all people. Those not yet born, victims of war and racism, persons with disabilities, migrants and refugees, families affected by poverty, those on death row. The elderly and those nearing the end of their lives."" One script pointedly includes this statement: ""We are not aligned with any party, but we shine the light of our faith to influence parties to which we may belong."" Advertisement Advertisement But it is precisely a concern that the church appears aligned with the Republican Party that led to the debate over language about abortion in the letter for the ""Faithful Citizenship"" rerelease. After urging participation in public life and contributions to the common good, the letter's third paragraph paraphrases Francis' apostolic exhortation on the call to holiness, Gaudete et Exsultate: The call to holiness, he writes, requires a ""firm and passionate"" defense of the ""innocent unborn."" ""Equally sacred,"" he further states, are the ""lives of the poor, those already born, the destitute, the abandoned and the underprivileged, the vulnerable infirm and the elderly exposed to covert euthanasia, the victims of human trafficking, new forms of slavery, and every form of rejection."" That revised paragraph was the result of concerns raised by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich during the amendment and modification process. He had requested that the bishops quote more extensively from the papal document, including Francis' words about the danger of those who ""relativize"" social engagement, as if ""the only thing that counts is one particular ethical issue or cause that they themselves defend,"" mentioning specifically the ""defense of the innocent unborn."" In his written request for the longer quotation, Cupich cautioned about those who bring an ""ideological mindset"" to issues by either ""dismissing some issues by labeling them as part of an objectionable political camp or by taking a reductionist approach in defending only one issue."" ""From the beginning of his pontificate, Francis has made it clear that the unborn must be defended, but not to the exclusion of other issues of human dignity,"" Cupich wrote. Cupich also had called for changes to a section of the document that he believed gave ""singular attention to abortion and does so in language that is tendentious and remarkably different from the treatment of other issues in the lines that follow, as other issues are raised,"" he wrote. He noted that while the letter mentioned the environment, it did not contain even a full sentence on the climate crisis. On the matter of immigration, he urged ""more candor"" on the subject. ""We are not dealing simply with an 'absence of comprehensive immigration reform,' but rather a presence of demonizing rhetoric and abusive, violent policy directed at a group of human beings who are denounced as dangerous or worse by top elected officials,"" Cupich wrote. The committee made minor additions and responses to Cupich's concerns, including a sentence that mentioned ""gun violence, xenophobia, capital punishment and other issues that affect human life and dignity."" It rejected, however, his call for the entire paragraph of papal quotation, out of concerns to keep the letter short. Abortion language debate Before the vote on the letter Nov. 12, Cupich rose from the floor to again ask for the longer papal quotation, referring to comments from the papal nuncio's opening speech at the meeting in which he encouraged the U.S. bishops to ""reflect prayerfully"" on their communion with the bishop of Rome. Then San Diego Bishop Robert McElroy objected to a last-minute change in a section of the letter, which had deleted a reference to abortion as being ""as important as ever"" to now calling it ""our preeminent priority."" In requesting that change, Archbishop Alexander Sample of Portland, Oregon, wrote, ""We are at a unique moment with the upcoming election cycle to make a real challenge to Roe v. Wade, given the possible changes to the Supreme Court. We should not dilute our efforts to protect the unborn."" He was joined by three other bishops in suggesting the ""preeminent"" language: Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas; Archbishop Paul Coakley of Oklahoma City; and Bishop James Conley of Lincoln, Nebraska. Preeminent is defined as ""surpassing all others."" ""It is not Catholic teaching that abortion is the preeminent issue that we face as a world. In Catholic social teaching, it is not,"" McElroy said from the floor, adding that the longer quotation from Pope Francis makes that clear. ""Let's at least give the pope a fighting chance with his view,"" he said. But several bishops advanced quickly to the microphone to respond to McElroy. Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, who was one of the first U.S. bishops to support Archbishop Carlo Viganò's attack on Francis last year, said, ""I absolutely think 'preeminent' needs to stay."" Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput received applause for his comment, ""It has been very clearly the articulated opinion of the bishops' conference for many years that pro-life is still [the] preeminent issue."" In the end, the bishops voted 143-69, with four abstentions, to retain the word ""preeminent"" and to not add a lengthier quotation from Francis. The adoption of the letter passed, 207-24, with five abstentions. Bishop John Stowe of Lexington, Kentucky, told NCR that he agreed with McElroy and expressed concern that claims of abortion as exclusively important ""has been exploited for too many elections."" ""The whole point of the pope's teaching is we have to be consistent across the board,"" he said. ""Life issues are life issues."" At a later press conference, Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, New Jersey, said that if he understood correctly McElroy's intention of ""warning against exclusive choices of either/or"" or highlighting abortion ""to the point that other issues disappear,"" then ""he was right."" Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, warned against ""pitting one life issue against another,"" while acknowledging that individuals may be more committed to one issue or another. ""It's not a debate about whether one is more important than the other,"" he told NCR, ""but simply to say all of these issues bear our serious attention."" Seitz, who has a long history of involvement in the anti-abortion movement, said it was ""natural"" for him to turn to the task of supporting migrants and refugees at the border, ""who are facing the horror of being unwanted because of their origin"" and ""have no place to go, very few options in life,"" he said. Last month, he released a powerful pastoral letter on racism after a mass shooting in his diocese that targeted Latinos. At the meeting, he said, he witnessed a ""high level of support"" and a ""new level of interest and passion"" on issues of race and immigration from fellow bishops. ""Certainly, you'll find varying amounts of focus — and perhaps even understanding — but it's such a fundamentally Christian, Gospel issue that I think the bishops of the church get it,"" Seitz told NCR. Yet not all Catholics in the pews are similarly convinced, he said, adding that many are made fearful by anti-immigrant rhetoric in the culture. Stowe said he would like to see the bishops' support of immigrants, as well as environmental issues, more central to their discussion and better connected other life issues. Immigration is ""seen by too many Catholics as a fringe or special-interest issue, rather than essential to who we are,"" he said. The bishops also have to be ""prophetic"" about denouncing the racism that has become more visible during the Trump administration, he said. The bishops are ""irresponsible"" for not writing a new document on today's current political issues, Stowe said. ""After the Trump administration and with the pontificate of Pope Francis, just to bring out this old 'Faithful Citizenship' document that gets misquoted or selectively quoted election after election is not helpful."" Seattle Archbishop Paul Etienne told NCR that he thought the exchange about abortion ""took the air out of the room"" and proved a distraction. ""It was a good example of these polarizing views that are crippling us,"" he said. Etienne recalled Francis' message to U.S. bishops at a January retreat following last fall's meeting, in which he urged unity. ""He said, 'You guys need to get together,' "" Etienne said. ""And we're not yet."" [Heidi Schlumpf is NCR national correspondent. Her email address is hschlumpf@ncronline.org.

203,http://www.startribune.com/hamline-metro-state-professors-create-a-database-to-shed-light-on-mass-shooters/565002012/,"A shooter opens fire at a school or in an office, unleashing grief — and difficult questions. Soon after the hail of bullets comes a barrage of theories about what caused the killings and what could have been done to prevent them. Now a group of Minnesota researchers is introducing new data for the discourse with the creation of a “Mass Shooter Database” bolstered by $300,000 in federal funding. Hamline University Prof. Jillian Peterson, Metropolitan State University Prof. James Densley and a team of students researched and coded data for every mass shooter in the United States since Charles Whitman climbed a tower at the University of Texas in 1966 and killed 14 people, an event often considered the first modern-era televised mass shooting. Since then there have been 171 mass shooters, according to the federal government’s definition, killing 1,239 people. Peterson, who’s a psychologist, and Densley, a sociologist, are creating the database as part of the Violence Project, their nonpartisan think tank. They have used court records, witness accounts, interviews and media reports to collect more than 100 data points on each of the 171 mass shooters. The Violence Project database will be released next week to other researchers, policymakers and the public. But its work is already receiving international media attention. “The goal is to present the data to break down the myths,” Peterson said. The data points touch on the shooters’ history of mental illness, their criminal behavior, employment record, how they obtained their weapons and what they communicated before the incident — even the order they were born in their families. “Let’s draft policies and solution on data, vs. just emotions,” said Peterson, an assistant criminology professor and director of Hamline’s Center for Justice and Law. She said the project started out as a spreadsheet but really took off after Stephen Paddock opened fire on a Las Vegas country music festival in 2017, killing 58 people and wounding more than 400. “We just felt dissatisfied with the level of discourse and the level of knowledge about mass shootings,” Densley said. “People on the left would automatically say it’s a gun issue. People on the right would say this is a mental illness issue.” Included in their database are two Minnesota tragedies. In March 2005, 16-year-old Jeffrey Weise shot and killed nine people at a school and a home on the Red Lake Indian Reservation before taking his own life. In September 2012, Andrew Engeldinger, angered over losing his job, shot and killed five people at Accent Signage Systems in Minneapolis. The latter incident became the deadliest workplace shooting in Minnesota history. What the data show Densley compares their work to research started several years ago and led by the Washington Post to track the number of individuals killed by police in the United States, using news accounts and publicly available data. “We see our work as another example of that,” he said. “We are putting together the information that is out there, that is accessible and digestible. This moves us forward to say, ‘What do we actually know about mass shootings? What does the data tell us?’ ” The Violence Project is one of three research projects focused on mass shootings to receive funding from the National Institute of Justice, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. Federal authorities define a mass shooting event as four or more people killed in a public space, excluding gang and family violence. Peterson and Densley’s researchers wrote letters to 35 surviving mass shooters (most die at the scene) now in prisons across the country. Five agreed to sit for interviews, Peterson said. “We asked them, ‘Is there anything or anyone that could have stopped you?’ They all say yes. They recognized they were in crisis,” Peterson said. Densley, a professor in Metro State’s School of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, said they’ve just started to delve deep into their own data, looking for commonalities. He said they’ve made some early findings. For instance, nearly all the shooters shared four traits: early childhood trauma and/or exposure to violence at a young age; an identifiable grievance or crisis point; finding validation for their violent belief system, including study of past shootings; and the means to carry out an attack, including access to firearms. When a mass shooting occurs, many quickly assume it’s a mental health issue. “But we see crimes driven by interpersonal conflicts, problems in the workplace or a hateful ideology,” Densley said. “If we put all the eggs in the mental health basket, we will miss that part of the data.” While school shooters who target children tend to grab the most media attention, Peterson said the biggest increase in the past five years has been in restaurant and retail mass shootings. The data belie the “they just snapped” narrative that often comes out in the days after a mass shooting, as reporters interview neighbors and other acquaintances with limited insight into the shooter’s life, said Kyle Knapp, a student researcher and Hennepin County probation officer. “The perception is that shooters are the quiet guy in the office or school, but then they snapped,” Knapp said. But a number of them had prior criminal histories and many were in crisis, resulting in a marked change in behavior before the shootings. “We see these as opportunities for intervention,” Densley said. “What can we be doing in our workplaces, schools and communities to be providing resources and outreach to people in crisis?” Breaking down the data Densley said that the great majority of mass shooters get their guns legally. Most school shooters took them, unsecured, from parents or grandparents. “We still see examples where the existing legal system may have failed — individuals who have histories of domestic violence or criminal history that should have excluded them from getting firearms,” he said. Project researchers said they’re finding commonalities when they break down data into subgroups based on the shooters’ targets, including high schools, workplaces, houses of worship, colleges, retail stores and restaurants. Peterson said she’s spent time analyzing 13 high school shooters and has also looked at 57 school shooters with fewer than four victims. Of some 70 planned and executed school shootings, she found that none of the school shooters had figured out an escape route. “It’s all suicides. Most were actively suicidal before the shooting,” she said. Nearly 80% of the shooters leaked their deadly plans to others beforehand. More than 90% were current or former students, which should make schools and policymakers reevaluate the value of active shooter drills, Peterson said. “Lock down drills and active shooter drills — none of that makes sense if the perpetrator is running through those drills too,” she said. Zero-tolerance, punitive strategies where troubled teens are suspended or expelled, also may not make sense or mitigate the threat. A punitive approach may make friends and family members less likely to tell authorities or school officials about a possible threat. “We hope this data opens these windows of conversation again,” Densley said. “We could be preventing mass shootings, and that is our goal.”  Shannon Prather covers Ramsey County for the Star Tribune.

Hill surrendered her 25th Congressional District seat amid allegations she had a relationship with a member of her staff, and following the online publication of intimate photos of her with a female member of her campaign staff. She has denied any wrongdoing and said she was the victim of a revenge porn campaign. The district includes the Santa Clarita Valley and portions of the northern San Fernando Valley, Antelope Valley and eastern Ventura County. The special election now sets down a marker for the flurry of candidates who want to represent the 25th Congressional District, which represents an area that touches three major Southland valleys — from Santa Clarita to Simi to San Fernando valleys. When Hill resigned, state Assemblywoman Christy Smith, D-Santa Clarita, who represents a similar swath of area, immediately announced she would run, incorporating the same “playbook” that helped her win her Assembly seat in 2018. “We knocked on a lot of doors, made a lot of phone calls, we had investment from all over the country and California behind us,” she said in October. We’re just going to roll that program again to make sure we’re going to hold onto this seat.” Bthe GOP — which for years has dominated representation of the area — wants to flip that seat again. Several Republicans are vying for the district, including Hill’s predecessor Steve Knight, who lost the seat in 2018; Navy veteran Mike Garcia; bank executive Angela Jacobs Underwood; Mark Cripe, who works for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department; and George Papadopoulos, a former Donald Trump campaign aide.

Both students were barricaded in their English classroom during the shooting on Thursday, November 14. ""I remember the sound clearly,"" said student Zoe Rex. ""You know, I remember that, like the feeling of starting to panic and then having to calm down so I could help my friends calm down and keep myself steady. You know, it's just – it's terrible."" ""It made me feel like we're out in the open, like we're gonna die,"" Stapp told Newsy. ""Like, I really thought for a second that I could die. And that's something that, like, I shouldn't have to feel."" Saugus High School was prepared to respond with immediate mental health counseling. A school district spokesperson tells Newsy crisis counselors have been providing help since Thursday and will continue through the weekend. The National Center for PTSD estimates that 28 percent of people who have witnessed a mass shooting develop post-traumatic stress disorder and about a third develop acute stress disorder. The American Psychological Association says reactions to trauma can include development of new fears, sleep disturbance, nightmares, sadness, reduced concentration, or irritability. ""I woke up at 5:00 because something fell off of my bed and laid on the floor like that,"" Rex said. ""And I woke up like almost crying, almost screaming. It felt like something was like right here. You know, and I had to look around like, okay, I'm just in my room."" Churches around the area have opened their doors to anyone who wants to mourn and grief counselors have been meeting with families. Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital treated several of the victims and is supporting first responders. The LA County Sheriff says the shooting at Saugus High School took 16 seconds from start to finish. For those affected, the mental recovery will last far longer. ""It just it just scares me to ever want to come back,"" Stapp said. Newsy © 2021Newsy is an E.W.

CBS News points to figures from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) suggesting there have been 366 mass shootings during the first 319 days of 2019. Ironically, GVA has long reported higher numbers of mass shootings than other outlets because they define mass shootings differently. Whereas the FBI defines a mass shooting as four or more killed in one incident, not counting the attacker. The GVA considers an incident a “mass shooting” even if there are no deaths. The GVA definition is broadened to include “FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident],” not counting the attacker. Because of this, their count of incidents contains FBI-verified mass shootings, such as Virginia Beach (May 31, 2019), El Paso (August 3, 2019), Dayton, Ohio (August 4, 2019), Odessa / Midland (August 31, 2019), but also counts a November 11, 2019 shooting in Florida where there were no casualties. They count a November 10, 2019, shooting in Kansas City, a shooting that same day in Little Rock, Arkansas, and a November 9, 2019, shooting in Vidalia, Georgia, none of which had casualties. In fact, approximately 173 of GVA’s 366 “mass shootings” had zero fatalities, and this is to say nothing about the untold number of incidents with one casualty that they counted as a “mass shooting” as well.

Nathaniel Berhow died in a hospital one day after shooting himself in the head at the end of a 16th birthday rampage that left two fellow students dead. Berhow had been in critical condition since police officers storming the campus found him lying among the wounded.

210,https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/16/ccw-weekend-when-law-abiding-gun-activism-goes-wrong/,"JOSEPH PREZIOSO/AFP/Getty Images By Sam Hoober, Alien Gear Holsters One of the tropes that we like to repeat about ourselves as gun owners and concealed carriers is that we’re “law-abiding,” that we’re the most law-abiding folks around. Law-abiding, safe and responsible. Now, for the most part, it’s actually true. People who legally own and carry firearms tend to not be criminals, because that’s who we’re concerned with when we buy one anyway. In fact, John Lott found in a 2016 paper that concealed carry permit holders in Florida and Texas were convicted of felonies or misdemeanors at a rate of 22.3 convictions per 100,000 people, with a firearms violation rate of 2.4 per 100,000 people, which is one-sixth the rate of criminal convictions for police officers and one-seventh the rate of firearms violations of police officers in those states. Also, if you start committing crimes, you get your guns taken away and then you aren’t a gun owner (or a legal one!) any more. Granted, potential loss of gun rights is not really what keeps people from not committing criminal acts; most people don’t commit crimes because it’s wrong. But the thing is that a lot of us feel some aspects of or even all gun laws are wrong. Granted, this varies from person to person; some believe any gun regulation is inherently wrong or unconstitutional and others feel that some gun laws are probably warranted but current gun laws go too far or are in serious need of reform. That much is up to you. And sometimes, gun rights activists – the people that purport to speak on behalf of all of us who hold our Second Amendment rights dear – are not law-abiding. In fact, some lapse straight into criminality if not outright lunacy as part of their “contributions” to the cause. In Okalahoma, one Timothy A. Harper, 52, has been arrested for carrying an AR-15 rifle into a restaurant there, according to The Oklahoman. Harper has a history of conducting “Second Amendment Audits,” where he goes into restaurants and other businesses open carrying and often enough starting an argument when he’s asked to leave. Harper was open-carrying his rifle, which is legal in Oklahoma, to celebrate the new constitutional carry law, when he entered the Twin Peaks restaurant in Oklahoma City. However, he didn’t leave when asked, preferring instead to wait for police. When police arrived, Harper was reminded that Oklahoma law prevents carrying a loaded rifle in any establishment where alcohol is consumed on the premises, and now faces up to two years in prison if convicted. Where you can and can’t carry, under the law, is the sort of thing you need to know before you head out the door. In April of this year, gun rights and conservative activist Kanda Calef allegedly flashed a pistol in traffic in Colorado Springs, Colo. The motorist she showed the gun to – but did not directly point it at – happened to be an off-duty US Marshal of all things, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette. When a Colorado State Trooper located Calef in traffic, she had allegedly increased speed to 90 mph and was weaving through multiple lanes. She stopped when the bars were illuminated. Calef is facing felony brandishing charges, and her carry permit has been revoked. Adam Kokesh, a libertarian/anarchist activist, made national news when he loaded a shotgun while open carrying in downtown Washington, D.C. in 2013, according to a news report at the time in USA Today. Open carry of an unloaded long gun was not prohibited, but Kokesh wanted to make a statement and oh, boy did he. His apartment was raided by police, who also found psilocybin mushrooms, which he claimed were planted. Kokesh eventually pleaded guilty to two felony counts related to the arrest. Most of us likely remember the incident a few months ago in Springfield, Miss., where one Dmirty Andrechenko was arrested when he turned up to a Walmart wearing body armor and carrying an AR-15 to “test his Second Amendment rights.” Andrechenko was arrested and charged with making terrorist threats – a felony charge – for the incident, which – you might remember – occurred just days after a mass shooting at a Walmart in Texas claimed more than 20 lives. Andrechenko lucked out, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune; he was able to plead guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge. He has to undergo firearms training and will serve 48 hours in jail and be on probation for two years. Here we have a dilemma. On the one hand, gun ownership isn’t a privilege; it’s a right. Every American citizen, unless prohibited by virtue of felony conviction or other disqualifying criteria, has the right to carry and bear arms. And those rights are under assault by those who mean to curtail them in the misguided belief that it’s for the “greater good.” There is also a tradition of nonviolent resistance to oppressive laws in this country as there is elsewhere. But there is also something to be said for not giving the opposition any help. Click here to get your 1911 Pistol Shopping Guide.

213,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/16/sandy-hook-lawsuit-remington-books/,"Trending: A recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court has upended a longstanding legal roadblock that has given the gun industry far-reaching immunity from lawsuits in the aftermath of mass killings. The court this week allowed families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre to sue the maker of the AR-15 used in the attack. The case against Remington will now proceed in the Connecticut courts. Remington is widely expected to win the case, but critics of the gun industry are eyeing what they see as a significant outcome even in the face of defeat: getting the gunmaker to open its books about how it markets firearms. Lawyers for the plaintiffs are certain to request that Remington turn over volumes of documents as part of the discovery phase, providing a rare window into the inner-workings of how a major gun manufacturer markets its weapons. Those materials might include company emails, memos, business plans and corporate strategies, or anything that might suggest the company purposely marketed the firearm that may have compelled the shooter to use the weapon to carry out the slaughter. The plaintiffs also believe the ruling will put gun companies on notice about how they conduct business knowing they could wind up in the courts in similar fashion. “If the industry wakes up and understands their conduct behind closed doors is not protected, then the industry itself … will take steps to try to help the massive problem we have instead of do nothing and sit by and cash the checks,” said Joshua Koskoff, the Connecticut attorney who represents a survivor and relatives of nine victims who died at the Newtown, Connecticut, school on Dec. 14, 2012. The case hinges on Connecticut state consumer law that challenges how the firearm used by the Newtown shooter — a Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle — was marketed, with plaintiffs alleging Remington purposely used advertisements that targeted younger, at-risk males. In one of Remington’s ads, it features the rifle against a plain backdrop and the phrase: “Consider Your Man Card Reissued.” Remington did not respond to requests for comment after the U.S. Supreme Court denied its efforts to quash the lawsuit. Larry Keane, senior vice president and legal counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gunmakers, said he anticipates Remington will ultimately prevail and that it’s unfair to blame the gunmaker for Adam Lanza’s crime. “Adam Lanza alone is the responsible person. Not Remington,” he said. Suing the firearms industry has never been easy, and it was made even harder after Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. The law backed by the National Rifle Association gave broad immunity to the gun industry. The chances of the plaintiffs ultimately succeeding in this case are slim — a sentiment shared by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which said they face a “Herculean task” to prevail. Judges and juries generally have a tough time blaming anyone but the shooter for the crime, said Timothy D. Lytton, professor at Georgia State University’s College of Law and author of “Suing the Gun Industry: A Battle at the Crossroads of Gun Control and Mass Torts.” Add into the mix that Lanza himself didn’t own the firearm; he stole it from his mother after killing her in the home they shared, then went to the elementary school in Newtown, where he killed 20 children and six adults. “It makes it harder for juries to connect the dots. It’s a significant hurdle in all of these cases. It’s very rare that you have a very close timeframe between the marketing of a weapon and a mass shooting,” Lytton said. Lanza’s mother purchased the Bushmaster AR-platform rifle in 2010 from a Connecticut gun shop. It’s unclear if she or her son were influenced by or had seen Remington’s advertising. Still, it’s been a tough few years for the industry. Sales plummeted with the election of President Donald Trump, and gun-control advocates have outspent perhaps his most loyal supporter: the NRA. With slumping sales, some companies, including Remington, have faced bankruptcy. And in the wake of high-profile mass shootings, corporate America has begun pushing back against the industry. AR-platform long guns have been a particular bone of contention for gun-control advocates who believe the firearms — once banned for a decade in the U.S. — are especially attractive to mass shooters for their ease of use and their ability to carry large capacity magazines. While handguns remain used more often in mass shootings, ARs have been involved in some of the deadliest shootings, including when a gunman fired on a crowd of concertgoers outside his hotel room in Las Vegas in 2017, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds. The AR-15, its design based on the military M-16, has become one of the most popular firearms in the U.S. in recent decades. Lightweight, easy to customize and able to carry extended magazines, sales took off once the ban expired in 2004. There are now an estimated 16 million AR-platform long guns in the U.S. Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and a longtime watcher of gun politics, said a case against Remington could cause “pretty embarrassing information” to come out. “And it is certainly possible they will find memos or other documents that may significantly support their case that Remington was manifestly irresponsible in the way they marketed their guns,” Spitzer said. Even if embarrassing information isn’t uncovered, he said, it could have a long-lasting impact on the industry and, more specifically, Remington. Considered the oldest gunmaker in the United States, Remington — founded in New York in 1816 and now based in Madison, North Carolina — only emerged from bankruptcy in 2018. “They’re obviously in a precarious financial situation and this suit is certainly not helpful to them trying to restore their financial health,” Spitzer said.

215,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/17/james-corden-gun-control-school-shootings,"Late Late Show host dedicated portion of his program to California incident and called out politicians over inaction Last modified on Sun 17 Nov 2019 19.19 GMT Not content with singing karaoke with pop and movie stars, James Corden has bitten off a much gristlier and indigestible subject for his late-night US TV audience: gun control. After the most recent school shooting on Thursday at Saugus high school in Santa Clarita, California, which left two students dead and several injured, Corden took to the airwaves. While not known for political engagement – a range more typical of late-night rival Seth Meyers – the British host of CBS’ The Late Late Show with James Corden dedicated a portion of his usually fizzy talkshow to the incident.  “We were so saddened to hear of the shooting,” he said with feeling. “We’re horrified that another place of innocence, learning and education has become instead a site of violence and trauma. Our hearts break for the families, they really do.” He then took on the nation’s politicians for their consistent inaction over the issue, no matter how horrific or grotesque the numbers involved. “Whilst we continue to elect politicians without the moral courage to address gun laws, these tragedies are destined to keep repeating themselves,” he said. “Tonight, we grieve for the families of the victims and the community that’s been shattered. Tonight, we send our love to Santa Clarita.” But whereas Piers Morgan, the former CNN anchor whose outspoken gun control views made him a polarizing public figure in the US when he told viewers “something inside of me just exploded” after a series of deadly mass shootings. His stance, and the supercilious manner of its delivery, ultimately cost Morgan his job. With his appealing sense of inclusiveness, Corden runs no such risk. It’s not the first time Corden has spoken out on the subject. From the outset, Corden who now has 20.9 million YouTube subscribers in addition to his 1.35 million nightly TV audience, has told US late-night viewers he’s speaking out because he has children being educated in the US. “When I first came to America I never thought as a late night host I’d be talking about mass shootings, and so many of them,” he said after 17 students were murdered in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Florida in 2016. “I was told it was not my place and maybe they’re right. I still don’t understand the rules of American football. But I have children in America and I want my kids to be safe.” While he understood the need for earthquake drills, preparation drills for what to do if a gunman enters your school, “In my opinion, not an unavoidable phenomena of nature but sadly way more common than major earthquakes,” he said. Following the November 2018 mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, he broadcast a moment of silence as the images and names of the victims appeared on the screen. Since then Corden has spoken out after several school shootings as well as the massacres in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, in August. “It seems heartfelt with him, and it’s not as if he’s never spoken out about political issues,” said James Poniewozik, TV critic of the New York Times. “It doesn’t strike anyone as weird or alienating. He’s still generally a guy who lip-syncs with celebrities, so it just seems like another facet of things.” Other late-night hosts have come unstuck by getting too far out of their lane. Jimmy Fallon was criticised by some for getting political when he messed up Donald Trump’s hair, and also criticised by some when he said he would stay out of politics in the Trump era. Jimmy Kimmel also stepped out too far when took on the interminable subject of healthcare. But unlike hosts of old who used to be mild-mannered about politics today’s hosts have more freedom. The popularization began with John Stewart’s Daily Show, who begat John Oliver, Samantha Bee and Stephen Colbert. “It used to be that you’d stand out being too political on late-night, now it’s the opposite,” said Poniewozik. “Unless he went really hardcore in a particular direction, he has such a cuddly, inoffensive persona it’s hard to image him getting too much backlash.” But, Poniewozik cautioned, “that’s not to say he’s going to be any more influential than any other celebrity speaking out about gun control”.",2019-11-17 04:00:02,'We're horrified': James Corden tackles US gun control on late-night talkshow,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
216,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/17/ruling-opens-door-for-look-into-gun-mar/,"A recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court has upended a long-standing legal roadblock that has given the gun industry far-reaching immunity from lawsuits in the aftermath of mass killings. The court last week allowed families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre to sue the maker of the rifle used in the attack. The case against Remington will now proceed in the Connecticut courts. Legal experts widely expect Remington to win the case, but critics of the gun industry see the potential for a significant outcome: getting the gun-maker to open its books about how it markets firearms. Lawyers for the plaintiffs can request that Remington turn over documents as part of the discovery phase, providing a rare window into the inner workings of how a major gun manufacturer markets its weapons. Those materials might include company emails, memos, business plans and corporate strategies, or anything that might suggest the company marketed the firearm in a way that may have compelled the shooter. The plaintiffs also believe the ruling will put gun companies on notice about how they conduct business, knowing they could wind up in the courts in similar fashion. ""If the industry wakes up and understands their conduct behind closed doors is not protected, then the industry itself ... will take steps to try to help the massive problem we have instead of do nothing and sit by and cash the checks,"" said Joshua Koskoff, the Connecticut attorney who represents a survivor and the relatives of nine victims who died in the Newtown, Conn., school on Dec. 14, 2012. The case hinges on Connecticut state consumer law and challenges how the firearm used by the Newtown shooter -- a Bushmaster XM15-E2S rifle -- was marketed, with plaintiffs arguing that Remington purposely used advertisements that targeted younger, at-risk males. In one of Remington's ads, it features the rifle against a plain backdrop and the phrase: ""Consider Your Man Card Reissued."" Remington did not respond to requests for comment after the U.S. Supreme Court denied its efforts to quash the lawsuit. Larry Keane, senior vice president and legal counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents gun-makers, said he anticipates Remington will ultimately prevail and that it's unfair to blame the gun-maker for the crime committed by Adam Lanza. ""Adam Lanza alone is the responsible person. Not Remington,"" he said. Suing the firearms industry has never been easy, and it was made even harder after Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005. The law, which was backed by the National Rifle Association, gave broad immunity to the gun industry. The chances of the plaintiffs ultimately succeeding in this case are seen as slim -- a sentiment shared by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which said they face a ""Herculean task"" to prevail. Judges and juries generally have a tough time blaming anyone but the shooter for a crime, said Timothy Lytton, professor at Georgia State University's College of Law and author of Suing the Gun Industry: A Battle at the Crossroads of Gun Control and Mass Torts. Another factor is that Lanza didn't own the firearm; he stole it from his mother after killing her in the home they shared, then went to the elementary school in Newtown, where he killed 20 children and six adults. ""It makes it harder for juries to connect the dots. It's a significant hurdle in all of these cases. It's very rare that you have a very close time frame between the marketing of a weapon and a mass shooting,"" Lytton said. Lanza's mother purchased the rifle in 2010 from a Connecticut gun shop. It's unclear whether she or her son were influenced by or had seen Remington's advertising. It's been a tough few years for the gun industry. Sales plummeted with the election of President Donald Trump, and gun-control advocates have outspent the NRA. With slumping sales, some companies, including Remington, have faced bankruptcy.

Sen. Kamala Harris. | Nati Harnik/AP Photo By CARLA MARINUCCI 11/17/2019 04:58 PM EST Updated: 11/17/2019 09:24 PM EST Link Copied LONG BEACH, Calif. — Confronted by an army of reporters after speaking before 5,000 cheering Democrats in her home state, Sen. Kamala Harris delivered a defiant response to recent media reports that her flagging campaign is crippled by internal disputes and on the ropes. “I am very supportive of my campaign, of the people who are working on it,’’ she told reporters at the California Democratic convention after her appearance at a live Univision presidential forum here Saturday. “They've done great work which has gotten us to the point where we are today.“ “And let’s be clear,’’ she added. “We have to focus on the real issues in front of us. We’ve got an impeachment hearing going on, we’ve got a criminal living in the White House, we’ve got immigrants who are afraid of leaving their homes. We’ve got the 2020 census coming up. ... That’s where my head is focused.” The California senator’s pumped-up demeanor was bolstered by a powerful new endorsement from the iconic United Farmworkers Union. Still, much of the buzz this weekend among the activist delegates and guests gathered in Long Beach to hear from eight presidential candidates centered on her political future — and whether it may be time for her to withdraw from the race rather than face potential humiliation in her home state primary. After a spectacular campaign launch in January before 22,000 in her hometown of Oakland, Harris — once lauded as a top tier contender — has been mired in low single digits in the polls and dogged by reports of a campaign marked by flailing strategy, muddled messaging and a team in disarray. Harris’ loyal activist base, who call themselves the K-Hive, have lost none of the passion and intensity from those early days. They chanted her name this weekend, waved “Kamala Harris for the People” signs, and expressed anger and frustration at growing media reports of her political demise. And early endorsers like Gov. Gavin Newsom and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis insisted that Harris remains a contender whose fortunes are far from determined in a volatile race. But in the halls and meeting rooms of the Long Beach Convention Center, many of the battle-scarred Democratic insiders — strategists, elected officials, campaign operatives — had a far more caustic view of her chances, suggesting that Harris’ team has already let slip away her shot at the White House. With California polls strongly suggesting she might not win, place — or even show — in her home state, many privately expressed the view that Harris should begin seriously considering leaving the race to avoid total embarrassment in the state’s early March primary. Her continued weakness in the presidential contest could even have a more damaging effect, several said — encouraging a primary challenger in 2022, when Harris is up for reelection. “I don’t think she can last until California,’’ says Garry South, a veteran strategist who has advised Newsom and former presidential candidate Joe Lieberman. “I don’t wish her ill, but she’s got a decision to make: you limp in here and get killed in your home state, and it damages your reputation nationally. Or you pull out before the primary like Jerry Brown did in 1980 … and you at least avoid the spectacle of being decisively rejected.” Candidates have until late December to formally pull their names off the March 3 primary ballot in California. But some suggest Harris can withdraw from the presidential contest after Iowa if she fares poorly there — which would leave her on the California ballot, but enable her to justify the acute embarrassment of a distant finish in California by having left the race weeks beforehand. A battering in California “would bespeak of weakness..and could embolden some billionaire with visions,’’ said South, perhaps a monied business executive — or even a wealthy activist like Tom Steyer, whose own presidential candidacy is viewed as a longshot and who has toyed in the past with a run for US Senate. Interviews with a half-dozen veteran Democratic campaign insiders at the convention who spoke on condition of anonymity — many out of fear of angering a sitting senator — echoed South’s view. “It's not happening,’’ said one leading grassroots organizer working the campaign floor, speaking not for attribution. “She has her chance [to leave the race]...she should take it.” “Of course she should get out..but who’s gonna tell her?’’ agreed one leading Democratic strategist, who declined to speak on the record. Harris has told California insiders she is determined to stay in the race through Iowa, said the strategist, who added the real concern was reports of team members who are apparently beginning to snipe at each other and lay blame anonymously in various media outlets. Labor organizer Erin Lehane said Harris, who has been effective in recent days with her impassioned reaction in the wake of the Santa Clarita mass shooting, ""needs to ride it back to DC and say — I’m not leaving until comprehensive gun laws area a reality...she should be saying that now that this has happened in my home state, this is where I’m going to be.’’ Newsom waved off headlines about Harris’ collapse, and said he’s headed off on the campaign trail to assess the situation — and is determined to help her. “I’m going to Iowa, I’m going to check it out first-hand,’’ he said. “And I’ll say this: Polls don’t vote, people vote...and the only poll that matters is Election Day.” Reminded that those well-worn campaign tropes are embraced mostly by candidates facing defeat, Newsom gamely insisted that the field remains fluid — but he also acknowledged the uncertainty of Harris’ path. “Honestly... I don’t really have a sense of what it’s like on the ground and the momentum,’’ he said. “I live in a bubble with her, because she’s my friend...and we’ve been running around with all the volunteers and the [campaign] shirts, and we feel good,’’ he says. He recalled appearing at a recent fundraiser for Harris and said, “she was relaxed, i thought she did great, she felt good.’’ “She’s too talented to be dismissed — she’s too capable,'' he said. While pundits are hyper-focused on the race, voters are not ""as focused as we believe they are... so I see a lot of movement and potential.” As she stood in the convention hall on Friday, wearing a cape fastened with a “Kamala Harris for the People” button, parole officer Denise Alvarez, a Southern California military veteran, said she was undeterred by media reports and wanted Harris to fight until the very end. “I like that she wants to give everyone health care, but she respects our unions,’’ Alvarez said. “She has the best plan...she cares about people.” Alvarez dismissed the polls in key early states like Iowa, saying they’d been blown out of proportion. “The [campaign volunteers] say it’s going great.’’ Kounalakis, an impassioned Harris supporter, also blamed what she said has been negative coverage of Harris’ campaign. “I don’t think the press reports have been very fair,’’ she said. “She has an incredible leadership style. We love her. We support her...presidential politics are tough, but she’s tough enough to handle it.” She added, hopefully: “At the least, she’s going to be our state senator for California for a long time.” “Her problem is now there are probably a lot of people out there who thought she would be a rocket — like me.” David Doak, a veteran Democratic pollster David Doak, a veteran Democratic pollster who has directed presidential campaigns for Richard Gephardt and Joe Biden, says that despite her talent, Harris has been diminished by missteps and failed to effectively deliver a rationale for her run. “Presidential politics are a combination of how much people like you and like what you’re saying — measured against viability,’’ Doak says. “And her problem is now there are probably a lot of people out there who thought she would be a rocket — like me.” “But as you get these stories about your campaign not doing well, and you don’t show up in the polls, the people who don’t have a pick tend to line up with other people,’’ he says. “It’s a chicken and egg thing...if you don’t have viability you don’t get votes.’’ Doak, who advised Sen. Alan Cranston's unsuccessful 1984 presidential run, doesn’t believe Harris is entirely out of the picture — now or in the future. “Is she a longshot now? Yeah,’’ says Doak. “I don’t think staying through Iowa will hurt her. And frankly, she will be forced to get out if she doesn’t do well in Iowa and New Hampshire.” But as far as her future in the Senate, he said, “that stuff is forgotten pretty quickly.""

The Sunday night shooting rampage shook the close-knit neighborhood, home to mostly Latino and Southeast Asian families, and prompted police to form a task force to look at the activities of Asian gangs in the central valley hub about 160 miles (260 km) southeast of San Francisco. “Two of my officers were actually covered in blood and had to be decontaminated, go shower and change their uniforms based on what they landed in and were trying to fix,” Fresno Police Chief Andy Hall told reporters. “They are hurting a bit in that neighborhood right now and officers are hurting too,” Hall said. “We’re going to do everything we can to get this matter resolved on all levels.” None of the people at the party had any known affiliations with gangs, Hall said, describing the gathering as a “very peaceful, very quiet” family event of about 30 people before the two gunmen showed up. The gunmen made their way into the yard through an unlocked gate and began firing with semi-automatic pistols shortly before 8 p.m. local time. “What I can tell you is, this was not a random act. It appears this incident was a targeted act of violence against this residence,” Hall said. He said most of the guests were Hmong. The slain victims were all men aged between 25 and 35. The Fresno Bee newspaper reported that Hmong make up nearly five percent of the city’s population and that two of the victims, including one of the deceased, were well-known singers in that community. Several children were at the home but were indoors when the shooting began and were not hurt. None of the people at the home were armed and all had been cooperative with detectives, Hall said. He said they were not able to identify the attackers because it was dark and only described flashes of light as the weapons fired. Some of the party-goers may have been involved in a disturbance in the Fresno area the previous week, Hall said, and investigators were trying to determine if the two incidents were related. “We’ve got a single focus within the organization and this is not going to be tolerated in the Southeast Asian community or in any community,” he said. The 2010 census showed there were 91,224 Hmong living in California. The United States recruited the Hmong to fight communism in the late 1960s, when the Vietnam War spread into Laos. Many of them fled to the United States after a Communist government came to power in Laos in the early 1970s.

The movement has since expanded to include other demands, including direct elections for the city’s leaders. More than 3,000 protesters have been arrested since the protests began five months ago.

Also: Updates on a mass shooting in Fresno. By Jill Cowan Good morning. (If you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox, here’s the sign-up.) Over the weekend, Democratic presidential candidates swung through Southern California, making their pitches to state party officials in Long Beach and to young voters at California State University Los Angeles. And as has often been the case in a race marked by an extremely crowded field — and one that has managed to become even more so in recent days — it was telling who showed up and who didn’t. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Los Angeles Trade Technical College on Thursday, where he slammed Republicans for yielding to the N.R.A. hours after a shooter opened fire at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, but he didn’t attend the party’s convention in Long Beach and didn’t participate in a Univision forum there. When Mr. Biden skipped another state Democratic Party convention this year, Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at Cal State L.A., said it was most likely because Mr. Biden was focusing his efforts on high-dollar donors and big-ticket endorsements, rather than on the most progressive wing of California’s vast Democratic contingent. As CalMatters reported, though, that means Senator Elizabeth Warren’s absence this time was “a bigger puzzler” since she’s been warmly received at past conventions and recently bulked up her staff in California. In any case, my colleagues Jennifer Medina and Lisa Lerer reported that top candidates — including Senator Bernie Sanders, who was in Long Beach, and Ms. Warren, who spoke to reporters in Iowa — found themselves grappling with President Barack Obama’s warning the day before that “the average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system.” [Read the full story on candidates’ responses to President Barack Obama’s advice.] Mr. Sanders chuckled briefly and responded, “Well, it depends on what you mean by tear down the system.” Julián Castro, the former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who was also in Long Beach, said he took his former boss’s words “very very seriously.” But he emphasized that he believed any of the Democratic candidates would be well-positioned in the general election. “I don’t think that anybody in this campaign has articulated a vision for the future of the country that would not command a majority of voters in November of 2020,” he said. “Their vision for the future of the country is much better and will be more popular than Donald Trump’s.” Mr. Sonenshein, who helped organize the forum at Cal State L.A. on Sunday, said he hoped the five candidates who participated took away a sense that California is worth courting — even if it at times feels too big and diverse to directly address. “It felt like a more place-based discussion,” he told me. [Read more about the role of the California State University system here.] Although issues that affect Latinos were the forum’s nominal focus, in practice, that translated into a wide-ranging discussion of issues that affect all Angelenos. (As Jennifer noted on Twitter, Los Angeles’s Latino population is larger than Iowa’s entire population.) Among them: health care and housing affordability, a crisis that is affecting regions across the country, but perhaps most acutely in Los Angeles and in the Bay Area. Mr. Sonenshein suggested that similar conversations in communities around California could help root their campaigns in a state with a newly significant primary. “It’s not impossible to grasp California,” he said.

227,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/IhCmD4fgRaw/,"Four people are dead and six more have been injured in a mass shooting at a backyard party in Fresno, California, police said Sunday evening. No suspects have been identified, and police said multiple shooters were still on the loose. “This was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Lt. Bill Dooley of the Fresno Police Department told reporters at the scene on Sunday. “Everyone was watching a football game this evening, when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.” It is the third mass shooting in California in less than a week. It follows a school shooting in Santa Clarita that left two students dead, and a domestic violence incident in San Diego, in which a father shot his wife and four children before turning the gun on himself. Here’s what we know so far. The shooting occurred shortly before 8 p.m. local time at a family home in east Fresno, where some 35 people had gathered for a family party and to watch football. Police said at least two gunmen snuck into the backyard and opened fire on people before fleeing the scene. There were around 16 male adults in the backyard watching football. “Witnesses described only seeing flashes of light from the weapon,”  Fresno police chief Andrew Hall said at a Monday press conference. “It was too dark on that side of the house to see the suspects.” After the shooting, the suspects fled on foot, according to Chief Hall. Authorities said that Fresno police received multiple 911 calls and when they arrived on scene they found “several individuals deceased in the backyard.” Police later confirmed that four victims, all men, had died. Three died on the scene. The fourth died from his injuries at a local hospital. Another six, also all men, were transferred to a local hospital after being treated on scene by a triage unit. All the victims were shot outside the house, police said. Police said that, as of Monday, they had no leads on the identities of the shooter. Police said that the scene was now stable, and that they were going from door to door seeking witnesses and surveillance camera evidence. “This was a mass casualty shooting, there’s no doubt about it,” Dooley said. At Monday’s press conference, Chief Hall said that the victims were all males and were ages 23, 31, 38 and 40. All except for one were Fresno residents. The names of the victims were not released by the police. According to Chief Hall, the shooters appeared to be deliberate in their attack. “This was not a random act,” Chief Hall said. “It appears that this incident was a targeted act of violence against this residence.” The chief also said they are investigating leads and that they have information that some people at the party were involved in a “disturbance” earlier this week. Hall speculated that the incident is tied to “Asian gang-related violence,” and said that an Asian gang task force has been formed to find the shooters and preventing any retaliation. He made it clear, however, that there was no indication that anyone at the residence has gang ties. Fresno is located in central California, about 220 miles north of Los Angeles, and is a diverse area that’s home to more than 70 ethnic groups. The home targeted in the shooting is believed to be owned by members of Fresno’s Hmong community. Calvin Gatison, who lives on the block where the shooting happened, told the Associated Press that the street is usually very peaceful but that there have been two shootings in the area in the past couple of weeks. “For something like this to happen in a quiet neighborhood, it scares you,” Gatison said, according to the AP. “This is the third shooting I’ve heard since the middle of September.” Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com and Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.",2019-11-18 09:14:08,4 People Were Killed and 10 Injured at a Backyard Party in California.

229,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/11/18/kamala-harris-ca-weve-got-criminal-living-white-house/,"Do tell, Senator Harris. What exactly are these crimes of which you speak that President Trump has committed? Kamala Harris joined many of the other 2020 Democrat hopefuls in California over the weekend for the California Democrat Party’s Fall Endorsing Convention. Her declaration that “we’ve got a criminal living in the White House” was part of a hyperbolic speech delivered to convention attendees. Yesterday I wrote about House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s remarks at the convention. He labeled President Trump as a “charlatan”, so Harris’s use of the word “criminal” falls along the same lines. The people who are the first to complain about incivility in politics are not hesitant to add their own part to the ugliness. Harris is getting a bit desperate and the tension is showing. Asked by the press about her failing campaign, she denied her inevitable exit from the race. “I am very supportive of my campaign, of the people who are working on it,’’ she told reporters at the California Democratic convention after her appearance at a live Univision presidential forum here Saturday. “They’ve done great work which has gotten us to the point where we are today.“ “And let’s be clear,’’ she added. “We have to focus on the real issues in front of us. We’ve got an impeachment hearing going on, we’ve got a criminal living in the White House, we’ve got immigrants who are afraid of leaving their homes. We’ve got the 2020 census coming up. … That’s where my head is focused.” Kamala hasn’t been able to get above 3% in any of the recent polls and there are now reports of internal strife in her campaign. There’s talk that a new campaign manager may be in order. And now Harris may be facing another problem: A second report Friday described internal strife at Harris’ Baltimore campaign headquarters, with several aides calling for campaign manager Juan Rodriguez’s resignation following his late October decision to lay off field staffers in several states and dedicate Harris’ already dwindling campaign war chest to a seven-figure TV ad campaign before the February Iowa caucus. Rodriguez said in an Oct. 30 campaign memo obtained by Fox News that several dozen people would be laid off at the campaign’s Baltimore headquarters — as would volunteers in New Hampshire, Nevada, and California — in an effort to go “all-in” in Iowa. He also said the campaign aimed to dedicate $1 million to a media campaign in the weeks before the Feb. 3 caucus, a figure now considered unlikely given Harris’ lackluster funding. Three additional staff members were laid off and another quit in recent days at Harris’ campaign headquarters in Baltimore, unnamed aides told Politico on Friday. They said several aides have approached campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, to force Rodriguez to step down, claiming his failed leadership is responsible for the campaign’s recent troubles. Calls for a new campaign manager might make sense if there was hope that the campaign is viable. This campaign isn’t viable. She was once the darling of the press and Democrats hoping that a black Democrat woman could succeed where Hillary didn’t – become the first woman president. Reporters fawned over her and female reporters even did stories about going shopping with Kamala. Yes, it was that nonsensical but then reality bit and Kamala never really rose to the occasion. It turns out, she’s just not likable. That sounds petty but the truth is, voters have to like a candidate to vote for her or him. She’s busy rocking out to her favorite playlists and dancing in second-line parades but no one buys the schtick. And that laugh of hers alone is enough to turn off voters. Kamala isn’t even doing very well in her home state – a state she represents as a U.S. Senator. Currently, Elizabeth Warren leads in California polling. The campaign is wrought with a lack of focus and “No discipline. No plan. No strategy,” according to one official. So far no one wants to risk her ire and tell her it’s time to shut the campaign down. One Democrat strategist suggests Kamala center her campaign around gun violence and take advantage of a recent mass shooting in the state. Hmm. Where have we heard that campaign strategy before? How did it work out for Robert Francis O’Rourke’s flailing campaign when he tried that strategy? Labor organizer Erin Lehane said Harris, who has been effective in recent days with her impassioned reaction in the wake of the Santa Clarita mass shooting, “needs to ride it back to DC and say — I’m not leaving until comprehensive gun laws area a reality…she should be saying that now that this has happened in my home state, this is where I’m going to be.’’ The only real good news coming out of the California Democrat convention for Harris was the endorsement announced by the United Farm Workers (UFW). The campaign hopes this will jump-start her campaign. Harris received the endorsement of the United Farm Workers (UFW), a California-based group that was established by liberal icons Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, among others, and has longstanding ties to progressive politics. The union represents more than 10,000 agricultural workers across the West Coast. Since Sept, farmworker leaders have held candidate info meetings. UFW member leaders voted for their choice after our Nov 9th interviews of all candidates who accepted our invitation. The UFW board affirmed the member leaders’ strong majority vote to endorse Sen. Harris. — United Farm Workers (@UFWupdates) November 17, 2019  She stood with us on heat protections. She marched with us for overtime protections. We support @KamalaHarris because of her leadership on immigrant justice and her fight for our equal treatment as farm workers. #WeFeedYouhttps://t.co/SqStGBhF1s — United Farm Workers (@UFWupdates) November 16, 2019  Democrat candidates treasure labor union endorsements. In 2020, the hope is that working-class Americans will flip back to voting for the Democrat nominee instead of President Trump, for whom many union members voted in 2016. With the success of the economy and stock market under this administration, though, it is hard to see that happening in any great numbers. Someone is going to have to gather up some courage and tell Kamala Harris that this is not her time. Her past record as Attorney General in California and as District Attorney in San Francisco turns off the social justice crowd and her other ideas about health insurance – abolishing private insurance – will never fly with working people who get insurance through their employers. Union members don’t want her messing with their health insurance, either. Other issues like education reforms and open borders are the same as most of the other candidates. She doesn’t distinguish herself. She wants to hang in there until after Iowa and New Hampshire to see how she fares in the two first states. We’ll see if she makes it that long.

230,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/disarming-the-nra-how-guns-flipped-virginia-blue/,"Rob Dobi On May 31, a disgruntled city employee entered a municipal building in Virginia Beach and opened fire, killing 12 people. Virginians were horrified, then outraged. Ever since the mass shooting that killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, there’d been a growing push to strengthen the state’s comparatively loose gun laws. But Virginia Beach was a tipping point: Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam convened a special legislative session in July with the sole purpose of passing gun control laws. Yet Virginia is also home to the National Rifle Association. On the day legislators gathered in Richmond, NRA officials turned the Republican House speaker’s conference room into a de facto war room, distributing hundreds of hats and T-shirts to the gun rights supporters who showed up at the Capitol. Some were packing heat; several donned full tactical gear and toted assault rifles as they milled about under the summer sun. The display was an attempt to “intimidate and silence” the hundreds of gun control activists rallying nearby, said Shannon Watts, founder of the gun control group Moms Demand Action. Inside, the Republican-controlled legislature adjourned after just 90 minutes without considering a single bill. “That was the curtain raiser for this election,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, the organization—heavily funded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg—that Moms Demand Action is part of. Shannon Watts speaks on Capitol Hill in 2014. Mark Wilson/Getty Nearly four months later, Virginia’s Republican majority in the Senate and House was swept out in an off-year election. Now, for the first time in more than 25 years, Democrats have full control of the state government. Several pieces of progressive legislation that Republicans had blocked—workplace and housing protections for LGBTQ residents, a minimum wage hike, the Equal Rights Amendment—could soon pass. But for gun control activists, this blue wave signifies something bigger: Republicans’ allegiance to the gun lobby is eroding their appeal with suburban voters they can’t afford to lose. After the Virginia Beach shooting, gun groups went all in on Virginia. Everytown and Moms Demand Action say they spent at least $2.5 million to elect Democrats. Giffords, the group co-founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, spent $300,000 on ads. Meanwhile, the NRA—currently hobbled by political scandals and depleted finances—barely contributed $350,000 to GOP candidates. And it didn’t take defeat well. The day after the election, the NRA tweeted a photo of Bloomberg with Harvey Weinstein and a message to Watts: “Your freedom-hating group has one thing only: Bloomberg’s billions…This election was not because of you or your organization. It was because of ONE billionaire’s wallet.” Many people were watching this election as a bellwether for 2020. “What you saw in Virginia was really a trend that had been visible in 2017 and 2018,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. “President Trump is really unpopular in the suburbs, and that motivates a lot of Democrats to turn out.” But beyond Trump’s unpopularity, the shift on guns has helped flip the state’s once solidly red suburbs. Polls found that gun violence was the number one issue for Virginia voters, who showed bipartisan support for passing universal background checks and removing guns from people deemed to present a safety risk. “It used to be that Democrats wouldn’t talk about gun control outside of the most blue urban districts,” Farnsworth said, but no longer. Case in point: the 40th District—right next door to NRA headquarters—whose longtime state Rep. Tim Hugo was the last Republican lawmaker in the Northern Virginia suburbs. Everytown and Giffords identified the district as flippable and supported Dan Helmer, an Army veteran who made gun reform the center of his campaign. Helmer told me that even before Virginia Beach, the issue of gun control was “overwhelmingly” the top concern among voters he talked with. “More Virginians die of gun violence each year than die in car accidents, which, if you think of the number of firearms and then the number of cars, is mad,” he said. He won by over six points. Dan Helmer Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post/Getty Looking ahead to November, gun control groups are optimistic that they can repeat their success nationally. Peter Ambler, Giffords’ executive director, thinks the outcome in Virginia proves that the once–deep red swaths of suburbia are turning blue. Gun safety has become a potent opportunity for Democrats in those areas, and gun control activists’ relentless campaigning is paying off. “I’m not going to tell you Democrats will end up with control of Texas in the next year and a half,” Ambler said, “but what you will see in states like Texas…is the same type of shift that you’ve seen in Virginia for the past few years.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Police responding to a call shortly before 10 a.m. local time found a man and a woman dead in the front seat of a car in the parking lot and another man deceased outside the car, Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said. “It appears several rounds were fired into the car, and a handgun was found on scene,” Ford said. Authorities have not revealed a motive for the shooting. Ford said it appears a gunman shot the male and female victims and then turned the gun on himself. Ford said all three knew each other but declined to describe their relationships or identify them pending notification of immediate family. He did say one of the victims was a current or former employee of Walmart. Duncan resident Aaron Helton, an Army veteran, said he was at the Walmart around 9:45 a.m. when he heard nine shots and saw the gunman, weapon in hand. According to Helton, another man walked up, put a pistol to the gunman’s head and told him to stop shooting. Helton said he saw the shooter was turning the gun on himself and looked away. Ford acknowledged a person not connected with the shooting approached the gunman with his weapon drawn but could not confirm Helton's version of the events. “I don’t know if it was a crime of passion,” Helton said. Tera Mathis, spokeswoman for the Duncan Police Department, said names, ages and other personal details regarding the victims were not available. She declined to comment on reports that the shooting was an act of domestic violence. At an afternoon news conference, Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said there was never an active shooter inside the store, and he described the shooting as an isolated incident. Schools in the city were briefly placed on lockdown. A large portion of the shopping center parking lot – surrounding a bullet-riddled vehicle – was cordoned off for most of the day. Walmart spokesman Payton McCormick told USA TODAY that no staff members were involved in the shooting or injured, and the store was not evacuated. State Rep.

(Larry Valenzuela/The Fresno Bee via AP)  FRESNO  — Police in the central California city of Fresno were searching Monday for suspects and trying to determine a motive for the killing of four people at a backyard party and the wounding of six as dozens were watching football on TV. Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley said “unknown suspects” sneaked into the backyard at about 6 p.m. Sunday and fired into the crowd. Fresno Deputy Police Chief Michael Reid told the Fresno Bee newspaper and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations that 10 people were shot and that three were found dead in the backyard. A fourth person died at the hospital. Six others are expected to survive and were recovering at a hospital. The victims were men ranging in age from 25 to 35, Reid said. “What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Dooley said. “Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.” Fresno Police spokesman Lt. Mark Hudson did not immediately return email and phone messages Monday seeking additional comment. The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are now in stable condition, the TV stations reported. About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began, Reid said. “Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said. No one had been taken into custody and authorities said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the shooter or shooters. Police were going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects. Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in San Francisco responded to the shooting, the Bee reported. Other shootings have happened recently in the same neighborhood, leaving neighbors frightened, they said. Choua Vang told the Bee that his neighbor’s house was shot at last week and that he feels unsafe outside after dark. “We’re thinking about moving out of the neighborhood,” he said. “We don’t know how many more shootings there will be.” It was at least the second fatal gun attack Sunday in southeastern Fresno, the Bee reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death early Sunday at a home in another part of the city. Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected. Sunday’s Fresno shootings came after two other mass shootings in California. Last Thursday, a 16-year-old student at a Southern California high school in the city of Santa Clarita outside Los Angeles shot and killed two classmates and wounded three other teens before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day. And on Saturday, police in San Diego said a husband shot and killed his wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son wounded in the shooting was on life support on Sunday, family members said.

234,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/2020-democrats-california-nevada.html,"Advertisement Supported by The 2020 Democrats headed West to campaign in two key states. “I don’t think it matters what happens in New Hampshire or Iowa, which are not representative of the country,” Harry Reid said. By Jennifer Medina LAS VEGAS — Want to understand Iowa’s outsize role in selecting the Democratic presidential nominee? Just come to the West, where anyone in Nevada or California will tell you: We are the voters presidential candidates should be paying more attention to. Nevada will be the third state to vote in 2020, with its caucus coming just 11 days after the New Hampshire primary. And voters in California, which sends 495 delegates to the national convention, will start casting early ballots in the Democratic primary soon after the Iowa caucuses begin. As more than a dozen candidates made their way through the states this weekend for campaign rallies and marathon candidate forums, there were near constant reminders about why each could make more sense to lead the charge to pick the party’s nominee for president. There are more Latinos in Los Angeles County than the total population of the state of Iowa, as a moderator pointed out at the start of a forum on Latino issues in Los Angeles Sunday morning. Nevada, already a majority-minority state, is also home to one of the fastest growing Asian-American communities in the country. “I don’t think it matters what happens in New Hampshire or Iowa, which are not representative of the country,” said former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, speaking to reporters before the state Democratic Party’s “First in the West” event Sunday night, which featured speeches from 14 candidates. “The press focuses on those two states, and I think they do that to the detriment of our country.” Mr. Reid, the former majority leader, has long been a champion of boosting Nevada’s influence in the primary season by pushing it further ahead in the calendar. Still, it remains a state where politicians occasionally need to be reminded about how to pronounce its name — Ne-VA-da, never Ne-VAH-da. And the concern about potentially being looked over is so great that “we matter” is now both a hashtag and rallying cry to signal that Nevada voters deserve the same kind of attention lavished on those in other early states. “Nevada is eclectic, in a way that Iowa is just not,” said Nazia Junejo, a physician in Las Vegas who immigrated from India 30 years ago. “We live in a city where people come from all over the world. We used to feel comfortable, but now we’re just not. Now people are scared and we understand that.” Though the candidates’ basic stump speeches remain largely unchanged whether they’re in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, or Long Beach, Calif., the questions they face can be entirely different. For every question about farm subsidies or ethanol in Iowa, here they comb over the granular details of housing policies and immigration enforcement. In a series of forums in California and Nevada this weekend, candidates offered a glimpse of how they were pitching themselves to an electorate that is less white, more likely to be represented by a labor union, and often more liberal than crowds in New Hampshire and Iowa. With his signature call for a political revolution, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont received a rowdy welcome in both California and Nevada. “The truth is that this country faces an unprecedented moment in our history with enormous challenges before us,” Mr. Sanders said in Las Vegas on Sunday. “And tinkering around the edges just won’t do what has to be done. In this unprecedented moment in American history, we need an unprecedented response.” Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and the latest candidate to enter the race, received a lukewarm reception through much of the weekend, in his first major events since starting his campaign. California Democrats greeted his five-minute speech with a collective shrug, and those in Nevada had mostly left the room before he began his remarks, the last of 14 candidates who spoke Sunday night. The field of Democratic presidential candidates has been historically large, but all have dropped out except Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee to challenge President Trump. But the leading candidates were more enthusiastically welcomed. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had the most raucous section of the ballroom in Las Vegas, entering to a thundering marching band and letters spelling out “NV 4 JOE” decorated with twinkle lights. (While Iowa may be known for its steak fries, the biggest night in Nevada politics had no food but plenty of glitz and poker chips.) “The risk of nominating someone who wouldn’t beat Trump is a nation and a world our children and our grandkids won’t want to live in,” Mr. Biden told the crowd, leaning on one of the central arguments of his campaign. “I can beat Trump. I can beat him.” Campaign aides were not abuzz over the latest poll in Nevada, which showed Mr. Biden ahead of Senators Elizabeth Warren and Mr. Sanders. Instead, they were focused on the latest numbers from Iowa, where Pete Buttigieg has begun to take a commanding lead. Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., faces significant skepticism in Nevada and especially California, where he is far less known outside of donors backing his bid. To the crowd in Las Vegas, Mr. Buttigieg touted his health care plan as better for unions, who have fought for paid heath care during contract negotiations for years. “If you are a culinary worker who negotiated a plan you like, you should have the option to keep it,” he told them. At the California Democratic Convention in Long Beach on Saturday, candidates were pressed for detailed specifics on immigration policy. Asked about the possibility of sending American troops to Mexico to fight against drug and gang violence, Mr. Buttigieg said he would be open to considering it. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who arrived at the forum late after her staff said she was stuck in traffic, declared herself a “Sangeleno,” a portmanteau of her former home in San Francisco and her current status as an Angeleno. “The last time I looked, one in two Californians was born outside the United States or has a parent who was born outside the United States, myself included,” Ms. Harris told the crowd on Saturday. At the Latino Issues forum the next morning, Ms. Harris said she believed Immigration and Customs Enforcement needed to be radically restructured, calling it the most dysfunctional federal agency. Julián Castro, the former housing secretary who is calling for Iowa to lose its long-held distinction as the first-in-the-nation nominating state, said issues such as immigration and transportation would be more of a consistent focus in the campaign if states like Nevada, with significant urban populations, voted sooner. Though Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota typically casts herself as a Midwesterner who wins Midwestern votes, she carefully tailored her speech to the Nevada crowd, praising Mr. Reid and mentioning victims of the 2017 mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren spent much of their weekend in Nevada, holding campaign rallies. But both sat out the California events, as he held a fund-raiser in Portland, Ore., while she campaigned in Iowa. Rusty Hicks, the chairman of the state party, derided the choice as “misguided” and a public snub of California and Latino voters. Their decision showed “blatant disregard and disrespect to California’s grass-roots leaders who make the phone calls, knock the doors and give the money in swing districts and swing states alike year after year after year,” he wrote on Facebook. Asked about her decision to skip California, Ms. Warren said that she was not ignoring any group of voters, pointing to the time she spends speaking with them on her selfie line as one bit of evidence. When she stepped onstage in Nevada Sunday night, Ms. Warren reiterated her call for “big, structural change” on issues like health care, taxes and government corruption. “We’re not going to change it by a nibble here and a little bit of change over there,” she said.

235,https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/brownsville-block-party-shooting-suspect-pleads-not-guilty-to-murder/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Metro By Andrew Denney Submit November 18, 2019 | 2:59pm A 20-year-old reputed gang member pleaded not guilty on Monday to killing a 38-year-old man during a July shooting at the Old Timer’s Block Party in Brownsville that also left 11 people injured. Kyle Williams made a brief appearance in Brooklyn Supreme Court to enter the plea while a group of deceased victim Jason Pagan’s relatives, who wore matching black shirts emblazoned with the words “Justice for Jason,” looked on. Williams has been charged with second-degree murder, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Prosecutors say the mass shooting began as the Old Timer’s Block Party, which has been violence-free throughout its 56-year run, was winding down on July 27 at the Brownsville Playground, at Hegeman Avenue and Sackman Street. Police say Williams and Pagan were rival Bloods members and that Williams allegedly fired shots at Pagan’s head and torso. One of Pagan’s associates then allegedly returned fire, police say, sparking a gunfight — with innocent bystanders in the crossfire. G.N. Miller G.N. Miller Paul Martinka View Slideshow “A beloved community celebration held peacefully and joyously became chaotic and tragic when this defendant allegedly opened fire in the middle of a crowd,” Brooklyn District Attorney Erc Gonzalez said in a statement. “Senseless gun violence that puts innocent people in harm’s way has destroyed too many lives and will not be tolerated in Brooklyn.” Williams has allegedly confessed to killing Pagan while being videotaped. Following the hearing, Edward Friedman, a defense attorney appointed to represent Williams, said he had not yet reviewed the videotaped confession. “I wouldn’t call it a confession yet,” Friedman said.

236,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/18/california-mass-shootings-gun-violence-control,"Shootings at high school, home and backyard party prompt renewed calls for action against gun violence First published on Mon 18 Nov 2019 20.34 GMT Ten people were killed in three mass shootings in California in just four days, marking a particularly brutal wave of gun violence incidents in the state. On Thursday morning, a 16-year-old student from Saugus high school in Santa Clarita, 30 miles north of Los Angeles, shot five classmates and then himself. Two of the victims, a 14-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, succumbed to their injuries, as did the gunman.  On Saturday morning, a gunman in San Diego killed his estranged wife and three of their children, boys ages three, five and 11. A fourth son, age nine, was on life support over the weekend, and the gunman also died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The following night, four people were shot dead in Fresno, 200 miles north of LA, after a shooter entered a backyard party and fired into the crowd. The victims in the Sunday evening attack were men between the ages of 25 and 35, according to police, who said six others were injured and expected to survive. Including the gunmen, 12 people died, and at least 10 others were injured in the three tragedies, with countless additional students, families and communities terrorized and traumatized by the attacks. “The failure to protect our communities, families, and children is a waking nightmare that needs to end,” the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords said in a statement Monday. “If we don’t act, generations of Americans will expect gun violence to be a public safety threat that could change their lives no matter where they live.” Giffords, a gun safety advocate and shooting survivor, released her statement following reports of yet another mass shooting at a Walmart, with police in Duncan, Oklahoma, saying three had been killed outside the store on Monday. “We should refuse to live in a world where our children live in constant fear of gunfire. We should never accept this level of gun violence as normal,” she said. The victims in the Saugus high school attack were Gracie Anne Muehlberger, a 15-year-old cheerleader, and Dominic Blackwell, a 14-year-old football player. The gunman, who used a .45-caliber pistol, carried out the shooting in just 16 seconds, according to authorities. Investigators have not released any information on the shooter’s motive. In the San Diego murder-suicide, police said the mother was in the middle of a divorce with the shooter and that she had sought a restraining order a day before the tragedy. In Fresno the following day, roughly 35 people were gathered in a backyard watching a football game when someone opened fire. The suspect or suspects fled the scene, and investigators are working to determine the reason behind the killings. The attacks highlighted the frequency of mass casualty incidents in the US, where major gun violence attacks are so common that these kinds of attacks often barely register as national news stories. “There’s a moment where you just feel hopeless,” said Kasey Zahner, the San Diego group lead for Moms Demand Action, a gun safety organization. “It’s like, I’ve been working on this for how many years, and these incidents are still happening? I try to focus on all the good people who are working so hard so this doesn’t happen to another family.” Zahner, who lives 15 minutes away from the site of the Saturday shooting and has two young children, said it was difficult to process: “It’s unimaginable … We are heartbroken.” Everytown for Gun Safety, a not-for-profit organization for gun policy reform, said there had been more than 25 mass shootings this year and more than 220 since January 2009. The group defines mass shootings as cases in which four or more people are shot and killed, excluding the shooter. The group’s analysis of 173 mass shootings in recent years found that 59% of them happen in private homes. Ari Freilich, state policy director with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, noted that California had some of the strongest gun laws in the country and that research had shown Californians are significantly safer from gun violence than the rest of the country. “Those protective laws tragically weren’t enough here,” he said, adding: “The news cycle will move on, and other communities unfortunately will be impacted by this, but for the families who are left with empty seats at their dinner tables for all of time … it is a brutal personal loss. It’s for them we do this work.” This article was amended on 18 November 2019.

238,https://people.com/politics/donald-trump-hosted-joker-white-house-screening/,"According to Yahoo News, the president ""liked the film"" Donald Trump treated himself Saturday night to the fictional story of a man so misunderstood and abused by the world that he goes insane in revenge. The president hosted a White House screening of the Joaquin Phoenix-starring Joker, PEOPLE confirms. According to  Yahoo News, which first reported details of the showing along  with CNN, Trump, 73, “liked the film.” The president — who is the subject of an ongoing impeachment investigation in the House of Representatives after he lobbied Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, though he insists he did nothing wrong — reportedly watched the movie with family, friends and some staff members in the White House screening room. As  IndieWire notes, Trump (though notedly ambivalent about reading), is something of a movie fan: According to IndieWire, he has said his favorite film is  Citizen Kane, Orson Welles’ opus about the rise and fall of a media tycoon, while he’s also raved about 1988’s  Bloodsport and the 1966 western  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Trump has strong negative opinions, too. Earlier this year, he vented on Twitter about Hollywood’s portrayal of violence in response to The Hunt, a thriller about a group of people being killed for sport. The movie was pulled from theaters after two high-profile mass shootings. “They create their own violence, and then try to blame others,” Trump tweeted in August, days after a 21-year-old posted an anti-immigration screed online and then killed 22 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, according to authorities. RELATED: Joker Review — Joaquin Phoenix Isn’t Clowning Around as the Terrifying Batman Villain Joker, which traces the origin of the famous Batman villain, has also stirred controversy since hitting theaters in early October: While its box office broke records and Phoenix drew raves for his lead performance, the film’s violence and extreme misanthropy led many critics to revisit discussions on how movies might influence their audience. (President Trump has faced some of that same criticism himself, given his inflammatory rhetoric and the occasional outbursts of violence at his events.) RELATED: Joaquin Phoenix Sprints Through the Streets of New York City as He Films Joker Joker is widely seen as an Oscar contender, which would keep it in the pop culture conversation through February. Some theaters banned fans from wearing costumes to screenings, while the Century Aurora and XD theater in Aurora, Colorado, where a 2012 mass shooting took place during a midnight premiere for The Dark Knight, refused to show the film.

Gervais attended the country music festival with two of her friends, Dana Smith and Pati Mestas — who was one of the 58 people killed when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock sprayed bullets into the crowd of 22,000 people from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort and casino on October 1, 2017. Gervais’ death Friday brings the total number of lives lost from the shooting to 59. Dena Sarvela of Vancouver, Washington, Gervais’ sister, told KVVU-TV that her heart stopped on Friday from stress put on her body from her injuries. Before that fateful day two years ago, Gervais spent her free time riding ATVs and going to concerts with her girlfriends, the New York Times reported in 2017. But after being struck in the back in the shooting, the grandmother was forced to spend her next two years in a wheelchair without the use of her legs and with extremely limited use of her arms. “She hurt. Even though she was paralyzed from the neck up, she could feel all the pain,” Sarvela told KVVU-TV. “There was scrap metal still in her because he used exploding bullets.” RELATED: Scenes of Horror & Heroism: 2 Years Later, How Survivors and Victims’ Loved Ones Described Vegas Massacre Sarvela added that the long and difficult process of her hospitalization and eventual arrival back home to her home in California caused her sister to lose her “zest for life.” “It took almost a year before she was able to transport out to go back home to California, that was rough,” she told the outlet. “She lost her zest for life because of it, because of the shooting, because of her injuries that she sustained. It was hard to be that same person, that we all know and love.” Before getting shot, Gervais was ready to retire, Sarvela said. “Her and I spoke the night before she went to the concert,” she said. “She was going to sell the business, she was ready to just go abroad and enjoy life, like she should have, and it was snatched from her. She worked her life, and butt off for – just to go enjoy, you know, and she doesn’t get that, she doesn’t get that chance.” RELATED: Remembering the 58 Slain Victims of the Las Vegas Concert Massacre, 2 Years Later Sarvela added that her sister is now with her husband, whom she lost in the early 2000s: “I also know she was missing her husband very, very much, and that’s what gives me hope – that she’s with him right now. Gives me a lot of hope, and I know they are.” “She was my sister, my caregiver, you know, even though I do have a mother, she basically raised us, and she was amazing, and I thank her very much to this day for helping me be who I am. And I hope she’s proud, because she’s a big part of that.” “She’ll never leave my heart, ever.” KVVU-TV reported that there will be memorial services held for Gervais at her home in California as well as her childhood hometown of Kansas City. Sarvela and her brother are also planning to take their sister’s ashes on a road trip across the U.S., the outlet said.

(Larry Valenzuela/The Fresno Bee via AP)  By TERENCE CHEA and OLGA R. RODRIGUEZ | The Associated Press FRESNO  — A close-knit Hmong community was in shock after gunmen burst into a California backyard gathering and shot 10 men, killing four. “We are right now just trying to figure out what to do, what are the next steps. How do we heal, how do we know what’s going on,” said Bobby Bliatout, a community leader. Sunday evening’s attack killed Xy Lee, a Hmong singer and musician whose videos on YouTube have been viewed millions of times. Also killed were Phia Vang, 31; Kou Xiong, 38; and Kalaxang Thao, 40, all of Fresno, according to the coroner’s office. Three others remained hospitalized in serious condition, Community Regional Medical Center said in a statement. No motive or suspects were identified by police. “Our community is in mourning, and we still don’t know what’s going on, or who are the suspects,” said Pao Yang, CEO of the Fresno Center, a Hmong community group. The Hmong are an ethnic group from Southeast Asia. Many fled after fighting alongside the United States during the Vietnam War. There are about 300,000 Hmong living in the U.S., according to the 2017 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. California has the nation’s largest Hmong population and about 25,000 live in Fresno, comprising about 5% of the city’s population of 525,000.  The gunmen targeted a house where about 16 men had gathered outside to watch football on television, police said. At least two men armed with semi-automatic handguns walked through a side gate and without a word began firing randomly into the crowd before fleeing in the darkness, Police Chief Andrew Hall said. The shooters did not speak, and no one reported getting a good look at them. Witnesses saw only flashes when the pistols were fired, Hall said. Police were investigating whether the shooting was connected to a recent “disturbance” involving some of the people at the party, Hall said. He did not describe the incident other than to say it occurred within the last week. Women and children inside the house weren’t hit, Hall said. The chief said at least 60 officers were investigating along with the FBI, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “We’re coming for you,” the chief said of the attackers. While police hadn’t found any gang connections to the victims, Hall also announced the establishment of an Asian gang task force because of concerns about the possibility of retaliation or more violence ahead of the Hmong New Year, which is celebrated the week after Christmas and draws thousands to Fresno. There have been 11 violent incidents related to Asian gangs in the city this year, three of them in November, police said. An Asian-American man was shot to death at a home earlier Sunday but police had not linked that killing to the party attack, Hall said. The mass shooting in a quiet, working-class neighborhood erupted in the midst of a low-key family event, Hall said. “This is truly a good group of people who were simply having a party,” the chief said. “It’s very devastating, very,” said Paula Yang, a friend of the homeowner, whose brother, Kou Xiong, died in the attack. “We don’t know what to say to people, but we hope that the legal system will find justice.” She said the shooting has many in the community fearful. “Even right now, families are gathering inside saying, what can we do to protect our home from this day forward?” It was the third mass shooting in four days in California. Last Thursday, a 16-year-old boy armed with a handgun killed two students and wounded three others at his high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita before killing himself.

On Saturday, a San Diego man in the midst of a divorce shot and killed his wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son was on life-support. There have been eight mass killings in California so far this year, claiming the lives of 33 people, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. That’s a dramatic increase from previous years, with eight mass killings in the state for all of 2016-2018. The increase mirrors the national trend in 2019. There have been 39 mass killings this year in the United States, compared with 25 in 2018, according to the database, which tracks homicides where four or more people are killed, not including the offender. ___ Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

By JAKE SHERMAN and ANNA PALMER 11/18/2019 06:00 AM EST Presented by The American Action Network is launching a series of ads targeting Democrats like Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) over impeachment, calling it a “politically motivated charade.” | Mary Altaffer/AP Photo FIRST IN PLAYBOOK … THE BIG HOUSE GOP ANTI-IMPEACHMENT CAMPAIGN … THE AMERICAN ACTION NETWORK, part of a cluster of center-right groups that promote House Republicans and their policies, is launching a $7 million advertising blitz in 37 districts, criticizing Democrats for impeachment, terming it a “politically motivated charade” and arguing that elections should be decided by voters. THE AD CAMPAIGN -- the most expansive, coordinated ad campaign on impeachment to date -- criticizes Democrats for promising to be “different,” but instead impeaching the president instead of working on other legislative items, such as securing the border and fixing health care. The spot is current -- it stars Rep. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-N.Y.), who is shown on CNN saying that the impeachment process is “preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.” That comment ran last week on CNN. The 30-second spot, as shown here featuring Rep. Joe Cunningham of South Carolina … The list of districts WHAT THIS MEANS: There’s much focus on polls that show the overall support for impeachment sitting in the high 40s. But Republicans are focused on the handful of Dem-held districts that President DONALD TRUMP won in 2016. They believe those districts are ripe for the picking, and impeachment is a political loser there. This campaign is an attempt to position Democrats as maniacally focused on removing the president -- and nothing else. -- THE BIG BUYS: $500,000 against Rep. Max Rose of New York, who got his own specialized ad that you can see here … and $500,000 against Reps. Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Susie Lee of Nevada. Michigan Reps. Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens will have $400,000 against them. The district-by-district spend -- EACH DISTRICT will have at least 800 points, a measure of the size and frequency of an ad campaign compared to the audience, on air. Reps. Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.), Kendra Horn (Okla.), Jared Golden (Maine), Xochitl Torres Small (N.M.) and Cunningham all have 1,200 points. FLIP-FLOP ALERT … NYT’S ANNIE KARNI, MAGGIE HABERMAN and SHEILA KAPLAN: “Trump Retreats From Flavor Ban for E-Cigarettes”: “It was a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers. Seated in the Oval Office in September, President Trump said he was moving to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes as vaping among young people continued to rise. “‘We can’t have our kids be so affected,’ Mr. Trump said. The first lady, Melania Trump, who rarely involves herself publicly with policy announcements in the White House, was there, too. ‘She’s got a son,’ Mr. Trump noted, referring to their teenager, Barron. ‘She feels very strongly about it.’ “But two months later, under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters, Mr. Trump has resisted moving forward with any action on vaping, while saying he still wants to study the issue. Even a watered-down ban on flavored e-cigarettes that exempted menthol, which was widely expected, appears to have been set aside, for now.” NYT -- WAPO’S JOSH DAWSEY and LAURIE MCGINLEY: “[O]n Nov. 4, the night before a planned morning news conference, the president balked. Briefed on a flight to a Lexington, Ky., campaign rally, he refused to sign the one-page ‘decision memo,’ saying he didn’t want to move forward with a ban he had once backed, primarily at his wife’s and daughter’s urging, because he feared it would lead to job losses, said a Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations.” WaPo NEW EMAILS … MICK MULVANEY, CALL YOUR OFFICE … WSJ’S REBECCA BALLHAUS: “Sondland Kept Trump Administration Officials Apprised of Ukraine Push”: “The emails reviewed by the Journal show that … Mr. Sondland urged Mr. Morrison to schedule the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky before Ukrainian parliamentary elections on July 21. ‘Sole purpose is for Zelensky to give Potus assurances of “new sheriff” in town. Corruption ending, unbundling moving forward and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. Mr. Morrison replied that he was ‘tracking.’ “On July 19, a day before the president was initially scheduled to speak to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Sondland emailed a group of administration officials including Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Perry to say that Mr. Zelensky was prepared to assure the president that he would open investigations. “‘I talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive Potus’ call,’ Mr. Sondland wrote. ‘Will assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will “turn over every stone.”’” WSJ Good Monday morning of what will be an epic week for the impeachment inquiry, with eight witnesses due to testify in open hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, including the most anticipated -- Gordon Sondland -- on Wednesday.

Biden Jr. and little else, moderate Democrats appear suddenly determined to fight for control of their party in the 2020 elections. “The shift in attitude has come in fits and starts over the last few weeks, seemingly more as an organic turn in the political season than as a product of coordinated action by party leaders. But each assertive act has seemed to build on the one before, starting with a debate-stage clash last month over ‘Medicare for all’ and culminating in recent days with the entry of two new moderate candidates into the primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick, and a gentle warning from former President Barack Obama that Democrats should not overestimate voters’ appetite for drastic change. … “For months the Democratic race was defined in terms of which candidate could promise the most daring policy reforms — a contest in which Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was struggling to keep pace with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As the most liberal candidates set the agenda, many in the party establishment squirmed, anxious about alienating moderate voters. “Now the primary has become an increasingly jumbled contest, shaped by Democrats’ competing appetites for visionary ideas, tactical realism and sheer political novelty. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears to be harnessing those tensions to his advantage, at least in Iowa, where for the first time he emerged as a clear front-runner in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll this weekend.” NYT -- HOLLY OTTERBEIN and DAVID SIDERS in Long Beach, Calif.: “‘Scared to death’: The left sees an establishment plot to take down Warren, Sanders” -- MAGGIE SEVERNS: “Meet the people who woo big donors for Elizabeth Warren” -- BOSTON GLOBE: “Trump promised Wisconsin’s farmers his trade wars would pay off. They’re still waiting,” by Jess Bidgood in Bloomer, Wis.: “Trump’s promise to restore US trade dominance won him deep support in farm country, which helped him secure his narrow victory in Wisconsin in 2016. As the trade skirmishes Trump has triggered have hurt farmers directly, the president’s message has been simple: Trust me, it will all pay off. “They are still waiting. But the wave of new and steeper tariffs has yet to fray many farmers’ faith in a president who promised to even the playing field.” Boston Globe DISPATCH FROM MILWAUKEE … ANNA was in Milwaukee last week and caught up with several of the key figures involved in putting on the upcoming Democratic National Convention. While the 30-degree, snowy weather was a far cry from what it will be in July, the Democrats’ operation is up and running focused on logistics, housing and media. THREE THINGS TO WATCH: -- HOUSING: Limited hotel inventory was one of the biggest concerns when Milwaukee got the convention bid. The issue is still top of mind for folks looking at making the trip out to Wisconsin, but convention organizers say they have tried to assuage worried delegations about having to stay far away from the convention hall. Part of their strategy: telling state parties in August (six months before they would typically get their hotel information) where they will be based to allow more time for planning. They also made sure each state party is staying at one hotel (even if it is in Rosemont near O’Hare airport) and have created seven delegate geographic “clusters” to allow for better-organized security and transportation. What we don’t know: Where will the big-donor Dems be staying? How many rooms will the nominee be allotted and where? Where will the media be staying? -- MONEY: Raising cash is always difficult for political conventions, but the Dems may have a harder time than usual in pulling together the $70 million needed by July. Some challenges: Companies are wary of investing in a convention that could have a candidate like Elizabeth Warren as the nominee, and Milwaukee doesn’t have a huge number of corporate headquarters. There was also a shakeup earlier this month on the fundraising front when host committee fundraising director Marcus Switzer was replaced by Leah Israel. Still, sources close to the fundraising effort say they expect to raise $20 million by January. The big question will be if they can secure commitments and checks beyond the typical institutional donors who pony up for the event every four years as the convention gets closer. -- MEDIA: The DNC is looking to shake things up when it comes to media presence at the convention and try to take advantage of emerging technology and the growing prominence of podcasts. One thing under consideration includes allowing space for newer outlets like The Skimm and others to have a set-up inside the conventional hall to capture more behind-the-scenes content. -- MISC.: Don’t expect any big changes with credentialing. Organizers still plan on having hard passes for attendees to get into the convention hall, and those will change daily, as in past years. Scooters: This will be the first convention where the motorized, two-wheeled vehicles will help convention-goers get around. But scooters will not be allowed in the perimeter. The arena has fewer skyboxes, so look for the DNC to capitalize on other entertainment spaces. OBAMA THE DEPORTER -- “The Trump administration’s immigration jails are packed, but deportations are lower than in Obama era,” by WaPo’s Abigail Hauslohner: “Though President Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his first term, his administration lags far behind President Barack Obama’s pace of deportations. Obama — who immigrant advocates at one point called the ‘deporter in chief’ — removed 409,849 people in 2012 alone. Trump, who has vowed to deport ‘millions’ of immigrants, has yet to surpass 260,000 deportations in a single year.” WaPo TRUMP’S MONDAY -- THE PRESIDENT will meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at 4:15 p.m., but he has nothing else on his public schedule aside from the usual intelligence briefing.

Gervais, who was shot in the back and suffered spinal injuries in the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting, died Friday, Nov. 15, after being brought to Redlands Community Hospital, the coroner division of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department reported in a news release. Gervais was declared dead at 4:51 p.m., the coroner reported. The Associated Press also reported that Gervais has died, citing KPTV in Oregon, which quoted Gervais’ sister, Dena Sarvela of Vancouver, Washington. The San Bernardino County coroner’s news release stated that the division planned an autopsy. Before Gervais was taken to the hospital, the coroner’s office said she was being cared for at a nursing facility in Redlands. Gervais went to the outdoor country music concert with two friends. One of them, Menifee resident Pati Mestas, was killed during the mass shooting. The three friends were among more than 20,000 concertgoers from throughout the country who attended. Gervais was one of more than 160 people who were struck by bullets. Related Articles

248,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/san-francisco-homeless-count.html,"Advertisement Supported by California Today Tuesday: Data kept by the city reveals a more alarming portrait than a point-in-time count. Also: The streaming era has arrived. By Jill Cowan Good morning. Today, we’re starting with a dispatch from my colleague Thomas Fuller, who’s based in the Bay Area: Many cities across California this year announced sharp increases in homelessness. Yet data from San Francisco suggest the real picture might be a lot worse. For years, city governments have measured homelessness by sending out volunteers on a single night to count, as best they could, the number of homeless people they found on the streets or in shelters. By this method San Francisco this year reported 8,011 homeless people, a 17 percent increase over 2017, the last time a count was conducted. [Read more about why homeless populations in cities around the state have surged.] But San Francisco has another, arguably more comprehensive, way of measuring homelessness, and the results are even more alarming. Over the course of a full year, the city counted twice as many homeless people — 17,595 people, a 30 percent jump from the previous year. The data, which are rarely cited in debates on homelessness, come from a city database of homeless people who receive health care and other services from the city. The latest data are from the 2019 fiscal year, which ended in June. If people sought services multiple times during the course of the year they are counted only once. The 30 percent jump was by far the largest increase of the last eight years, according to the city’s data. Rachael Kagan, the spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Public Health, says this is partly because in the 2019 fiscal year the city conducted an assessment “blitz,” proactively seeking out homeless people at shelters and hospitals. For around 1,272 people, it was the first time they were entered into the city’s databases. There is no perfect way to measure homelessness, which by nature is transient. Ms. Kagan believes the higher numbers are the “most complete picture that we have” of homelessness. But she says it is still likely to be an underestimate. “It does not include people who did not seek services, so it is still an incomplete picture,” she said.

Elizabeth Warren rolled out a new plan to tackle the threat of white supremacy on Tuesday. She blasted White House adviser Stephen Miller as a ""white supremacist"" and pledged to use ""every tool"" available to combat white nationalist violence if she wins the White House in 2020. The Democratic presidential candidate listed a spate of racially motivated attacks in the last five years: the 2015 South Carolina church shooting; the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue attack; and the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas that targeted Latinos and killed 22 people back in August. Warren said President Trump failed to address the threat of future attacks — and promised to shore up resources at the FBI and the Justice Department to renew their focus on domestic terrorism. In the Medium post, Warren charged Trump with fanning the flames of hate by drawing closer to white nationalists and placing some like Miller into positions of considerable power and influence. ""Unfortunately, the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and affiliated violent extremists. Donald Trump has openly stoked these fires,"" Warren wrote in the plan. ""He has cozied up to white nationalists — even hiring some, like Stephen Miller, into his White House."" Miller, the architect of Trump's hardline immigration agenda, has faced increasing pressure to resign from the White House. Last week, a bombshell report from the Southern Poverty Law Center revealed he had exchanged links promoting white nationalist theories with a reporter from Breitbart, a right-wing publication. The email trove dated back to the period between 2015 and 2016 when Miller served as a policy aide to Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Miller shared links to white nationalist websites and encouraged the site to draw parallels between immigration and ""Camp of the Saints,"" a notoriously racist 1970s novel. Several prominent Democrats called on Miller to resign, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The New York congresswoman slammed Miller as ""a bonafide white nationalist."" The White House, however, stood behind Miller, telling The New York Times that the SPLC ""libels, slanders and defames conservatives."" After the mass shooting in El Paso, Warren condemned Trump as a white supremacist in an interview with The Times, saying he had ""given aid and comfort"" to their ranks. Other Democratic candidates also labeled Trump as a white supremacist at the time. Last year, the FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes in the United States. And during a September address, then-acting secretary of homeland security Kevin McAleenan described white nationalism as ""one of the most dangerous threats to the United States,"" the Washington Post reported.",2019-11-19 11:20:29,Elizabeth Warren calls out Trump adviser Stephen Miller as a 'white nationalist' in new plan to combat hate,"politics and government,united states politics and government,elections",18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

Wbillado R. Varela Jr., 43, shot his wife, Rebecca N. Vescio Varela, 31, and her boyfriend Aubrey P. Perkins, 39, in the store parking lot on Monday, authorities said. Video footage reveals that Vescio Varela and Perkins entered Walmart and went to the store's money center. When they returned to their car, Varela got out of a car parked in front of them and fired several rounds into the windshield before shooting himself. Both Varela and Vescio Varela were residents of Duncan, a city of approximately 25,000 people about 80 miles south of Oklahoma City. Perkins was a resident of Minco, about 60 miles away. 'These people need to go on': El Paso Walmart reopens months after mass shooting Despite initial reports that a man with a gun intervened to end the shooting, police said the man approached the scene after Varela had already turned the gun on himself. ""We believe he did not actually get in contact with Varela. Mr. Varela had already turned and shot himself,"" lead investigator Lt. John Byers said at a press conference Tuesday. There was never a shooter inside the store. ""It appears right now to be a domestic dispute,"" Byers said. The investigation is ongoing. New Jersey shooting: Five men charged in shooting at high school football game Police responded to the scene around 9:30 a.m. Monday, within one minute of the first 911 call, Byers said. Police found Perkins and Vescio Varela dead in the front seat of a car. Varela was found at the back of the car, near a semiautomatic handgun that still had ammunition in it, police said. At least one of the victims had a child or children, Byers said, but no children witnessed the shooting. Police were still investigating whether Varela had military training or criminal history. It was not immediately clear how long he had been waiting in the other car. Byers said that Varela had been involved in local charitable organizations. ""It’s a tragedy for anyone, especially the Latin community,"" he said. Vescio Varela had been an employee of Walmart but was not on shift at the time of the shooting, Byers said.

John Byers said all gunshots were fired in the parking lot — not the store — yesterday. pic.twitter.com/qFaRdAxd1u Schools in the city were briefly locked down following the shooting. A large portion of the shopping center parking lot – surrounding a bullet-riddled vehicle – was cordoned off for most of the day. Walmart spokesman Payton McCormick told USA TODAY that no staff members were involved in the shooting or injured, and the store was not evacuated. Police said Tuesday that one exit to the store had remained open and the store had continued to do business. A local church held a community prayer service Monday night, police said. The shooting took place days after the reopening of a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that had been the scene of a mass shooting Aug. 3. That attack left 22 people dead in the parking lot and inside the Cielo Vista Supercenter. The shooting also followed mass shootings in California at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita and at a football party in Fresno.

257,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/11/19/youre-not-hearing-mass-shooting-fresno/,"This particular bit of awful news out of Fresno, California broke on Sunday evening and at first, it caused quite a stir in the media. A mass shooting had taken place in the back yard of a family home where a group of people had gathered to watch football. Multiple gunmen entered the yard through a side gate and without saying a word began firing into the crowd. When they fled there were four dead and six more injured. People were justifiably horrified. (Associated Press) A close-knit Hmong community was in shock after gunmen burst into a California backyard gathering and shot 10 men, killing four. “We are right now just trying to figure out what to do, what are the next steps. How do we heal, how do we know what’s going on,” said Bobby Bliatout, a community leader… “Our community is in mourning, and we still don’t know what’s going on, or who are the suspects,” said Pao Yang, CEO of the Fresno Center, a Hmong community group. This shooting qualified for multiple Breaking News announcements on cable news and announcements arriving in people’s email inboxes. And then a strange thing seemed to happen. By Monday morning there was almost no additional coverage. I think I saw it mentioned briefly twice on CNN, and then it was back to the impeachment hearings pretty much non-stop. With ten people shot and four killed, this obviously meets the media’s current definition of a mass shooting. So where was the outrage? Where were the calls for new gun control laws? How did this tragedy turn into a non-story? First of all, the victims were all adult males from the Hmong community. And while police said they didn’t find any ties to gang activity among the victims, they were looking into a recent “disturbance” between some of them and members of one of the local Hmong gangs. (Fresno has had problems with gang violence, including Hmong groups, for quite a while now.) Another factor is the fact that police reported the assailants using semiautomatic handguns. The event was reportedly over pretty quickly, so they probably weren’t using collections of extended magazines. In other words, this mass shooting is uninteresting to much of the media because it fails all the normal tests and doesn’t fit in with the narrative. Had the men at least been using “assault rifles” they might have merited a bit more coverage. But those events are vanishingly rare because most gang members are well aware that it’s tough to hide a long gun when walking down the street to attack someone or while fleeing the scene afterward. Further, if initial reports prove accurate, this was an incident of adult Asian people shooting other adult Asian people. And most of the press has about as much interest in that story as one where black gang members are shooting other black people. In short… basically none. It’s reminiscent of the Bunny Friend Park shooting in New Orleans back in 2015. It was the second-largest mass shooting of the year in the United States. Seventeen people were shot in the middle of a public festival but if you didn’t live in New Orleans or subscribe to the Times-Picayune, you probably never heard about it. Why? Because it was two rival gangs composed primarily of African-Americans settling a turf war. Unfortunately, they were such poor marksmen that almost all of the victims were bystanders, including a young boy who was shot through the spine and will likely spend his life in a wheelchair. So the Fresno shooting has effectively already gone down the memory hole, while the last school shooting (that claimed fewer victims) is still popping up in the news a week later. There’s no real underlying lesson here that we didn’t already know about. I only bring it up as a useful data point for future reference. The police still have no suspects identified in the Fresno shooting, but hopefully, progress will be made. We should send out our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families.

One's friend was killed in Columbine. Now two Colorado state representatives disagree on how to prevent future mass shootings From a distance, Democrat Tom Sullivan and Republican Patrick Neville appear to share many similarities. Both men are fathers who now serve as members of the Colorado House of Representatives. Mass shootings have deeply affected them both on a personal level. But those instances of gun violence impacted the men—and their views on gun control—in vastly different ways. Now Colorado's debate on its Red Flag law has pitted the two against each other.  60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley reported on the law, which allows authorities to obtain a type of civil protective order, known as an extreme risk protection order (ERPO), from a judge. With an ERPO, law enforcement can temporarily remove firearms from people deemed an immediate threat to themselves or others.  Sullivan made the Red Flag law part of his campaign for office in 2018. ""I would tell them, 'Day one, I'm running an extreme risk protection order to save lives,'"" he told Pelley. ""There isn't a single voter in House District 37 that didn't know exactly what I was going to do as soon as I got sworn in here."" Sullivan's dedication to the Red Flag law—and for holding the public office that helped him pass it—was born out of tragedy. His son, Alex, was killed in the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, which left 12 people dead and 58 wounded. Following his son's death, Sullivan became an advocate for stronger gun legislation in Colorado. He told Pelley he realized writing op-eds and speaking at press conferences would only get him so far. ""It became very clear to me that, if I really want to change something, I've actually got to get inside the building where the laws are being made,"" he said. Sullivan told Pelley he believes the Red Flag law will help prevent other fathers from losing their children to gun violence.   Neville's experience with another Colorado mass shooting also affected him. He was a student at Columbine High School during the 1999 shooting, which left 13 students dead, including his close friend. Neville told Pelley the shooting influenced his opinions of gun ownership and public safety. ""The first time that I really formed a strong opinion on it was after I was in college,"" he said. ""So if there was one place that I really didn't feel safe and that I really did feel vulnerable, it was definitely on the school campuses, sitting in those large classrooms. And not being able to protect myself really concerned me."" Now the minority leader in Colorado's House and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, Neville told Pelley his issue with Colorado's Red Flag law is that it does not address the problem. ""The end result is just they take their guns away, but the person's still there,"" Neville said. ""They could get a truck, plow into a group of people, like we see terrorists doing in Europe. Knives, bombs—there's all sort of different ways they could hurt people."" Neville told Pelley one of his issues with the law is that, when law enforcement removes a person's firearms, they can provide information about where to seek mental and behavioral health care, but the law does not mandate those health resources. All of Colorado's Republican lawmakers voted against the Red Flag bill, which Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, signed into law in April. In May, Neville and two other Republican lawmakers joined with the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a conservative gun rights advocacy organization, to file a lawsuit in an attempt to overturn the law, arguing that Democrats failed to follow proper legislative procedure. The group also temporarily backed a recall effort against Sullivan.  ""This is what really drew us to these two individuals: the fact that they both serve in the state legislature, the fact that they both have been so deeply affected by a mass shooting,"" said 60 Minutes producer Ashley Velie, who worked with Pelley on the report. ""But yet, they're really ending up at opposite ends of the issue and fighting it very passionately on both sides."" Colorado's Red Flag law is set to go into effect in on January 1, 2020.

259,https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/19/trump-supporters-binghamton-university-safety/,"Via Young America's Foundation Video Following harassment by a leftist mob, and fearing for their safety, Binghamton University Republicans travel through campus accompanied by their peers, which they refer to as “packs.” The students took these new measures after they were surrounded by an angry mob of 200 people on Thursday and had to be escorted to safety by campus police. What started as chants, name-calling, and demands to “pack up” and leave from the mob, escalated to destroying merchandise, overturning the display table, and yelling in the students’ faces.  At the time this incident occurred, Turning Point USA and College Republicans were tabling on campus to promote an upcoming event scheduled for the following week. The marketing strategy included handing out hot chocolate and adorning a table they had set up with conservative-themed posters and merchandise. (RELATED: Conservative Activist Gets Punched In The Face At Turning Point USA Event At UC Berkeley) Some of those adornments, however, invited the ire of the left-wing students. For example, a poster supporting gun rights caused offense as it was displayed on the same day that three were killed in a mass shooting at a California high school. The most inciting of all to the left-wing students, as text messages obtained by the Daily Caller show, were the displays supportive of President Donald Trump. “I heard there are only like 3 supporters there,” one student said in “The Culture,” a progressive group chat at Binghamton. Another responded, “yeah there’s not that many but fuck em up anyways.” Those three “Trump supporters” were Lacey Kestecher, John Restuccia and another student Republican. The text messages were first reported by the Binghamton Review, a student-run, campus news organization. The psychological repercussions of being trapped in an angry mob were such that, following this incident, the conservative students now avoid the main areas of their campus and use the outskirts to find their way to class. The students also do not travel alone on campus. (RELATED: Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens Harassed By Protesters) “I do not feel safe on this campus at all. I do not. My parents are concerned my parents want my location at all times right now, my brothers are beyond worried.  They don’t know what’s going to happen I don’t know what’s going to happen,” said the president of the TPUSA chapter, Lacey Kestecher. To add insult to this injury, the university said they will not bring disciplinary action against the protesters, nor will they investigate the matter, though a state assemblyman has demanded answers about the university’s response to the incident. Via Author Nonetheless, the conservative leaders will not allow the intimidation to halt their activism. Rather, they say, the antagonism pushes them to fight with more enthusiasm. (RELATED: Candace Owens Tells The Story Of Breakfast Antifa Mob) “These people are trying to invoke terror and fear — they’re bullies at the end of the day trying to kick us off campus because they don’t like the ideas we have to say,” said the president of the Republican club, John Restuccia. “It has had the opposite effect.” ",2019-11-19 16:39:55,Trump Supporters At Binghamton University Travel In ‘Packs’ For Safety After Being Mobbed By Leftists,,18775,http://dailycaller.com

It's Ashley, and I read a ton of news today so you don't have to. Let's do this. But first, cats, but like, human cats: A furry Taylor Swift is back in a new ""Cats"" trailer, and Twitter is already having a field day with it. The Short List newsletter is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe here! See the image up top? 👆 That’s Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council expert who testified Tuesday that he considered President Donald Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Joe and Hunter Biden as a ""demand"" that was ""improper"" for Trump to make. If you’re saying to yourself, “I don't know who this man is. Sorry to this man,” you’re not alone: Trump says he doesn’t know him either. ""I don't know Vindman at all,"" Trump said Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. ""I never heard of him."" Along with Vindman, other witnesses at the House committee impeachment hearing included Jennifer Williams, Kurt Volker and Tim Morrison. Here are several takeaways from Tuesday's hearings. Two federal prison officers were charged Tuesday with falsifying records, stating they had checked on accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in the hours before he hanged himself in his cell. Federal prosecutors alleged that the officers ""browsed the Internet"" and lingered in a common area when they should have been conducting inmate checks. The two officers signed ""false certifications"" attesting they had made their required rounds, according to court records. Before New York's chief medical examiner concluded that Epstein hanged himself, the disgraced financier's death was shadowed by conspiracy theories, some suggesting Epstein didn't kill himself. Security was tightened across the Syracuse University campus Tuesday after a white supremacist manifesto was posted on a campus forum and reportedly ""airdropped"" to some student's cellphones, the latest in a series of almost daily racist episodes that have sparked days of protests at the university. The school newspaper, the Daily Orange, said the manifesto was a 74-page document written by the perpetrator of the deadly mosque shootings in New Zealand this year. The shooter emailed the hate-laced manifesto to dozens minutes before the attack. Gov. Andrew Cuomo blasted Syracuse Chancellor Kent Syverud’s handling of the situation Tuesday, saying he has failed to ""instill confidence"" as the school deals with the racist incidents. Nearly every animal on the endangered species list is threatened by human-caused climate change, but federal agencies aren't doing enough to protect those species, a new study says. Researchers examined the 459 U.S. endangered animal species to gauge their sensitivity to climate change and their ability to survive, based on federal plans to protect them. The study found that 99.8% of the species possess a trait that could make it challenging for them to adapt to global warming. More than two years after a shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas left more than 50 people dead, a woman who was paralyzed in the attack has died, a coroner said. Kimberly Gervais, 57, was shot and suffered a spinal injury in the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in 2017 when 58 people were killed and hundreds were wounded. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Gervais' sister, Dena Sarvela, said the stress from her injuries became too much for Gervais' body to handle.

262,https://www.theroot.com/why-stephen-miller-s-emails-are-white-nationalism-expla-1839946285,"Racist baby, it’s been a while! Why do you look so sad? Why would a musician have to stop making music? Oh no, my little racist toddler friend. I think you’re conflating the Steve Miller Band with White House adviser and founding member of the Hair Club for White Supremacists, Stephen Miller. The Steve Miller band made “Fly Like an Eagle” and “Take the Money and Run.” OK, that’s notorious racist Stephen Miller. He’s responsible for rounding up child immigrants as part of his white nationalist immigration policy. He’s been racist for a long time and the Southern Poverty Law Center recently received 900 leaked emails Miller sent to writers at the far-right news site Breitbart. Of course he does. But your dad works on the lumber aisle at Home Depot and Stephen Miller creates immigration policy for the Trump administration. These particular emails gave us a look inside the mind of a white nationalist and reveal Miller’s motivations, inspiration and desire to merge ethno-nationalism and American policy. Again, you little neophyte Nazi, Steve Miller is not Stephen Miller! The former is a great singer/songwriter and the latter is a not-so-undercover white supremacist! The one whose hairline doesn’t want to be associated with him is the racist. For instance, here’s an email Stephen Miller wrote about the Confederate flag: From: Stephen MillerJune 23, 2015, 10:34 p.m. what do the [Confederate monument] vandals say to the people fighting and dying overseas in uniform right now who are carrying on a seventh or eighth generation of military service in their families, stretching back to our founding? Also, I get former and latter mixed up, too. But your dad’s heritage is hate. If your dad’s lineage dates back to the Revolutionary War, then the British considered your American ancestors to be traitors. If his lineage dates back to the Civil War, then your forefathers literally committed treason and started a race war so they could own slaves. The Confederate States of America was an attempt to create a white supremacist society by any means necessary, even if it included killing their own countrymen. Well, here’s another defending the Confederate flag: From: Stephen Miller, June 24, 2015, 2:07 p.m. ET: 1. Should people of Spanish descent, especially those living in immigrant communities, be banned from displaying the Spanish flag given Spanish conduct in Latin America? 2. Should [Univision anchor] Jorge Ramos apologize for Spanish conduct in Latin America, and redress it by ensuring more people of indigenous backgrounds have hosting duties on his network? 3. Should the cross be removed from immigrant communities, in light of the history of Spanish conquest? And another defending the Civil War. From: Stephen MillerJune 23, 2015, 3:10 p.m. ET: ‘22.6 percent of Southern men who were between the ages of 20 and 24 in 1860 lost their lives because of the war.’ Does Stephen Miller seem like the kind of guy who watches Hee Haw? His ancestors immigrated to New York from Russia in 19o6 to escape Jewish persecution. He has absolutely no connection to Confederates, the South or even pre-slavery America.  Miller’s only connection to these people is their desire to create a white country, which Miller values above all else. He is defending treason and racism, not heritage, which makes him a traitor to his people and his country. That’s why he’s not a “nationalist,” he’s a “white nationalist.” He wants a white nation. Well, no. These emails just offer a look inside his racist mind. The real troubling ones are the ones that show how his white supremacist leanings shape policy. For instance, here are some emails he sent to Breitbart writer and Jeff Sessions staffer Garrett Murch on immigration: From: Stephen MillerJune 2, 2015, 7:05 p.m. ET: This would seem a good opportunity to remind people about the heritage established by Calvin Coolidge, which covers four decades of the 20th century. From: Garrett Murch:Aug. 4, 2015, 6:22 p.m. ET: Mark Levin just said there should be no immigration for several years. Not just cut the number down from the current 1 million green cards per year. For assimilation purposes. From: Stephen MillerAug. 4, 2015, 6:23 p.m. ET: Like Coolidge did. Kellyanne Conway poll says that is exactly what most Americans want after 40 years of non-stop record arrivals. Sure he is. Probably because he once wrote: “There are racial considerations too grave to be brushed aside for any sentimental reasons. Biological laws tell us that certain divergent people will not mix or blend.” Miller repeatedly refers to the 1924 Immigration Act because it is the model for racist immigration laws. The Coolidge-backed legislation cut immigration, created an “Asiatic Exclusion Zone” that barred Asian immigrants that is much like Trump’s travel ban. The law was based on eugenics—the idea that some races are smarter and more valuable than others. Coolidge also believed this, writing that “observance of ethnic law is as great a necessity to a nation as immigration law.” This is why he is a post-Civil War favorite of racists, including Miller. Miller repeatedly refers to Coolidge and the 1924 law in emails. Here’s one about the Statue of Liberty: From: Stephen MillerSept. 13, 2015, 7:53 p.m. ET: this is a good chance to expose that ridiculous statue of liberty myth. Poem has nothing to do with it: [Link] Indeed, two decades after poem was added, Coolidge shut down immigration. No one said he was violating the Statue of Liberty’s purpose. BTW: have you noticed how [Ben] Carson and [Carly] Fiorina are preening [Marco] Rubio-like daily in front of the media to show them how they are good and decent Republicans unlike Mr. Trump? Finally, speaking of refugees, did you see the expanded list I emailed of foreign-born terrorists on Friday afternoon?” Well...yes. But it’s not just racists from the past. He also has an affinity for white supremacist organizations from the present, like the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a propaganda-producing “think tank” designated as a hate group bu the SPLC. It was founded to keep out non-white immigrants and push the “white genocide” theory—that white people are going to go extinct unless they stop immigration, put an end to race-mixing and increase white-on-white fucking. He pushed this study to a Breitbart writer to show the dangerous rise in non-white immigration: From: Miller,Aug. 12, 2015, 3:13 p.m. ET: This is a Center for Immigration Studies report, embargoed until 1am Thursday night (i.e. tonight at 1am). He also pushed propaganda from white supremacist website VDARE, which is like CIS on steroids. Miller was worried that Mexicans would get Temporary Protected Status (TPS) that would allow Mexicans to live and work in America if  they crossed the border because of Hurricane Patricia, so when a Breitbart writer contacted him, Miller sent this VDARE link, adding: “And they will all get TPS. And all the ones here will get TPS too. That needs to be the weekend’s BIG story. TPS is everything.” Miller also: It’s not just that he’s racist. It’s that he’s making his dreams become reality. He is the person in the Trump administration most responsible for the travel ban, the child detention camps, hiring 10,000 I.C.E. officers and so much more. His entire premise rests on being cruel to non-white people, hoping it will deter them from even attempting to come to America. He is the wizard behind the mask who’s pushing the buttons. Again, racist baby, it’s not the same guy. Where’d you read that? Makes sense. I think even a racist five year old would have to ask if Stephen Miller is absolutely certain that Jews are 100% white even though most white supremacists would say that they are not? I mean this guy is out here fulfilling most of the stereotypes about us. He’s a weird, hairless goblin like creature who skulks around influencing the government from the shadows while sacrificing the blood of Catholic children in the detainment camps. He’s probably as corrupt as everyone else in the White House. How long does he think the MAGA crowd will put up with him when they don't need him?",2019-11-19 18:00:00,"Why Stephen Miller’s Emails Are White Nationalism Explained, Explained","blacks,music",368082,http://theroot.com/

Metro By Bernadette Hogan and Kenneth Garger Submit November 19, 2019 | 5:46pm				| Updated November 20, 2019 | 10:29am A white supremacist manifesto reportedly authored by the suspect behind the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooting was believed to be electronically distributed to students at Syracuse University early Tuesday — the latest in a series of racist episodes to rock the campus. The university’s Department of Public Safety said it was investigating reports of students at a campus library receiving the document on their cellphones via an electronic file transfer service called AirDrop. Officials noted the reports haven’t been confirmed and there is “no specific threat” to the university. But they said they’ve alerted the FBI, state police and the Syracuse Police Department. The school newspaper, the Daily Orange, reported the alleged manifesto is the same 74-page document written by Muslim-hating Brenton Tarrant, who’s accused of slaughtering 49 people at two New Zealand mosques in March. There have been 11 reported hate crimes at Syracuse University since Nov. 7, the Daily Orange said. The racist and anti-Semitic incidents led the university on Sunday to suspend all fraternity life. The DPS had said a black female student reported “being verbally harassed” Saturday night by a group yelling a racial epithet as she walked by. Following Tuesday’s incident, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the university’s board of trustees to hire an outside monitor to investigate the “surge of campus hate crimes.” “The hateful activities at Syracuse University are most disturbing, not only to the Syracuse University community, but to the greater community of New York,” Cuomo said in a press release. “That these actions should happen on the campus of a leading New York university makes this situation even worse.” Cuomo was also critical of chancellor Kent Syverud’s handling of the incidents and said, “They have not been handled in a manner that reflects this state’s aggressive opposition to such odious, reckless, reprehensible behavior.” Read Next Disgraced pol Hiram Monserrate plots latest comeback with ...

Text to Speech New York Times Australian bureau chief Damien Cave somehow keeps making it into the paper “news” pages with the same old shameless left-wing crusading against coal and mockery of conservatives: “As Australia Burns, Its Leaders Trade Insults.” The text box: “Classic pragmatism seems to stop at climate change.” The online subhead to Friday's story: “As Australia Burns, Its Leaders Trade Insults -- The country has long been a model for common-sense public policy. But this week’s fires have revealed once again that its pragmatism stops at climate change.” So what does Cave’s “common-sense” “pragmatism” entail in Australian reality? Nationalized health care and gun bans. When a mass shooting shattered Australia in 1996, the country banned automatic weapons. In its first years of independence, it enacted a living-wage law. Stable retirement savings, national health care, affordable college education -- Australia solved all these issues decades ago. But climate change is Australia’s labyrinth without an exit, where its pragmatism disappears. The wildfires that continued raging on Wednesday along the country’s eastern coast have revealed that the politics of climate in Australia resist even the severe pressure that comes from natural disaster. Instead of common-sense debate, there are culture war insults. The deputy prime minister calls people who care about climate change “raving inner-city lunatics.” Another top official suggests that supporting the Greens party can be fatal. And while the government is working to meet the immediate need -- fighting fires, delivering assistance -- citizens are left asking why more wasn’t done earlier as they demand solutions. .... But in Australia, where coal is king and water is scarce, the country’s citizens have spent the week simmering with fear, shame and alarm. As a 500-mile stretch from Sydney to Byron Bay continued to face catastrophic fire conditions, with 80 separate blazes burning and at least four deaths reported, Australians have watched, awe-struck, as life-changing destruction has been met with political sniping. Cave found someone to make a link between two liberal bogeymen: “Coal is our N.R.A.,” said Ms. Harris Rimmer, referring to the National Rifle Association, which has stymied changes to gun laws in the United States even as mass shootings have become shockingly common. “They have total control over Parliament.” Cave again insisted that banning coal would be no big deal in Australia (never mind that radical environmental groups he supports, like Extinction Rebellion are against all forms of modern-day energy, not just coal).  The industry’s economic benefits reach fewer people than many Australians believe. It frequently hires federal lawmakers after they leave office, and even now politicians often defend coal in patriotic terms. For conservatives in particular, extraction of natural resources in rural areas is a stand-in for values worth fighting for against condescending urban elites. .... What’s galling for many scientists is that the public wants the federal government to do more; polls consistently show that Australians see climate change as a major threat requiring aggressive intervention. But in May, after the (conservative) Liberal Party shocked the world by winning election in Australia, Cave wrote under a Times headline whining that voters didn’t care for the activist climate agenda of the left-leaning Labor Party: “It Was Supposed to Be Australia’s Climate Change Election. What Happened?” Earlier this month Cave defended the disruptive activists who make up the Extinction Rebellion climate cult. An August 2018 story by Cave, under the headline “Coal Lobby Turns Up Heat, and Australia Wilts Under Climate Change” had nearly an identical theme as this one. The text box reproached the country: “A progressive nation remains in thrall to the energy industry.”  The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where

Douglas Haig, 57, of Mesa, Arizona, became the first and only person arrested and charged in connection with the Oct. 1, 2017, massacre, which ended when the gunman, Stephen Paddock, killed himself. Haig told reporters following his arrest early last year that none of the surplus military ammunition he sold to Paddock in September 2017 was ever fired during the killing spree, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Haig said he had no inkling of any criminal intent by his customer, recounting that Paddock said he planned to use the magnesium-packed tracer bullets to put on a “light show.” Although the case against Haig stemmed from the federal investigation of the shooting, authorities never accused Haig of conspiring in the attack. But prosecutors said Haig’s fingerprints were found on some of the unfired rounds in Paddock’s hotel suite and that armor-piercing cartridges recovered there bore tool marks matching equipment in Haig’s suburban Phoenix workshop. Haig pleaded guilty to a single count of engaging in the business of manufacturing ammunition without a license, a federal firearms felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The plea deal also requires Haig to forfeit his existing inventory of ammo and presumably should end his career in bullets for good, as the agreement stipulates it would be a felony for him to possess ammunition or firearms in the future. Sentencing is set for Feb. 19, 2020. No motive for the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas has ever been established. Paddock strafed a crowed of concert-goers with rapid-fire gunshots from his high-rise suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel before police stormed his room to find the 64-year-old retiree dead. Fifty-eight victims were killed outright, and 500 others were injured. A 59th person, Kimberly Gervais, 57, who suffered a spinal wound in the shooting, died on Friday, according to the coroner in San Bernardino County, California. Haig’s lawyer, Mark Victor, has said the casualty toll would have been lower had tracer rounds sold to Paddock been used because victims would have seen the trajectory of the gunfire in the dark and been able to take cover more easily. According to court documents, Haig operated an unlicensed ammo business called Specialized Military Ammunition, selling his wares over the internet. He also promoted and sold ammunition he made at gun shows in Arizona and other states, occasionally shipping bullets to customers in Nevada. The 720 tracer rounds he sold to Paddock were purchased and delivered to Paddock at Haig’s home.

RODRIGUEZ FRESNO — A close-knit Hmong community was in shock after gunmen burst into a California backyard gathering and shot 10 men, killing four, including a popular singer who used to live in Long Beach. “We are right now just trying to figure out what to do, what are the next steps. How do we heal, how do we know what’s going on,” said Bobby Bliatout, a community leader. Sunday evening’s attack killed Xy Lee, a Hmong singer and musician ― and a former Long Beach resident — whose videos on YouTube have been viewed millions of times. Also killed were Phia Vang, 31; Kou Xiong, 38; and Kalaxang Thao, 40, all of Fresno, according to the coroner’s office. Three others remained hospitalized in serious condition, Community Regional Medical Center said in a statement.

(Courtesy photo)  Police have not determined a motive and no suspects were identified. At a vigil Monday evening, relatives of Xiong set a table with photos, incense, and white candles outside the house. Xiong is survived by a wife and young daughter, according to a GoFundMe page. It describes him as “a humble, kind, and caring individual who was always willing to help those in need.” “Everybody is crying, our whole city is crying for these families,” said a sobbing Paula Yang, a friend of Xiong’s brother. Xiong’s uncle, Neej Xiong, prayed on his hands and knees. “It should’ve been me, not you,” Neej said. The Hmong are an ethnic group from Southeast Asia. Many fled after fighting alongside the United States during the Vietnam War. There are about 300,000 Hmong living in the U.S., according to the 2017 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. California has the nation’s largest Hmong population and about 25,000 live in Fresno, comprising about 5% of the city’s population of 525,000. The gunmen targeted a house where about 16 men had gathered outside to watch football on television, police said. Women and children had already moved inside. At least two men armed with semi-automatic handguns walked through a side gate and began firing randomly into the crowd before fleeing in the darkness, Police Chief Andrew Hall said. The shooters did not speak. Witnesses saw only flashes when the pistols were fired, Hall said. Police were investigating whether the shooting was connected to a recent disturbance involving some of the people at the party, Hall said. He did not describe the incident other than to say it occurred within the last week. Women and children inside the house weren’t hit, Hall said. The chief said at least 60 officers were investigating along with the FBI, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While police hadn’t found any gang connections to the victims, Hall also announced the establishment of an Asian gang task force over concerns about retaliation or more violence ahead of the Hmong New Year, which is celebrated next month. There have been 11 violent incidents related to Asian gangs in the city this year, three in November, police said. An Asian-American man was shot to death at a home earlier Sunday but police had not linked that killing to the party attack, Hall said. “This is truly a good group of people who were simply having a party,” the chief said. It was the third mass shooting in four days in California. Last Thursday, a 16-year-old boy armed with a handgun killed two students and wounded three others at his high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita before killing himself. On Saturday, a San Diego man killed his estranged wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son was on life-support. There have been eight mass killings in California so far this year, claiming the lives of 33 people, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. That’s a dramatic increase from previous years, with eight mass killings for all of 2016-2018. Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet has reportedly told his junior staff and readers that the paper's news coverage won't openly side with particular Democratic candidates for president, despite pressure from those constituencies to do so. In a profile of Baquet, The Guardian reported that Baquet told staffers ""the outlet would lose its status if it openly sided with particular politicians."" The piece implied that Baquet had been pressured to approve coverage favorable to Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., but did not provide details. ""They probably want a more political New York Times than I’m willing to give them,"" Baquet said of those staffers. ""I hope they will learn over time that a New York Times that plays it straight has much more power and much more longevity."" NEW YORK TIMES BANS REPORTERS FROM CNN'S DON LEMON, MSNBC'S MADDOW SHOWS FOR BEING 'TOO PARTISAN' The Times editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and for president in 2016. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. In the same piece, Baquet blasted the president's attacks on his journalists as ""unpresidential"" and equivocated on whether Trump is a racist. “I think Donald Trump says racially divisive things. I think that’s a little bit different. I’m not in his head enough to know whether he says them because he wants to stoke his base,"" he said. Baquet's comments appeared to reflect his concern about a widespread perception that the Times is too biased. Vanity Fair previously reported that Baquet expressed concerns that reporters who appeared on certain cable news shows would be ""perceived as being aligned"" with the show's politics. The interview also offered a glimpse into the Times' leadership as it faced growing criticism and boycotts from both sides of the ideological spectrum.

268,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/609634018/0/phoenix/nation~Undercover-FBI-agents-say-Chicago-college-student-tried-to-write-code-for-ISIS/,"CHICAGO — A 20-year-old U.S. college student was arrested Monday for allegedly writing computer code to help the Islamic State spread propaganda online, according to the FBI. Thomas Osadzinski, a student at DePaul University who lives in the city's northside neighborhood of Buena Park, was charged in a federal criminal complaint with one count of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — a charge punishable by up to 20 years. Osadzinski appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cole in Chicago Tuesday and was ordered held without bond. According to the complaint, Osadzinski designed a process that uses a computer script to make ISIS propaganda easier to access and disseminate on a social media platform, bypassing preventive code which routinely removes ISIS content due to the violent nature of the materials. Pentagon: President Trump's order to withdraw troops from Syriaallows ISIS to rebuild The complaint, however, did not identify the social media platform, saying only that it was a mobile and desktop messaging application. Osadzinski earlier this year shared his script — and instructions for how to use it — with individuals whom he believed to be ISIS supporters and members of pro-ISIS media organizations, the complaint says. Those individuals were actually covert FBI employees and a person working with them. Osadzinski was born in Park Ridge, Illinois. Agents began tracking him in June of 2018, when Osadzinski posted in a pro-ISIS chatroom, according to the complaint. Osadzinski, unsolicited, began reaching out to pro-ISIS media platforms and offering to help translate videos from Arabic to English. “I know English well. If you need help tell me&mldr” he wrote to an agent in Arabic on the social media platform. Osadzinski later told an agent that he had done the English voice-over for a pro-ISIS video, as well as translations for others. The agent who reviewed the video voice-over concluded that the narrator spoke English with an American accent. Osadzinski continued to communicate with at least four undercover agents over the months-long investigation, despite telling them that he knew the FBI was monitoring him. ""Once I get my gun and explosive belt, the mukhabarat will never get me,"" Osadzinski wrote to an agent, using the Arabic word for state security and intelligence services. American ISIS fighter: To be repatriated to U.S., Turkey says Osadzinski told one agent that learning computer skills was ""very useful for jihad,"" according to the complaint. At one point, Osadzinski sent an agent a screenshot of a social media channel that he had created, which appeared to contain thousands of photos, videos, files, audio clips, and links. Osadzinski slowly revealed that he kept pro-ISIS materials in his 13th-floor apartment. Osadzinski sent one agent a photo of a large poster with Quranic verses written on it, telling the agent that he had printed it out at the university library. Osadzinski later sent another photo, of an ISIS flag lying on his desktop computer. According to the complaint, Osadzinski appeared to be inspired by the 2009 attack at Fort Hood, Texas, when an Army psychiatrist fatally shot 13 people in the deadliest mass shooting on an American military base. The shooter had shouted “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest” in Arabic) during the attack, later calling it retaliation for U.S. wars in the Muslim world. Following the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi last month, Osadzinski, unprompted, sent a message to one agent announcing his allegiance to the new leader of ISIS. In February, an information technology professional who had met Osadzinski through his computer science studies called the student under the guise of discussing computer science programs. The source befriended Osadzinski and falsely told him that he, too, was an ISIS supporter. The source met with Osadzinski in person five times. The two became close. Osadzinski told the source about his plans to meet up with his prospective spouse in Indonesia. He detailed his research into the FBI agent that he suspected was tailing him, revealing that he knew details about the agent's father. Osadzinski also showed the source screenshots of messages he had sent to individuals in Chechnya, instructing them on how to use the code. The confidential source has been involved with multiple FBI investigations since 2013 and has been paid approximately $350,000, according to the complaint, DePaul University confirmed that Osadzinski is a currently enrolled student. ""We recognize the seriousness of the charges and would cooperate with authorities if contacted,"" the university told USA TODAY. According to Osadzinski's LinkedIn profile, he currently works in IT at DePaul and previously worked as an Electronic Sales Associate at Target. He lists skills in Java and Python programming languages. While his profile also lists past employment as a software tester at software developer Cylance Inc., the company said it had no record of Osadzinski ever having worked there. Osadzinski is scheduled to appear for a detention hearing Friday.",2019-11-19 19:57:57,Undercover FBI agents say Chicago college student tried to write code for ISIS,"politics and government,computers and the internet,armament, defense and military forces,terrorism,crime and criminals",25128,http://www.azcentral.com

They said the suspect was a student and he carried out the attack on his birthday. By Jill Cowan, Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Jacey Fortin transcript Upon arrival within two minutes, Santa Clarita deputies recognized that it was an active shooter situation, and conducted a rapid deployment onto the school premises. When they reached the quad area, they discovered six persons who were suffering for guns — from gunshot students — excuse me, gunshot wounds. These were all students of the high school. All the students were triaged, and transported to a local hospital. The suspect was later identified as one of the victims who was found in the quad. He is identified as a 16-year-old male, whose birthday is today. The weapon that he used was recovered at the scene. It’s a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, which had no more rounds in it — had no more bullets in it. Detectives have reviewed the video at the scene, which clearly shows the subject in the quad withdraw a handgun from his backpack, shoot and wound five people and then shoot himself in the head. I regret to say that at 9:23 this morning, one of the female victims, age 16, passed away. Her parents are at the hospital. There is another female victim, age 14. Another female victim age, 15, and two male victims, each 14 years of age. A 16-year-old student pulled a handgun from his backpack at a high school in Santa Clarita, Calif., on Thursday morning and shot five students, killing two, the authorities said. The gunman was in grave condition after shooting himself in the head, they said. The suspect has not been identified, but the police said that he was a student at the school, Saugus High School, and that Thursday was his birthday. The students who died were a 15-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy, the authorities said. The other victims, all injured by gunfire, were identified as a 14-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. The gunman fired a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol in the quad of the school just after 7:30 a.m. and it was caught on video, said Capt. Kent Wegener of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. He added that there were no bullets in the gun when it was recovered. Medical staff transferred the suspect to the hospital before the police had identified him, Captain Wegener said. Capt. Wegener said the gunman’s girlfriend and mother were with detectives at a Santa Clarita police station. Officers also searched the suspect’s home, he said, which is less than two miles from the school. Images from the scene showed paramedics transporting the wounded on stretchers, outdoor tables littered with the backpacks of students who had fled, and tear-filled reunions between parents and students. Sherri Risley, 50, said her daughter, who is 16, had known the suspect since elementary school. “You grew up with someone your whole life, and then this happens, and it’s really close and it’s surreal,” Ms. Risley said. Another student, Sharon Orelana Cordova, told KNBC-TV that she hid under a table in a nurse’s office until police officers came to get her. “When I got out, I saw this person lying on the ground,” she said, “with blood all over.” Santa Clarita is home to many firefighters, police officers and other emergency workers, some of whom dropped their children off at the school and may have also responded to the shooting to aid the authorities, said Alex Villanueva, the county sheriff. Saugus High School, tucked in a suburban Southern California neighborhood of ranch homes below brown, rolling hills, was surrounded by a swarm of S.U.V.s from the police, the sheriff’s office and the highway patrol. Clusters of officers holding long guns stood around the campus, where murals read “California Distinguished School.” Tristan Aguirre, a 17-year-old senior, said he was in English class when he heard shots, a situation the students had prepared for in shooting drills. “It’s the world now,” he said. “The world now is weird.” Samuel Arreaza, a 15-year-old sophomore, said he was about to head into school when he saw police cars, and his phone started “exploding.” A friend was sheltering in the library. Samuel said he turned around and stayed in his house. His parents said it was the only time they would not yell at him for being late to school. Samuel said that he grew up in Santa Clarita and that it was a peaceful, laid-back community. The students at Saugus had done active shooter drills, and he “grew up knowing this is a thing that happens.” Now those conversations will be more real. Lucy Gulley, 47, lives up the street from the school and was taking her younger son, who is 11, to junior high nearby when she saw students running. At first, she told her son they were goofing around. But then she saw panic on their faces. She and her husband invited several students into their home to call their parents. “It’s very emotional,” she said. “You just automatically get into the state of mind where you put your child in that situation.” Jeremy Thompson’s two sons attend Saugus High School, and he said he first learned about the shooting when his younger son, a sophomore, called him early on Thursday morning. Mr. Thompson said his older son, a senior, told him by text that he and his classmates had barricaded themselves in a classroom — likely their first period class — and covered up the windows. Later, he and many other students were moved to a gymnasium by school staff, Mr. Thompson said. Cellphone reception was spotty, and Mr. Thompson said he was only getting updates from his sons intermittently — terse texts that seemed to understate the gravity of the moment. “You would expect them to be more affected, but it’s just the reality that has plagued kids for so many years at this point,” he said. Mass shootings came one after another, sometimes only hours apart, leaving a reeling nation wondering why. The sophomore told his father that there had been shots fired at school and that he was walking away from the building toward his mother’s house nearby. “Kids today, they never call, so you get this call, and you automatically wonder what it’s going to be,” Mr. Thompson said in an interview from a parent reunification center nearby. He had been at the school the night before to see one of his sons performing in a theater production of “Shakespeare in Love,” where everyone had been celebrating a successful show. “And then I come here this morning and see a bunch of them huddled together in tears,” he said of their peers. Mr. Thompson, a former Democratic staffer, said that as the names of shooting sites around the country stack up — Parkland, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas — he had just wished Santa Clarita would not be added to the list. “You just hope against hope that it’s not going to hit your school or your kids,” he said. Maxximus Almaraz, 16, said first period was just wrapping up when he heard the gunshots. At first, he thought other students were popping Doritos bags on the ground. His class barricaded the door before anyone mentioned an active shooter on the intercom, he said. Immediately, students started trying to piece together what was happening using social media, text messages and Snapchat. “At first, we were making sure everyone’s O.K.,” Maxximus said. Then the students started trying to identify the gunman. He said a photo of one student was circulated, but was quickly determined to be the wrong person. A screenshot Maxximus showed had an image of another student with text saying “please delete pic of the other kid this is the shooter.” Maxximus said he was afraid, but in the classroom, students were more shocked by the fact that their school was the latest to experience a shooting. “We weren’t saying, ‘Oh, we’re going to die,’” Maxximus said. “We were like, ‘How crazy this is happening to us.’” Mass shootings have been occurring across the country with increasing frequency. Here are some attacks that took place in California in recent years. Orinda, Oct. 31, 2019: Five people were killed and several injured at a Halloween party held at a home rented through Airbnb in the San Francisco suburb. Long Beach, Oct. 30, 2019: Three men were fatally shot and at least nine other people were injured at a Halloween house party when a gunman opened fire on the gathering from an alley. Gilroy, July 28, 2019: A man with an assault-style rifle opened fire at a festival, killing three people and wounding 13 others, and then died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging gunfire with police officers. Thousand Oaks, Nov. 7, 2018: A man set off smoke bombs to create confusion at the Borderline Bar, a country music venue, then shot a security guard at the entrance and opened fire into the crowd inside the bar, killing 12 people. He was found dead at the scene. Rancho Tehama Reserve, Nov. 14, 2017: A gunman rampaged through a small community, firing at an elementary school and several other locations, killing at least four and wounding at least 10, before he was fatally shot by the police. San Diego, April 30, 2017: A man fired a gun at a poolside party while talking on a cellphone with an ex-girlfriend, killing one person and injuring at least six, before the police shot and killed him. San Bernardino, Dec. 2, 2015: A heavily armed man and woman killed at least 14 people and wounded at least 17 at a social services center before dying in a shootout with police. Isla Vista, Calif., May 23, 2014: After stabbing three men to death in his apartment, a college student methodically opened fire on bystanders, killing three more and wounding 13. Santa Monica, June 7, 2013: Four people were killed and five wounded as a gunman walked through Santa Monica with an assault-style rifle, firing at people, cars, a public bus and buildings before being shot and killed by the police. California has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation. But like many places with strong firearms restrictions, its laws are often undermined because guns can easily be brought in from states where the laws are weaker. In July, for instance, a teenager armed with what officials later described as an AK-style semiautomatic assault rifle opened fire at a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif. The 19-year-old had legally purchased the weapon across the state line in Nevada. The authorities identified the weapon used on Thursday as a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun. It is illegal for minors to possess handguns in the state, except in very limited circumstances, and a permit is required for anyone to carry a concealed handgun. But as long as the gun’s magazine could not hold more than 10 rounds, in other respects it was probably a legal firearm in California. Proposition 63, approved after a massacre in San Bernardino, Calif. in 2015, outlawed large-capacity ammunition magazines in the state. A Federal District Court overturned that part of the law this spring, but the state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, has appealed the ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. California became the first state to ban assault weapons in 1989. It was also an early adopter of a so-called red flag law that allowed family members and law enforcement officials to petition judges to temporarily take weapons away from people who appear to be a danger to themselves and others. Other firearms restrictions that help set California apart from many other states include a 10-day waiting period for buying a weapon; limiting people to purchasing one handgun per month; and making gun buyers pass a written test and obtain a safety certificate. The state also gives local police the authority to reject applications to carry concealed weapons. And it recently increased the age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21. The state took another big step in 2016, when voters approved Proposition 63, which requires background checks not just for guns but also for ammunition sales. Mr. Becerra reported that in just one month, the new ammunition checks had blocked more than 100 felons and others barred from gun ownership from buying bullets. Mr. Becerra disclosed the numbers as part of the state’s defense against legal action taken by gun-rights groups to try to block the new ammunition background checks. Lockdown drills to prepare for shootings or other disasters have become ubiquitous in American schools; 95 percent of schools held them in 2015-2016, according to the federal government. Mental health experts have begun to raise concerns about the potential of such drills, some of which are eerily realistic, to scare or even traumatize children. At Glencoe High School in Alabama this week, the sound of gunshots rang out and students jumped out windows in a mock escape. Student actors were strapped to stretchers and loaded into waiting ambulances. In Jefferson County, Colo. — home to Columbine High School — teachers were recently given buckets and kitty litter, which could be used as toilets in the case of an extended lockdown. Teachers in West Virginia have reported that so-called “code red” drills are sometimes held without their or their students’ prior knowledge — so that they are never sure whether the terrifying threat is real. School safety is a $2.7 billion industry, with districts purchasing increasingly sophisticated technology. Some schools require visitors to scan their driver’s license or thumbprint, or submit to a facial scan. But despite the crushing tragedy of what seems like an endless string of school shootings, schools remain among the safest places for American children, who are less likely to die there than at home or in their neighborhoods. School safety experts say the most important emergencies for schools to prepare for are those that are more regular occurrences: traffic accidents, weather disasters, thefts, assaults and child abductions linked to custody battles. Some of the measures that could prevent those events, such as locking external and internal doors and signing in guests, can also help prevent or mitigate school shootings. Senator Kamala Harris of California sounded exasperated in a telephone interview on CNN, telling the anchor Anderson Cooper several times that the situation was “just tragic.” “Our kids are living in fear,” she said. “This is yet again, another reason why they are so afraid, that literally, they will die.” Other candidates also weighed in. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has called for stiff regulations including a gun licensing program, reiterated his desire to “bring a fight to the N.R.A.” Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she was “heartsick for the victims.” And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont highlighted the need for what he called “common sense” gun safety legislation. “We cannot accept this as normal,” the former housing secretary Julián Castro said. “We must act on behalf of our children.” Added the entrepreneur Andrew Yang: “As the parent of two school age boys, this is our worst nightmare come to life.” Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman from Arizona who was shot in the head by a gunman in 2011 and has since become an advocate for stricter gun-control laws, called on President Trump and Republican lawmakers to take action after what she said was the 366th mass shooting so far in 2019. “Americans have had enough of living in fear that today gun violence will change their lives,” Ms. Giffords said in a statement, adding that national leaders “can’t ignore the nightmare this public safety threat creates any longer.” Ms. Giffords called on the Senate to pass a background checks bill approved by the House in February. The bill, which would require background checks for all gun purchasers, including those at gun shows and on the internet, was the first significant gun control bill to clear the chamber in a quarter-century.The legislation was propelled by last year’s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., which prompted a wave of student-led activism that pressed Democrats to unite around gun control. “Every politician paid to defend the status quo by the gun lobby needs to answer whether they are comfortable with live shooter drills becoming routine, students running terrified from their classrooms, and entire communities being locked down,” Ms. Giffords said, adding, “How many more deaths will happen before they sign that lifesaving legislation into law?” Katie Hill, who graduated from Saugus High School in 2004 and represented the area in Congress before resigning earlier this month, said Santa Clarita has higher number of gun owners than average across the country. During her tenure, she told MSNBC, the House of Representatives passed four pieces of gun control legislation that have yet to be taken up by the Senate. “This is something that my colleagues and I talked about all the time,” she said from her backyard, as helicopters searching for the shooter circled overhead “When you go back to your communities, people want to know what you’re going to do, and we’re really stuck.” Several of her campaign interns and volunteers go to the school, she said on Twitter: “Praying for all.” Arit John, Matt Stevens, Heather Tal Murphy, Dana Goldstein, Richard A.

270,https://www.nationalmemo.com/mitch-mcconnell-piously-urges-civility-in-politics/,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called for “civility” on Monday after his reelection campaign publicly mused about the death of one of his rivals. McConnell told Kentucky residents in a speech that America has a “behavioral problem” adding, “People are acting out and it’s not, I don’t think, limited to one ideological place or another. You’ve just got a lot of people engaging in bad behavior.” Americans have to “learn how to behave better, how to be able to disagree without anger,” he said. McConnell’s comments come in stark contrast to his own words and actions. In August, McConnell’s campaign suggested that Democrat Amy McGrath, who is running against him for his Senate seat in 2020, would be buried by the self-described “Grim Reaper of socialism.” The campaign posted an image — which is still online — of McGrath’s name on a headstone, accompanied with other failed political campaigns. The stunt was done just hours after the deadly mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. After the El Paso shooting, many asked McConnell to consider gun legislation, citing the passage of a popular gun safety bill in the House that received a majority of votes. Instead, McConnell described the fight against gun violence as “theatrics.” McConnell has not courted civility with his effusive praise of Donald Trump. Just a few days ago he appeared at the White House to praise Trump’s efforts to stack the courts with conservative stalwarts, bypassing commentary on Trump’s behaviors. “You didn’t blow it,” McConnell said to Trump, describing the nomination process for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. “You made a great choice” in nominating Brett Kavanaugh he told Trump. McConnell did not demonstrate civility when he refused to hold a vote on Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s chosen nominee for the Supreme Court. And despite Trump’s history of racism, misogyny, and sexually forcing himself on women, McConnell has not criticized Trump. Nor has McConnell rebuked Trump for his specious attacks on diplomats and other government employees. “Civility” seems important to McConnell only when he feels he or one of his allies is the target of criticism.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com A man who sold ammunition to the Las Vegas massacre gunman pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Nevada to federal charges related to an illegal ammunition business he operated out of his Arizona home. LAS VEGAS MASSACRE DEATH TOLL RISES AFTER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WOMAN'S DEATH Douglas Haig, 57, was not accused of a direct role in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that killed 58 and injured more than 850 at an open-air music festival. Prosecutors never suggested that he had advance knowledge of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Haig acknowledged before U.S. District Judge James Mahan that he had no license to disassemble, remanufacture and reload bullets at his home workshop in Mesa, Ariz. According to investigators, Haig operated an illegal business called Specialized Military Ammunition from July 2016 to Oct. 2017, selling ammunition both online and at gun shows in several states, including Arizona and Nevada, Mercury News reported. Douglas Haig leaves the Lloyd George Federal Courthouse, Tuesday Nov. 19, 2019, in Las Vegas, after pleading guilty to illegally manufacturing tracer and armor-piercing bullets found in a high-rise hotel suite where a gunman took aim before the Las Vegas Strip massacre two years ago. (Elizabeth Page Brumley/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP) Law enforcement first began to investigate Haig after discovering unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds in gunman Stephen Paddock’s hotel room, the Mercury News reported. Haig’s fingerprints, as well as tool marks from his workshop, were found on two of the rounds, and his address was on a box that police found near Paddock’s body, court documents said. “Doug had no indication whatsoever about Stephen Paddock’s plans,” defense attorney Marc Victor said during a prepared statement outside U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Haig acknowledged publicly in 2018 that he sold 720 rounds of tracer ammunition to Paddock in the weeks before the massacre after the two met at a gun show. Tracers illuminate the path of fired bullets, allowing shooters a more precise hit. Haig closed the business permanently following an FBI raid less than three weeks after the shooting, according to his defense attorney. His plea agreement allowed him to avoid a trial that had been scheduled to begin next month. Haig could have faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His deal could get him about two years at sentencing Feb. 19. Victor said he’ll seek probation. CLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM The Las Vegas police department’s initial assessment of the shooting reported that 58 people were killed and 869 people were injured, including 413 who were wounded by bullets or shrapnel, the New York Times reported. Haig’s plea comes after a southern California woman, who was left paralyzed after she was shot in the back during the shooting, died last week. A coroner’s report has yet to be released. If it’s determined she died as a result of the injuries she suffered during the shooting, the death toll will rise to 59. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

WHITE, ALEXANDER NIEVES and GRAPH MASSARA 11/18/2019 09:19 AM EST Presented by Local Solar for All THE BUZZ — KAMALA’S DILEMMA: Kamala Harris came into this weekend’s California Democratic convention under pressure from several fronts: her lagging polls, her tepid fundraising and the latest headlines about her campaign disarray, via POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago. And before a gaggle of reporters, California’s junior U.S. senator delivered a defiant message Saturday as news emerged that polls show Pete Buttigieg with a commanding double digit lead in Iowa — a state where she is “all in,’’ and betting the farm. “I am very supportive of my campaign, of the people who are working it,’’ she told reporters at the California state Democratic convention. “They've done great work which has gotten us to the point where we are today,” she continued, adding that she’s focused on “the real issues,” like impeachment, immigration and the 2020 census. “That’s where my head is focused.” THE BIG QUESTION: Despite the senator’s pumped-up demeanor — bolstered by a new endorsement from the United Farmworkers union — much of the buzz this weekend among the activist California delegates and guests gathered in Long Beach to hear from eight presidential candidates centered on the political future of Harris, and whether it may be time for her to withdraw rather than face humiliation in her home state. The story by POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci. ENDORSEMENTS: On a relatively conflict-free weekend, there was some drama over Dem-on-Dem endorsement fights. In SD-7, leftward Democratic challenger Marisol Rubio blocked Democrat and recurring labor target Sen. Steve Glazer from winning the party endorsement; in SD-37, neither UC Irvine law professor Dave Min nor Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley won the nod to take on GOP state Sen. John Moorlach (though Min got more votes); San Diego City Councilwoman Georgette Gómez won the party’s nod to seek the CA-53 seat Rep. Susan Davis is relinquishing; and in CA-22, Bobby Bliatout is the party’s choice to take on GOP Rep. Devin Nunes. DEVAL’S INTRO: California Democrats got an early look at new presidential entrant Deval Patrick. The former Massachusetts governor didn’t get booed, but we didn’t hear many cheers either. He eschewed policy specifics for a message of unity, saying he was not running to be “president of the Democrats,” although he said “this is no time for a moderate agenda.” As POLITICO’s David Siders notes, the tepid response counts as a win. GAVIN’S TAKE: Gov. Gavin Newsom dropped by the PJ Hackenflak Dinner, a semi-traditional convention press dinner, this time organized by hometown reporter Seema Mehta of the LATimes. (See SPOTTED below.) In between being mobbed by guests for selfies, Newsom weighed in on some headlines. Among them: — On Kamala Harris’ poll numbers: “I’ll say this, polls don’t vote, people vote. And the only poll that matters is election day.” (Yes, he said it.) — On whether California will matter in 2020: “Yeah, we matter. We’re still a bit of an ATM machine, and this thing you see is wide open. ... [That] suggests the old rules may not apply — and it means California may surprise a lot of people.” — On why he didn’t formally address the Dem convention this weekend: Newsom headed Saturday to his in-laws’ 50th wedding anniversary, where he said he would “be spending time in a mini Republican convention. … And yes, we will be talking about impeachment.” SCHIFF SHAPE: Impeachment jockey Rep. Adam Schiff got a hero’s welcome, drawing multiple standing ovations, and galvanized the crowd by noting how sweeping 2018 wins opened the door to “accountability” (i.e. impeachment): “You did that when you delivered the House of Representatives to the Democrats instead of that cult of personality now masquerading as the Republican Party.” He predicted Dems will “send that charlatan Trump... back to the golden throne he came from.” KATIE’S COMEBACK? Former Rep. Katie Hill was the surprise guest at the Democratic Women’s Caucus meeting, and the former CA-25 representative seemed overwhelmed by the reception — a wild, cheering standing ovation from hundreds in the room. The moment, captured on Twitter, became the source of major trolling on social media by critics who said Dems were lionizing a woman who had abused her office by having an affair with a campaign staffer. Supporters insist Hill had been the victim of a double standard, and wouldn’t have had to resign if she had been a man. LABOR OF LOATHE: Rising tensions between organized labor and Gov. Gavin Newsom were on display. The building trades handed out a glossy pamphlet slamming Newsom for vetoing priority bills and set up a blue slushy booth to warn Democrats against forsaking their working base in handling the gig economy and a green transition. Union leader Robbie Hunter delivered a tough message that “Trump won because blue collar workers did not believe the Democratic party was speaking to their issues” — and warned that danger exists again in 2020. AND THIS HAPPENED: “3 men arrested after fight outside California Democratic Party convention in Long Beach,” by the Long Beach Press-Telegram’s Nathaniel Percy. BUENOS DIAS, good Monday morning. We’ve got some fresh California polling coming later today that could offer some more context for this weekend’s Democratic candidate clusterfest. Stay tuned! — QUOTES OF THE CONVENTION: “How much money do you have?” Univision’s Jorge Ramos’ first question to mega-donor Tom Steyer during a presidential forum. (Steyer: “less every day”). ... “My pronouns are she, her, hers — and badass.” State Sen. Holly Mitchell. ... “Zuckerberg, you are not going to have a platform on Facebook so that politicians can say anything they want to .... Women are going to stop you!” Rep. Maxine Waters to at the Women’s Caucus. — TWEET OF THE DAY: @GavinNewsom goes after Toyota: “You can try to disguise the decision you made — but it won’t change the facts. You chose to go the way of Donald Trump and the oil industry over clean air and our kids’ future. There is no denying that.” — WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced. MORE SHOOTINGS — “5 dead, including 3 children, in Paradise Hills shooting,” by the SD-UT’S John Wilkens, Kristina Davis: “Five members of a family, including three children, died in a shooting at a Paradise Hills home Saturday morning and another child was wounded and undergoing surgery, San Diego police said.” — “4 dead, 6 wounded in mass shooting in southeast Fresno home. No arrests, police say,” by FresnoBee’s BY Joshua Tehee, Brianna Calix and Larry Valenzuela: “At least four men were killed and six others were wounded Sunday night in southeast Fresno when gunmen sneaked into a backyard party and opened fire on dozens of people watching football. It was the third mass shooting in California in less than a week.” — “Asylum officers rebel against Trump policies they say are immoral and illegal,” by the LA Times’ Molly O’Toole: “It only took Doug Stephens two days to decide: He wasn’t going to implement President Trump’s latest policy to restrict immigration, known as Remain in Mexico. The asylum officer wouldn’t interview any more asylum seekers only to send them back to danger in Mexico.” — “Trump administration ousts top homelessness official as White House prepares broad crackdown,” by WaPo’s Jeff Stein. — DETENTE? “'We're very close': Pelosi and Mnuchin meet to break border wall impasse,” by POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris: “Officials from both parties emerged from the meeting confident that they could settle on concrete spending amounts over the weekend — a deal that would likely avoid a paralyzing government-wide shutdown this winter.” — SPEIER VS. SOLOMON: “Jackie Speier erupts at reporter for The Hill,” by POLITICO’s Michael Calderone: “Angered by the testimony of ousted ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, California Rep. Jackie Speier upbraided a reporter for The Hill and ripped the outlet’s publication of columns by John Solomon, the conservative journalist whose work is at the center of what Yovanovitch described as a ‘smear campaign’ against her.” — UFW FOR KAMALA: The United Farmworkers union threw its weight behind Sen. Harris this weekend, praising her “fight for equal treatment and protection of farm workers” and her “bold leadership on immigrant rights.” Longtime farmworker champion and UFW official Dolores Huerta endorsed Harris months ago. — TOM RAMPS IT UP: Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign announced the hiring of Katie Vavao as the campaign’s California state director. She previously worked with the California Democratic Party, the Assembly, and most recently at the Democratic Office of Communications and Outreach. Between senior staff and organizers, Steyer’s California staff is now nearing 30 people. — PARA BERNIE: “Bernie Sanders holds rally in East L.A. as part of his outreach to young Latinos,” by the LA Times’ Melissa Gomez: “Young Latinos...were strong supporters of Sanders in 2016, and the candidate is reaching out to them again in hopes they can help him capture primaries nationwide, and particularly California’s March 3 Democratic contest.” — “How a Bloomberg presidential bid could upend California’s primary,” by McClatchy’s Emily Cadei and the Sac Bee’s Bryan Anderson: “[T]he one-time Republican turned anti-Trump activist reportedly sees a path to the Democratic nomination through Super Tuesday, focusing on delegate-rich states like California, where his personal wealth could make him a factor.” — CALLING IT: Gov. Gavin Newsom set special election primaries for a pair of open seats — the CA-25 seat formerly held by Katie Hill and the SD-28 post relinquished by Jeff Stone — for March 3, the same day as the primary.

274,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/watch-abc-news-democratic-presidential-debate/story?id=65389730&cid=social_twitter_abcn,"Ten candidates will take the stage in Houston, Texas at 8 p.m. Thursday. ABC News Live The third Democratic debate, hosted on Thursday by ABC News and Univision, will feature a single night of debate between the top 10 highest polling candidates -- the smallest roster yet in the third matchup of Democratic National Committee-sanctioned primary debates, with a field that still counts 20. The 10 candidates, certified by the Democratic National Committee to participate in the debate, will appear on stage in the following order, from left to right: In the two prior debates in Miami and Detroit earlier this summer, the current two polling front-runners never tangled on the same stage. But on Thursday, Biden and Warren are set to clash for the first time -- putting the ideological divide within the Democratic Party front and center. Biden will be sandwiched between both progressive stalwarts Warren and Sanders, who have avoided criticizing each other so far this cycle, and who even teamed up to champion their shared vision for transformative progressive reform during the July debate. In the lead-up to the debate, Biden has been faced with questions over his many gaffes -- most recently, calling the president ""Donald Hump"" during a speech before the New Hampshire Democratic Party state convention. He chalked it up to a ""Freudian slip"" and when pressed on his mistakes during an appearance on the ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" he said, ""Any gaffe that I have made, and I've made gaffes, like every politician I know has, has been not about the substance of issue, but about other -- I'm trying to talk about what other people have done.” Warren, amid a summer surge that puts her in the top three in recent polls, is expecting a new round of criticism from the other contenders. ""I think it’s because I get out and talk about what's broken, and have real plans to fix it. And I'm building a grassroots movement to get it done,” she said of her rise, before telling ABC News over the weekend her approach for this debate hasn't changed. Biden, with a target on his back, is expected to have to fend off attacks from all sides with Harris, Booker, Buttigieg and Yang all armed with fresh ammunition. Klobuchar is another middle-of-the-road candidate who might take aim at a progressive agenda that touts Medicare for All and free public college tuition. Castro and O'Rourke, both appearing in their home state, are also on the same stage again, potentially teeing up another wrangle between the two Texans over immigration. More recently, however, O'Rourke has turned his focus to another issue: gun reform. He's spent the past few weeks traveling to states outside of the first month of the primary calendar -- focusing on a message of commonsense gun control, from background checks to mandatory buybacks of assault-style weapons, in the wake of a mass shooting in his native El Paso that killed 22 people. The debate format will be one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses to questions and 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals. Candidates will have the opportunity to deliver opening statements, but there will be no closing statements. As previously announced, ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos, ABC News ""World News Tonight"" Anchor and Managing Editor David Muir, ABC News Correspondent Linsey Davis and Univision Anchor Jorge Ramos will moderate. The debate will be held at Texas Southern University, a public, historically black university, and will air from 8 to 11 p.m. ET across ABC, on Univision with a Spanish translation, locally on KTRK-TV and on ABC News Live. The streaming channel is available on the ABCNews.com, Good Morning America and FiveThirtyEight websites and mobile phone apps, as well as on Hulu Live, The Roku Channel, Facebook Watch, AppleTV, Amazon Fire TV, YouTube, Apple News, and Twitter.

News By Aaron Feis Submit November 20, 2019 | 1:58am Getty Images Getty Images Getty Images View Slideshow Ten Democratic White House hopefuls will once again take the debate stage on Wednesday night, vying to make an impression on a national television audience as polling and fundraising restrictions continue to narrow the field. Here’s what you need to know before the candidates square off in the fifth round of Democratic debates. How to Watch The debate kicks off at 9 p.m. EST, and will air on MSNBC and stream on washingtonpost.com. The two outlets are co-sponsoring the debate, which is expected to run until 11 p.m. The debate will be held at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The Peach State and its 16 electoral votes went for President Trump in 2016 by a 5.1-percent margin, and it’s expected to be a key battleground state in 2020. The Lineup Progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will look to maintain momentum as she duels former Vice President Joe Biden, who was long considered the frontrunner but has hit a polling wall in recent months. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will look to try to pull out of what’s become a comfortable third place, while South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg hopes to continue setting himself apart as a youthful, yet moderate voice among the field. The field is rounded out by California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer. Two participants in October’s debate will be missing in former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. The former has ended his flagging campaign, while the latter is trudging forward, but failed to meet the polling and fundraising requirements. The highest-polling candidates will take center-stage. From left to right, the order will be: Booker, Gabbard, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders, Harris, Yang and Steyer. How the Candidates Qualified Each of the candidates had to tally donations from at least 165,000 unique donors, plus reach a certain threshold in a number of approved national or early-state polls: three percent in four polls, or five percent in two polls. Who Will Moderate A panel of four moderators will try to keep order among the field: MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Andrew Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker.

277,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/el-paso-shooting-survivors.html,"WALMART SHOOTING Credit... Supported by By Manny Fernandez and Tamir Kalifa Photographs by Tamir Kalifa EL PASO — Luis Calvillo has an angel on his shoulder. The tattoo covers his left arm, the archangel Michael wielding a sword over howling demons. But Mr. Calvillo, 33, believes it was an angel he could not see who kept him alive that day in August. It was a Saturday morning outside a Walmart in El Paso, and the soccer team he leads was selling snacks to raise money for an out-of-state tournament. One moment he was chatting with a fellow coach; the next, a man was spraying the outside of the store with gunfire, and Mr. Calvillo was on the ground, blood pouring from his leg. Several soccer parents were also shot. His father, Jorge Calvillo García, was killed. “I never thought about anyone else,” Mr. Calvillo said. “I was just thinking that it was going to be the last time that I was going to breathe. The last time.” Only later did he have another thought: “My dad’s soul stayed there to protect me,” he said. Mass shooting stories are usually told at funerals and candlelight vigils, cataloged by the number of dead left to bury when the gunfire stops. Surviving is a much longer story, often left unrecorded. There are the first chaotic minutes and hours in the paramedics’ van and the operating room. And there are the days and weeks of uncertain recovery that follow, the slow-motion coda of mass violence that unfolds painfully and privately. It took Mr. Calvillo nearly six weeks to be able to get a haircut, seven weeks to move without a walker for the first time. The gunfire that day left 22 people dead and two dozen injured. The white gunman wrote that his attack was a response to “the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” a hateful motive Mr. Calvillo has struggled to understand, having survived combat as an American soldier with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division in Iraq. “We didn’t deserve this,” he said. “We’re good people. We’re not bad people. And this dude just came to ruin everything.” The soccer team — the El Paso Fusion, for girls ages 9 to 12 — and its supporters were spread out that day between the store’s main entrance and exit doors, facing the parking lot. Mr. Calvillo, an operations manager for a trucking company who founded the Fusion and served as its head coach, was standing near the team’s canopy, talking to his friend and fellow coach, Guillermo Garcia. Mr. Calvillo’s wife and 10-year-old daughter were nearby. His father had just pulled up. He felt the first bullet before he heard it: “I turned around to find out what was happening and I see him coming toward us, shooting at us.” Mr. Calvillo knew he was losing blood fast. His Army training kicked in: He stopped talking, to preserve energy, and he went into survival mode. Seven of the people shot on Aug. 3 were part of the Fusion family. Two coaches — Mr. Calvillo and Mr. Garcia — and four parents were wounded, and Mr. Calvillo’s father was killed. The 10 players who were there managed to escape the gunfire but were affected in unseen ways. One day at school not long ago, a door slammed and Mr. Calvillo’s daughter, Emylee, started running. “What did he gain?” Mr. Calvillo said of the gunman. “Nothing. What did we gain? Just pain, that’s all.” As the hours of recovery have stretched into weeks and then months, he has looked for a way through. The ink on his arm — a tattoo he got years ago, this one on his left wrist — once again seemed to offer a message. Looked at one way, it reads Pain. Looked at another way, it says something else. Love. Day 35 Mr. Calvillo was shot five times with an AK-47-style rifle — twice in his left leg, and three times on the side of his back. But as he lay on his bed at the University Medical Center of El Paso in early September, nearly five weeks after the shooting, it was his left foot that was causing him the most anguish. Sometimes his wife, Marcela Martinez, 38, massaged his foot. But other times he grimaced, and asked her not to touch it.  “You’re here 24 hours with nothing to do other than to wait for those pills or wait for that pain to come.” Mr. Calvillo’s wife, Marcela Martinez, tried to comfort him as he experienced painful side effects from new medication. None of the bullets hit major organs or arteries. But the nerves in his left leg were still reverberating from the trauma and sending shock waves through his foot. And there was everything else — breathing exercises for his lungs, roughly 30 pills to take a day, an infection that set back his rehabilitation, a bald patch. When he first arrived at the hospital, he was unconscious for days in the intensive-care unit, and the hair where the back of his head rested on the pillow still had not grown back. Mr. Calvillo could get in and out of bed. He had recently showered for the first time (“I was almost crying,” he said). But he was still counting the number of steps he could take — slowly, clutching a walker — without giving in to the pain. “The first week when they got me up, I did 180 steps,” he said. The next time, he pushed himself. He did about 300. Day 38 After the 48 staples stitching him together were removed, Mr. Calvillo’s wife, Ms. Martinez, decided to keep them. It was his pain. But it was hers, too. After Aug. 3, Ms. Martinez stopped working as a teacher to be with her husband full time. One day in early September, she spent a rare morning at home and took Emylee, a fifth-grader, to school. When Ms. Martinez was by herself, she suddenly felt it was time. She was ready to visit what nearly everyone in El Paso had seen: the memorial outside the Walmart. She pulled into the parking lot and walked over, her eyes filling with tears. There were thousands of candles, crosses, teddy bears, flowers and American and Mexican flags along a chain-link fence, the trinkets of a border city’s binational heartache. She and her husband were born in El Paso but raised by their families in the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez; they embraced both cultures, both languages. [Our Houston Bureau Chief and a photographer spent nearly three months with Luis Calvillo and his family. Read more.] Until then, Ms. Martinez had been unable to get this close to a big-box store. When Emylee had needed a pair of jeans, Ms. Martinez had driven to Target but could not bring herself to get out of the car. She sat in the parking lot, and then drove away. The jeans would have to wait until later. She had no idea when. “I don’t think people understand that lives change, and not for good, after all this,” she said.  Ms. Martinez and the relatives of other victims hiked up Mount Cristo Rey in nearby New Mexico to lay crosses at the top of the mountain. The crosses honored the 22 victims of the shooting. Ms. Martinez has been juggling her own grief, supporting Mr. Calvillo through his recovery and taking care of their daughter, Emylee. At home, she helped Emylee get ready for school. She is equal parts soccer mom ... grieving daughter-in-law ... and survivor’s wife. Day 43 His foot was bothering him again. But he ignored it. “You got elected to student council?” he asked Emylee. It was mid-September, several weeks after the start of school, and his daughter was visiting him at Kindred Hospital, where he had been transferred for wound-care treatment. They talked as he sat in a wheelchair, pumping an arm bike. “Yes, but I didn’t want to do it,” Emylee said. “If you have the opportunity, do it,” he told her. “I know you can do it.” Regaining the use of his leg was one thing; being a hospital-bound father and coach was another challenge entirely. With the onset of the school year, he had started a new team for older girls and was constantly texting with Fusion parents, keeping his phone on the bed beside him or on his chest.  There was a secret to Mr. Calvillo’s recuperation: He insisted on being a father in a hospital gown, a coach from his sick bed. Being shot five times often seemed more an inconvenience than a trauma. He even shut out his grief ... for now. Getting out of the hospital was about recovering, but it was about grief, too. His father had been cremated but his mother postponed the funeral, wanting her son to be there. Emylee came up to him, smiling big. “You know what I dreamed?” she asked. In her dream, she was wearing a blue dress that sparkled at the quinceañera that would happen on her 15th birthday. And her grandfather was there, too. “Your grandpa is going to visit you a lot in your dreams,” he told her. “He didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.” Day 49 The sound of a referee’s whistle filled Room 1001. The shrill noise was coming out of Mr. Calvillo’s phone. The girls had a game. His wife was on the sideline, live-streaming the action as he watched from the hospital. “If they push you, push them back,” a Fusion girl told another player. “Hey!” Mr. Calvillo shouted. That was not the way they played ball. The Fusion ended up losing. The nurses came in periodically to take his temperature and blood pressure, but his eyes stayed riveted on the phone. “There are so many things that I had already worked on that they’re not doing, and it frustrates me,” he said. Soccer, once a weekend pastime, had transformed into a devotion that was as closely tied to his rehabilitation as the arm bike down the hall. It had happened before. After serving in Iraq, Mr. Calvillo had started experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. It became so severe he had suicidal thoughts. But the Fusion had helped pull him out of it. Now he was relying on them again, just as they were counting on him, coaching from his hospital bed. “When I started the team, I found a lot of comfort,” he said. “So that’s why I take so much pride and I take it too serious. Because that’s my getaway.” Day 56 He held his wife’s hand as she drove him home. It was Sept. 27. He had spent nearly two months in two hospitals, undergone five operations and lost about 40 pounds. He did not stay home for long. He had something to do. Hours after he was released from the hospital, he was sitting in his wheelchair on the grass at a Fusion game. “Talk to each other, ladies!” Mr. Calvillo yelled into a megaphone.  Coach Luis was back. “I’ve been out of the hospital for less than five hours,” he said. “And I’m here. And I’m here for you guys because I care about you guys and I care about everyone that is here, all these families, all right?” The Fusion failed to score a goal, but it did not matter. Mr. Calvillo leaned on his cane and called the girls to him. Bring it in, he told them. It was time for one last chant.“Family on three!” Mr. Garcia, the other Fusion coach who was wounded, remained in a hospital, but his wife, Jessica Garcia, was at the game, cheering their daughter, Karina. The field and sidelines were crowded with men, women and children who had fled or were struck by gunfire only a few weeks before. But that went largely unspoken. The gunman had forever changed their lives, but he would have no place on this green field at dusk. Day 78 Mr. Calvillo sat in the front pew of St. Mark Catholic Church, staring at the stone box holding his father’s urn. It was mid-October, more than two months since the shooting, but the passage of time did not make the funeral any easier. His father had been his lifelong mentor. Jorge Calvillo García, an accountant and business executive, had been born in Mexico but lived in El Paso with his wife, Eva Calvillo, 61. They would have celebrated their 38th anniversary in December, but their children and grandchildren had been the real center of their lives. Ms. Martinez recalled a day years ago when she was pregnant with Emylee and there was an unexpected knock on her door. “I open the door, and it was both of them, Eva and Jorge, with everything you can think a baby can need — the car seats, stroller, the crib,” she said. “They bought everything for us.” At the church that day, Mr. Calvillo was very much a grieving son — he wore the St. Jude chain his father had been wearing when he was killed — but for the family gathered there, his mere presence in the pews was a kind of miracle. After the Mass, the hugs he received from the long line of relatives and friends had some sadness in them, but a touch of welcome home, too. One life lost. One life broken, but found. “I just think I got a second chance at life,” Mr. Calvillo said. “I can’t change things. I got to just keep on going.” Day 88 Mr. Calvillo keeps the wheelchair and walker in the garage. He walks on his own now. At home in late October, nearly three months after the attack, he revved up his new toy: a three-wheeled motorcycle. Ms. Martinez was preparing to return to her fourth-grade class in December. She fought her fear and took Emylee to Target to buy supplies for a science project. “Our lives are going to be before and after — before Walmart and after Walmart,” Ms. Martinez said. Mr. Calvillo went back to work at the trucking company. One of the first things he did after getting out of the hospital was buy a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson. “It’s just for protection,” he said. “I’m not going to experience the same thing again.” As he ate a late dinner with his wife and daughter, Mr. Calvillo hardly looked at his new tattoo. It was on his right arm, opposite the angels and demons. It read El Paso Strong. In the center was the Fusion.

279,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-transgender-day-of-remembrance-so-much-loss-so-much-to-keep-fighting-for?source=articles&via=rss,"SEARCH The Transgender Day of Remembrance honors transgender people who have been murdered and killed. Today, we should remember them, and vow to keep fighting for justice and equality. Today, November 20, the Transgender Day of Remembrance—when the transgender victims of murder are remembered—is solemn, sad, and also focusing. In the seven months since President Trump’s ban on trans troops went into effect, the impact of discrimination has been felt not just by service members but by their families, too. In the 10 months since New York State lawmakers passed and Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law barring anti-transgender discrimination, the Movement Advancement Project has found that trans Americans living in more rural areas face significantly greater challenges, including harassment, violence and even murder, especially for trans people of color. Transgender people are the new bogeyman, the hunted, the hated, and, more and more, the targeted. Worldwide, there has been a total of 331 cases of reported killings of trans and gender-diverse people between Oct. 1, 2018, and Sept. 30, 2019, according to Trans Respect Versus Transphobia. If anyone needed a sign that the murders of transgender people here in the U.S. and around the world had reached epidemic stage, you didn’t need declarations from the Human Rights Campaign or the American Medical Association. I could feel the heat of it, on my face, as I lit one of the hundreds of candles at a Transgender Day of Remembrance ceremony at Metropolitan Community Church of Hartford, Connecticut. All of us in attendance lit one candle for each name on a list that included more than two dozen Americans and so many more trans people from around the world, the majority of whom lived and died in Brazil. There were so many names, most of us returned to the altar two, even three times to light candles in memory of those we lost. The Transgender Day of Remembrance, or TDoR as it’s often called, was created by journalist Gwen Smith. As I pondered what this day means to me, six and a half years since I came out as transgender, I asked its founder for her thoughts on this year’s observance. “This year marks the 20th year of the Transgender Day of Remembrance as an annual event,” Smith told me in a Twitter DM, our usual method of communicating. She is a wonderful sounding board, unpaid copy editor and friend, often far too shy about her invaluable contributions to both journalism, and our community. “It is astonishing, humbling to see the event continue, but maddening to live in a world where we must continue to face so many killed each year at the hand of anti-transgender violence. Rather than seeing the numbers decline, we're seeing the number of deaths increase in a time when transgender people are being routinely scapegoated, treated as predators or worse.” Smith maintains a list at tdor.info, and recommends the Trans Murder Monitoring project. HRC and The Advocate also keep a record, each of which conflicts with the other over how many murders in the U.S. are reported. Why are trans people, most of them trans women of color, targeted? Some argue because of sex work, or the areas in which they lived. Economic hardship is part of the transgender experience, from homelessness to housing discrimination, from workplace harassment and unemployment to sex work, according to the National Transgender Survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality. Hate crimes against transgender and non-conforming individuals are up: There were at least 142 incidents of anti-trans violence with 160 victims, reported to the FBI in 2018 (the latest year available). That’s up from 106 incidents and 119 victims from the prior year. For gender non-conforming individuals, the number of hate crimes doubled from 13 to 26. And those are just the ones that were reported; the actual number is no doubt far higher. Hate, in general, is up, if you just look at the timeline of any trans woman on Twitter, including my own. And I benefit from my white privilege, so my personal hater index is far smaller than for other, more well-known journalists and advocates, especially those who are women of color. These stories are harder to tell, admittedly. And while I’m the last one to seek sympathy for how I earn my living, it’s not made easier by police or media who consider legal identification records like driver licenses to be the last word on someone’s name or gender. There are also the feelings of grieving relatives that must be considered, some of whom choose to remember their loved ones as they saw them, not as they lived, or died. Misgendering is all too common. Finally, there are the reports that take time to determine, such as the March 25th death by natural causes of 34-year-old Jazzaline Ware, and the suspicious death of Elisha Chanel Stanley of Pittsburgh, who died on Sept. 16. While many considered Stanley’s death the result of foul play, the medical examiner determined her death to be an accidental drug overdose. Here are the stories of some of the other names Smith, The Advocate and HRC included this year of the 23 transgender and gender non-conforming people in the United States who were murdered from October 2018 through October 2019: ""Tydi Dansbury"" Tydi Dansbury 37, was a black transgender woman, found shot on a street in Baltimore, Maryland, on Nov. 26, 2018.  Kelly Stough, aka Keanna Mattel, 36, was a black transgender woman shot on Dec. 7, 2018, during a “tussle” with a Detroit pastor and part-time security guard, Albert Weathers, 46. The Detroit News reported that he was to be tried for murder.  Dana Martin, 31, was a black transgender woman, apparently shot while she was driving in Montgomery, Alabama, on Jan. 6. “She was a person that was loved by many,” recalled Alabama trans activist Daroneshia Duncan-Boyd to Into. Ashanti Carmon, 27, of Alexandria, Va., was a black transgender woman found shot to death March 31 on a street in Fairmount Heights, Maryland, just across the state line from Washington, D.C. Her fiancé, Philip Williams, described their six-year relationship as “the most brilliant thing I’ve ever done in my life.” Claire Legato, 21, a black transgender woman, was fatally shot during an argument over a tax refund check, between her mother and an armed man named James Booth in her mother's Cleveland, Ohio, backyard on April 15. Friends and family remember her as someone who was “full of life.” No word on charges facing Booth since Legato’s death in May. Muhlaysia Booker, 23, a black transgender woman, was fatally shot in Dallas, Texas, on May 18, one month after she was beaten by a mob at an apartment complex. ABC News reported that Kendrell Lavar Lyles, 33, was charged with Booker's murder. Police are looking into whether her killing is related to the shooting death of another Dallas trans woman last October and the stabbing of yet another in April. “Such a beautiful spirit taken too soon,” said a friend of Booker. “She lived her life and loved all of who she was.” Michelle ‘Tamika’ Washington, 40, a black transgender woman, was fatally shot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 19. Washington, who was also known by the names Tameka and Michelle Simone, had studied nursing at the Community College of Philadelphia. The day after her death, police arrested Troy Bailey, 28, for her murder. Paris Cameron, 20, a black transgender woman, was among three people killed in a horrific anti-LGBTQ shooting in a home in Detroit, Mich., on May 25, according to Detroit Free Press. The crime was motivated by the victims' identity, Wayne County prosecutors said. Devon Robinson, 19, was arrested June 5 and has been charged with three counts of first-degree murder, two counts of assault with intent to murder, and five counts of the use of a firearm in connection with a felony. Chynal Lindsey, 26, a black transgender woman, was found dead in White Rock Lake, Dallas, Texas, with signs of “homicidal violence” on the first day of Pride month, June 1, according to police. Those who knew Lindsey described her as “smiling” and “a person I had never seen mad.” The body of Chanel Scurlock, 23, a black transgender woman, was found fatally shot in a field in Lumberton, North Carolina, on June 6. The Robeson County Sheriff’s Office arrested Javaras Hammonds, 20, of Lumberton, June 12, reported the News&Observer. He is charged with first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon. Zoe Spears, 23, a black transgender woman, was found shot to death in Fairmount Heights, Maryland, on June 13, just blocks from where her friend, Ashanti Carmon, had been murdered, reported Fox 45 News. Spears worked in retail and had ambitions to become a lawyer. Trans advocate Ruby Corado, the founder and executive director of Casa Ruby, told HRC that Spears was “very bright and very full of life.” Trans activist Earline Budd described Spears as a “vibrant young person.” Brooklyn Lindsey, 32, a black transgender woman, was found dead in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 25, reported Fox 4, Kansas City. Neighbors said they heard an argument and gunshots at her house a few hours before Lindsey's body was found. In July, police arrested Marcus Lewis, 41. He has been charged with second-degree murder among other charges.  Denali Berries Stuckey, 29, a black transgender woman, was found fatally shot in North Charleston, South Carolina, on July 20. She was a Charleston native and worked as a manicurist. Dominick Archield, 34, turned himself in to police Aug. 11 and faces murder charges.  Tracy Single, 22, a black transgender woman, was killed in Houston, Texas, on July 30 and left for dead in a gas station parking lot. In her memory, Houston lit its City Hall in the pink, blue, and white colors of the trans Pride flag and illuminated bridges as well. Joshua Dominic Bourgeois, 25, is charged with Single's murder. Police said the two had been dating. She was also known as Tracy Williams. Bubba Walker, 55, a black transgender woman, was killed in Charlotte, North Carolina, sometime in July in a house fire being investigated as a homicide. Bubba’s remains were found Sept. 10. Walker’s friend, Clarabelle Catlin, said Bubba was homeless at the time of her death. “She was a kind soul, She was always smiling and was a people person. She lit up everywhere she went and everyone loved her.” Kiki Fantroy, 21, a black transgender woman, was fatally shot during an argument in Miami, FL, on July 31. Although police would not classify her murder as related to her transgender identity, Fantroy’s mother, Rhonda Comer, told the Miami Herald, “My understanding was she was killed because of her desire to be a woman.” Comer remembered her as having “a heart of gold” and being “a very loving person.” Jordan Cofer, 22, was a white transgender man and the first of nine victims killed in a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 4. The gunman was Cofer’s brother, and was killed in a shootout with police. “Jordan was probably one of the sweetest people you would ever meet, a true saint,” a friend told Splinter News. “But he was also very scared constantly.”  Pebbles LaDime “Dime” Doe, 24, a black transgender woman, was found murdered in a car in Allendale County, South Carolina, also on Aug. 4. Doe’s friends and family remembered her as having a “bright personality,” and being someone who “showed love” and who was “the best to be around.” Bailey Reeves, 17, a black transgender teen, was fatally shot in Baltimore, Maryland, on Sept. 2. Her brother Thomas told the Baltimore Sun she was “a person who lived her life to the fullest.” The body of Bee Love Slater, 23, a black transgender woman, was found burned beyond recognition in Clewiston, Florida, on Sept. 4, and identified two days later. Slater was remembered by her best friend Kenard Wade to WINK News as someone “with a really, really sweet heart” who “never harmed anyone.” Jamagio Jamar Berryman, 30, a black gender non-conforming individual, was killed in Kansas City, Kansas, on Sept. 13. Itali Marlowe, 29, a black transgender woman was found shot in her own car in Houston, Texas, on Sept. 20, and died at a hospital. Raymond Donald Williams, 23, was arrested and charged with Marlowe's murder in October. Brianna “BB” Hill, 30, a black transgender woman, was fatally shot in Kansas City, Missouri, on Oct. 14. She was also known as Breonna Be’Be Hill. Police say the alleged shooter remained at the scene until they arrived, and was arrested.

(Larry Valenzuela/The Fresno Bee via AP)  By TERENCE CHEA and OLGA R. RODRIGUEZ | The Associated Press FRESNO — A close-knit Hmong community was in shock after gunmen burst into a California backyard gathering and shot 10 men, killing four, including a popular singer who used to live in Long Beach. “We are right now just trying to figure out what to do, what are the next steps. How do we heal, how do we know what’s going on,” said Bobby Bliatout, a community leader. Sunday evening’s attack killed Xy Lee, a Hmong singer and musician ― and a former Long Beach resident — whose videos on YouTube have been viewed millions of times. Also killed were Phia Vang, 31; Kou Xiong, 38; and Kalaxang Thao, 40, all of Fresno, according to the coroner’s office. Three others remained hospitalized in serious condition, Community Regional Medical Center said in a statement. Police have not determined a motive and no suspects were identified. At a vigil Monday evening, relatives of Xiong set a table with photos, incense, and white candles outside the house. Xiong is survived by a wife and young daughter, according to a GoFundMe page. It describes him as “a humble, kind, and caring individual who was always willing to help those in need.” “Everybody is crying, our whole city is crying for these families,” said a sobbing Paula Yang, a friend of Xiong’s brother. Xiong’s uncle, Neej Xiong, prayed on his hands and knees. “It should’ve been me, not you,” Neej said. The Hmong are an ethnic group from Southeast Asia. Many fled after fighting alongside the United States during the Vietnam War. There are about 300,000 Hmong living in the U.S., according to the 2017 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. California has the nation’s largest Hmong population and about 25,000 live in Fresno, comprising about 5% of the city’s population of 525,000. The gunmen targeted a house where about 16 men had gathered outside to watch football on television, police said. Women and children had already moved inside. At least two men armed with semi-automatic handguns walked through a side gate and began firing randomly into the crowd before fleeing in the darkness, Police Chief Andrew Hall said. The shooters did not speak. Witnesses saw only flashes when the pistols were fired, Hall said. Police were investigating whether the shooting was connected to a recent disturbance involving some of the people at the party, Hall said. He did not describe the incident other than to say it occurred within the last week. Women and children inside the house weren’t hit, Hall said. The chief said at least 60 officers were investigating along with the FBI, Homeland Security and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. While police hadn’t found any gang connections to the victims, Hall also announced the establishment of an Asian gang task force over concerns about retaliation or more violence ahead of the Hmong New Year, which is celebrated next month. There have been 11 violent incidents related to Asian gangs in the city this year, three in November, police said. An Asian-American man was shot to death at a home earlier Sunday but police had not linked that killing to the party attack, Hall said. “This is truly a good group of people who were simply having a party,” the chief said. It was the third mass shooting in four days in California. Last Thursday, a 16-year-old boy armed with a handgun killed two students and wounded three others at his high school in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita before killing himself. On Saturday, a San Diego man killed his estranged wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son was on life-support. There have been eight mass killings in California so far this year, claiming the lives of 33 people, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. That’s a dramatic increase from previous years, with eight mass killings for all of 2016-2018. Rodriguez reported from San Francisco.

More than two years after hundreds of people were shot at a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip, another person has died from their injuries. Kimberly Gervais, who was paralyzed and suffered severe pain as a result of the attack, died on Friday, increasing the total number of victims who passed away to 59. Stephen Paddock was responsible for the shooting on Oct. 1, 2017, which was the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. [Los Angeles Times] If two people are both Rhodes Scholars, but only one gets the credit in the press, did they really achieve the same honor?

Entertainment By Ben Cost Submit November 20, 2019 | 1:27pm				| Updated November 20, 2019 | 3:42pm Send in the clown again. Less than two months after “Joker” debuted to critical acclaim (and controversy galore), a sequel to the flamboyant Batman baddie’s origin story is reportedly in the works. “Joker” director Todd Phillips supposedly requested the rights to a whole portfolio of DC origin films during an Oct. 7 meeting with Warner Bros. chairman Toby Emmerich, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And while Emmerich “balked” at the ambitious proposal, Phillips was given the green light for a “Joker” followup. However, Deadline is reporting that the meeting didn’t happen and that Phillips never had intentions to work on other characters’ origin stories. According to the Reporter, the clown prince’s cinematic second coming will see Phillips reunite with co-writer Scott Silver, and Warner Bros. has reportedly already tapped Joaquin Phoenix, 45, to play the Joker again. His impressive first turn as the Dark Knight’s nemesis has garnered the actor early nods for a Best Actor Oscar. Warner Bros Warner Bros Warner Bros. View Slideshow While potential plot details are non-existent, the film could continue to follow the blossoming snake-and-mongoose relationship between Arthur Fleck and a young Bruce Wayne. It won’t be a Batman origin story, however — that’s being tackled by Matt Reeve’s “The Batman,” set for June 25, 2021. Either way, the sequel undoubtedly aims to cash in on the success of the first flick, which raked in over $1 billion, making it the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Phillips, 48, will collect $100 million when all the hubbub dies down, according to the Reporter. As long as they don’t film again at a particular set of stairs in The Bronx.

285,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/briefing/gordon-sondland-debate-google.html,"Advertisement Supported by Here’s what you need to know at the end of the day. By Andrea Kannapell and Marcus Payadue (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Pivotal testimony in the impeachment hearings. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, one of the “three amigos” pursuing President Trump’s Ukraine policy, tied Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials to the pressure campaign on Ukraine. “Everyone,” he said, “was in the loop.” And he affirmed that there was a quid pro quo over shows of U.S. support. But Mr. Sondland also said that Mr. Trump “never told me directly” that military aid for Ukraine was conditioned on investigations into Democratic rivals, and that when he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine, Mr. Trump answered, “I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.” Mr. Trump has seized on the first part of his comment — made after the White House learned of the whistle-blower complaint — as exoneration. The hearings resume on Thursday at 9 a.m. Eastern, with Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official, and David Holmes, a Ukraine-based State Department official. 2. The fifth Democratic presidential debate is underway (if you didn’t already spend your TV allotment on the impeachment hearing). Democratic candidates grappled with the impact of the impeachment inquiry at the start of the debate; Bernie Sanders warned that Democrats should not be “consumed” by President Trump. We’re streaming the event with live analysis from our reporters. The top contenders, who own the center of the stage, are Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Sanders and a surging Pete Buttigieg. Watch for sharp elbows — especially as Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris try to break into the top tier. More than 1,000 readers wrote in about the issues they want the candidates to address. Climate led. And the stage will have more women than ever before, with four as candidates and four as moderators: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, NBC’s Kristen Welker and Ashley Parker of The Washington Post. 3. Israel’s political chaos entered a new phase. After Benny Gantz, the leader of the Blue and White party, said he was unable to form a government, above, the task fell for the first time to Parliament. Lawmakers now have 21 days to come up with a candidate — any candidate, including Mr. Gantz or his rival, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who could command a majority of seats in the 120-seat Parliament. And if that doesn’t work, Israel would have to face a third election — possibly just as divided as the first two — most likely in the spring.  4. China’s Communist government warned that it would use its authority to overrule Hong Kong’s judiciary. The warning struck at the heart of what has fueled months of unrest: concerns about Beijing’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s civil liberties and rule of law. Above, supporters escorted those charged with rioting from a court in Hong Kong under cover of umbrellas on Wednesday. “It represents a new stage in Hong Kong’s protest movement,” said a political analyst in Beijing. “It has reached the stage of a very direct conflict over sovereignty.” Separately, a Beijing gallery canceled a pending show by a prominent Chinese-American artist, Hung Liu, in the latest sign that hard-nosed authoritarianism is creeping into China’s civil society. 5. Google has hired a consulting firm known for its anti-union efforts — a move employees discovered by digging through entries in an internal calendar. The hiring of IRI Consultants is a surprising turn for one of Silicon Valley’s giants, which tend to be known for good pay and perks. But Google has been challenged by activist workers for nearly two years, including over the handling of sexual abuse accusations last year, above. And it has been taking steps to block internal dissent, employees say. And we tracked a gig worker revolt at Rev, a start-up offering online transcriptions, after the company slashed pay rates for contractors. “This felt good,” said the revolt’s leader. “It felt like I was finally saying, ‘I have been doing this and it has sucked a lot.’” 6. G.M. v. Fiat Chrysler. General Motors filed a racketeering lawsuit, accusing its rival Fiat Chrysler of bribing United Auto Workers officials during contract negotiations in 2011 and 2015. Above, Fiat’s headquarters in Turin, Italy. Fresh from a 40-day U.A.W. strike, G.M. did not sue the union. Fiat Chrysler, headquartered above in Turin, Italy, said it was “astonished” by the lawsuit, which it called “meritless,” and suggested the legal filing was meant to disrupt its proposed merger with the maker of Peugeot and Citroën cars. 7. One of our most-read stories today is a follow-up on the mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart that left 22 people dead and many others injured. That tally includes Luis Calvillo, who was shot five times in the parking lot as the girls’ soccer team he coaches was holding a fund-raiser. Mr. Calvillo, a veteran who served in Iraq with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division, insisted on coaching the team from his sick bed as he recuperated. He took us on his journey to recovery. “I just think I got a second chance at life,” Mr. Calvillo said. “I can’t change things. I got to just keep on going.” 8. Say goodbye to your plastic Hamburglar: Fast-food chains are attempting to scale back their distribution of free toys, a bid to address environmental concerns about single-use plastics. Burger King is melting down hundreds of thousands of toys, which will be turned into playground equipment and reusable table trays. Next year, McDonald’s will offer British children the choice between a toy or a book with their Happy Meals. Environmental experts say it’s not evident that these efforts would make a meaningful impact. Oxford Dictionaries has named “climate emergency” as its 2019 Word of the Year, choosing it from an all-environmental shortlist that also included “climate action,” “climate denial,” “eco-anxiety,” “extinction” and “flight shame.” 9. Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X dominated the list of Grammy nominations. That continues a growing trend: recognition for young, diverse artists reflective of the forefront of pop. The charismatic pop and R&B star Lizzo, above at the Hollywood Palladium in October, is up for eight awards, including the four major categories: album, record and song of the year, and best new artist. Among the major snubs and surprises: Taylor Swift received three nominations for her album “Lover,” but none in the major categories. The awards ceremony will be held on Jan. 26 in Los Angeles. 10. And finally, did you know … That the Pilgrims who came to the American continent starting in 1620 never called themselves that? They were separatists, according to James Loewen, a sociologist and the author of “Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong.” It was more than two centuries before “Pilgrims” began to be used to describe them.

AP PHOTO—AP THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Greta Thunberg, a young activist who has gone from staging school strikes to scolding world leaders about their climate change inaction, was awarded the prestigious International Children’s Peace Prize on Wednesday, along with Cameroon peace campaigner Divina Maloum. Maloum campaigns for the rights and education of Cameroon children preyed upon by extremist groups, while Thunberg has made global headlines for her calls for action to tackle climate change. Thunberg could not accept the award in person as she was sailing across the Atlantic Ocean toward an international climate conference in Madrid. She texted a friend and fellow activist Luisa Neubauer, who accepted the award on her behalf: “I am incredibly grateful and honored for this prize.” Thunberg dedicated the prize to her Fridays For Future movement. In a video introducing the winners, organizers said that Thunberg and Maloum show that “children are at the heart of the fight for a safe and sustainable future.” Maloum set up an organization called Children for Peace that tours schools, mosques and marketplaces in her native Cameroon speaking to children who could fall prey to extremist groups like Boko Haram. She draws pictures, including of a child refusing to wear a suicide bomb vest, as a way of cutting through linguistic barriers to bring across her message. She said that she would use her half of the 100,000 euro ($110,000) fund linked to the award to help fund her group’s next project, a pan-African children’s parliament. She called it “a platform which is going to help children to be implicated in peace-building processes and to make their voice be heard around the world.” Speaking to The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony, Maloum said she was honored to be receiving the prize alongside Thunberg. “She also is a bit like a model for me so I’m very, very happy,” she said. Previous winners of the annual prize include Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani schoolgirl who campaigned for girls’ right to education even after surviving being shot by Taliban militants, and the students behind the March For Our Lives in the aftermath of last year’s deadly mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.

289,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/609795712/0/phoenix/nation~Democratic-debate-in-Atlanta-From-A-to-F-Mastio-Lawrence-grade-the-candidates/,"David Mastio and Jill Lawrence grade Wednesday's Democratic debate in Atlanta: David: These debates are paying diminishing returns for the Democrats. Nobody really went out on a limb to make a big statement either in their attacks on Donald Trump or in their jockeying with each other. So what's the point? Tonight didn't really change anything other than to give me the sneaking suspicion that none of these candidates have the fire to take on the president. Jill: I am grateful that Medicare for All did not rear its head until the 18th minute of the debate, and it did not stick around long. I disagree with David (surprise) about the fire, though. I thought the candidates showed plenty of spunk, especially on Trump, impeachment and corruption. Now, on to the grades... David's grade: A. On his 77th birthday, the former vice president delivered his best performance yet. Yes, there were a few of those signature Biden moments. He apparently forgot that Kamala Harris exists, and he weirdly used ""punching"" to explain how he makes progress in fighting violence against women. But he’s right that Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin don’t want him to be president. Jill's grade: B+. Biden beat my expectations. It was reassuring to hear someone express familiar American values — like making the Saudis pariahs over the Khashoggi murder, and letting an independent Justice Department decide whether to prosecute former president Trump. And when Biden said we have to change a culture of violence against women by “punching at it and punching at it and punching at it,” that was not a sign of slipping with age. That was vintage Biden. David's grade: W. What is he waiting for? Like Bernie Sanders, Booker didn’t bring anything new to his argument, until that closing statement. That was inspiring, but was it enough? I don’t think so. Jill's grade: C+. The New Jersey senator hinted at ways he could define himself and stand out in this field when he said raising the minimum wage is fine but many people aspire to be entrepreneurs, that a wealth tax would be “cumbersome,” and that he started his career as a tax lawyer. But it never came together. David's grade: A. Nobody laid a glove on him. He solidified his position as an Iowa and New Hampshire polling leader. He handled doubts about his ability to reach out to black voters with an honest comparison of his experience as a gay man to that of African Americans without saying they were the same. Jill's grade: B+ The South Bend mayor defused one critique (on his inability to attract black voters) with grace and another (about his lack of experience) by touting his non-Washington resume and judgment. He also managed to strike one of the few optimistic notes of the evening, noting “extraordinary potential” in the American majorities ready to tackle issues like immigration and guns. David's grade: C. She’s the only one who really tried to go after Mayor Pete and stuck with it, so she may get some notice for that, but other than that she was flat despite putting her Hawaiian heritage on display. Jill's grade: D. The sooner she exits these debates, the better. She has some robotic party boilerplate down, but she's often in a blame-Democrats mode. During the debate the Trump War Room actually tweeted her statement that “Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people” — with a 100% symbol. At one point a moderator started out, “Congressman Gabbard, as president&mldr” Uh, no. David's grade: C. Repeating “Kamala Harris for the people” won’t win it for her. Nor will pointing out that her whole career has been in government. At least she didn’t get in trouble over her hypocritical positions as a prosecutor. Her “Trump got punked” response on North Korea was the best foreign policy answer of the night. Jill's grade: B-. She came across as tough when she said that “we have a criminal living in the White House” and that Trump had been “punked” by Kim Jong Un. But she also came across as preoccupied with identity politics — the candidate to best “rebuild the Obama coalition” and speak to people regardless of race, gender, geography, party, and so on. Does that cover everyone? She went through the list at least twice. I thought — hoped — that Democrats had transcended that way of thinking. It is not a winner. David's grade: F. I think this was her worst shaking performance yet. She looks like she needs to see a neurologist. I can’t see her standing up to Donald Trump until she has that under control. Jill's grade: B-. She got some mileage out of name checking (first and only to mention House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and almost-Georgia-governor Stacey Abrams) and her Senate record (“I have passed over 100 bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington”). But that is not the vision thing. In the more or less centrist lane, Biden and Buttigieg outdid her on that score Wednesday night. (I don't notice this shaking thing David keeps mentioning.) David's grade: C. Tonight was a good example of why the Vermont senator is a fading candidate, and it had nothing to do with his recent heart attack. It's just that we’ve heard all his answers before, and nothing has really changed from 2016. Jill's grade: B. He is as constant as a northern star, as Joni Mitchell might put it, with his trademark blunt rhetoric right out of the box: Trump as a historically corrupt, pathological liar, a health system that is cruel and dysfunctional, the terrible Iraq war that Biden supported and he opposed. He wants to bring home the troops — “and unlike Trump I will not do it through a tweet at 3 o’clock in the morning.” I don’t doubt that, but I do doubt he will have that chance. David's grade: T (for term limits). A gimmicky process argument isn’t going to give him any more traction than his focus on climate change. Jill's grade: C-. He is rich, he wants term limits and he’d be the climate president. Maybe that’s enough for some people. When will this field start shrinking instead of continuing to grow? David's grade: F. The Massachusetts senator put on display of why she would be a terrible general election candidate. Asked how she would bring the country together, she answered with her wealth tax. She actually argued that Republicans care about it just as much as Democrats and Independents. That’s delusional. Jill's grade: C+.  Are these people getting worse, or have we just heard it all before? Warren opened with a good segue from impeachment to the money-corrupted political system that brought us stunningly unqualified ambassador Gordon Sondland, but it was downhill from there. David's grade: D (as in the disappearing candidate). He spoke the least of the candidates, according to the Washington Post, and barely mentioned his signature issue, the $1,000 ""freedom dividend."" He did have a couple brave answers saying that “in many cases it would be better if a parent stayed home with the child” and acknowledging that the mass-shooting and right-wing terrorism problem in this country is a function of men and boys who “don’t have a path forward in today’s economy.” Jill's grade: B-. Yang showed with his imaginary Putin conversation (""I'm sorry I beat your guy"") that he can think on his feet. He's also funny, and seriously, how many women would know exactly which two countries in the world don't have paid maternity leave? But he's not going to be president, entertaining as that might be.

290,https://time.com/5735237/november-democratic-debate-recap/,"For two hours on Wednesday night, America’s regularly-scheduled politics programming switched subjects. Rather than focusing on chaotic impeachment inquiry hearings in Washington, all eyes were on the 10 Democratic candidates who qualified for the November Democratic debate in Atlanta to make their case in a setting that remains ever-important for keeping their campaigns alive. While the candidates broached topics that have dominated previous debates — such as health care and climate change — the all-women panel of moderators spent more time questioning the contenders about some of America’s other looming policy questions: What would the candidates do about the country’s housing crisis? How would they go about developing paid family leave proposals? In what ways would the competitors combat white supremacism? Here are TIME’s biggest takeaways from the debate. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had another solid debate performance, and there are early signs that it’s translating into the type of support that will keep him in the primary race. In addition to taking a direct hit at Biden over his recent comments that he would not pursue legalizing marijuana — “I thought you might have been high when you said it” — Booker also touted his credentials, including the fact that he is a Rhodes Scholar which is often overlooked in comparison to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Tonight’s commanding performance was typical for Booker, but his campaign has been mired in low polling. “We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again. … If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before because we need to mobilize a new American movement,” Booker said in a poignant plea to stay in the race as Lewis, a civil rights icon and Democratic member of the House of Representatives who represents an Atlanta district, watched from the audience. Booker’s deputy campaign manager tweeted that his compelling closing argument was done off-the-cuff, and that he’d raised more than $200,000 in the half hour since he spoke his last words on stage. — Lissandra Villa Moderators wasted no time asking the candidates on stage about the impeachment inquiry; it was the first question out of the gate. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s testimony earlier in the day to highlight why major donors are problematic and should not be rewarded with Ambassador posts (Sondland had donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee). Former Vice President Joe Biden insinuated that Trump’s desire to have the Ukrainians investigate him in the first place is an indication he is the strongest candidate in the field. But the candidates did have one unifying theme: no one seemed to want the ongoing probe in Washington to define either their candidacies or the race. “We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump,” warned Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Because if we are, you know what? We’re going to lose the election.” — Alana Abramson Former Vice President Joe Biden stumbled through yet another debate, erroneously claiming to have the backing of the only black woman elected to the Senate while sharing the stage with California Sen. Kamala Harris and pledged to fight for women’s right by “punching at it and punching at it and punching.” But the evening is unlikely to destroy his position in the top-tier of Democratic candidates. Part of the reason Biden has remained so durable despite cringe-inducing moments is that Democrats, more than anything, want someone who can trounce Trump next year. At this point, Biden remains a leading figure on that, in large part because of a deep well of support from older voters and African Americans. The experienced politician, who turned 77 on Wednesday, is widely seen as the best candidate to win back swing states that Trump carried in 2016 — although Harris returned several times to her ability to rebuild what she called the Obama Coalition and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar talked up her appeal to those swing voters, as well. At the same time, Biden drew fire from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker for his comments on marijuana policy and drug laws. Last weekend, Biden said he isn’t ready to legalize marijuana because there are so few medical studies on its long-term effects and said it could be a “gateway” drug to stronger drugs. (Biden says he supports the use of medical marijuana, would decriminalize the possession of marijuana and would allow the states to make decisions about marijuana’s recreational use.) Booker had a clever ding at the ready: “I thought you might have been high when you said it. … Marijuana has already been legal in our country for privileged people.” Biden flashed frustration at the attack and then calmed down. Worse has been said of him, and he’s still enjoying some of the broadest support in the Democratic field — at least for now. — Philip Elliott New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the Democratic primary in August, but it wasn’t until Wednesday night that one of her flagship proposals — paid family leave — got time on the debate stage. Although the vast majority of Americans support mandatory paid leave for new mothers, the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t guarantee paid parental leave through a federal law. One in four women have to return to work within two weeks of delivering a baby, according to a 2015 analysis by non-profit magazine In These Times. The all-women panel of moderators broached the subject early in their questions. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang used the opportunity to talk about how a positive home life — including whether parents have enough time to spend with their kids — increases children’s success later in life. He suggested requiring employers offer “at least nine months of paid family leave, distributed between parents however they see fit; or six months of paid leave for a single parent.” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose campaign has largely been defined by pragmatism, suggested a leaner offering. “My plan is three months, I think that’s good,” she said. “I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker, and then throw in a free car.” Though Warren, Sanders and Biden were not offered the opportunity to comment, Warren has advocated for a universal childcare policy with benefits based on a sliding scale and Sanders previously co-sponsored Gillibrand’s Senate bill to provide parents 12 weeks of paid leave. Biden’s campaign has not yet announced a paid family leave solution. — Abby Vesoulis Everyone expected South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg to spend much of his time on the defensive after a week of rising in the polls, but attacks from his competitors were surprisingly mild. Though his rivals have been grumbling about his steady rise, none of them went for the jugular when they criticized him on his failures to reach black voters or his lack of experience. Instead, Sen. Harris said “candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,” but declined to attack Buttigieg outright, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar cited her own long experience while briefly criticizing his lack of experience. Buttigieg was able to turn both moments into opportunities. When Harris alluded to his lack of support among black voters, he said “I completely agree” that his campaign has to do better, and used it as an opportunity to talk about inclusion and belonging. “While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” he said. And when Klobuchar said “I have actually done the work” in Washington while pointing out his relative lack of experience, he used it as a launchpad to portray himself as a Washington outsider. “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said. “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?” Only Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tried to land a full punch, when she attacked him for supposedly endorsing military intervention in Mexico, which he quickly and forcefully disputed. Overall, Buttigieg emerged largely unscathed, partly because his opponents took mostly veiled shots at him and partly because he was able to quickly own up to his shortcomings and use them as a way to tie into broader narratives about his candidacy. — Charlotte Alter While Sen. Harris avoided attacking Buttigieg directly over his campaign’s use of a stock photo of a Kenyan woman for his black outreach plan, she and Booker both used the evening to discuss their party’s outreach to black voters. “The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic party,” said Harris, one of the two black candidates on stage on Wednesday night. She went on to deride Democrats for only reaching out to black voters when they need their votes. “The question has to be, where you been, and what are you going to do?” Booker also made similar points, noting at one point that “black voters are pissed off” about Democrats not being there for them, pointedly saying Democrats shouldn’t need a focus group to hear from black voters. Booker, earlier in the day, had tweeted about the stock photograph. While Buttigieg is surging in Iowa and rising in New Hampshire, two early voting states, he has struggled in South Carolina, and with black voter outreach as a whole. In a recent South Carolina poll, he once again polled at 0% among black voters, his campaign has reportedly exaggerated support for his black outreach plan, in addition to the stock photo of a Kenyan woman. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t … know me,” Buttigieg said at the debate. He pointed to the adversity he has overcome as a gay man and how it helps him relate to other marginalized communities, “making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two election ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.” — Lissandra Villa The divide between moderates and progressives has shaped a lot of the conversation both in the 2020 Democratic primary and in previous debates, but in Wednesday’s debate that divide was only an undercurrent. That was due in part to the questions asked of the candidates, but also because Warren and Sanders, the two leading progressive candidates, did not make it a priority to put other candidates on the defensive over their lack of support for some of their ideas. However, it was clear there is still a lot of balking about some of their proposals from moderates. “As I’ve said before, I’d love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs. I just am not going to go for things … just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar alluding to some of the ideas progressives in the field have proposed (like free college). — Lissandra Villa Candidates sparred over how to address the America’s yawning income gap. The richest 1% of Americans now hold more wealth than the nation’s entire middle class, according to the Brookings Institution. But Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both self-described capitalists, disagreed over what to do about it. Warren has pledged to institute an “Ultra-Millionaire” 2% tax on individuals whose net worth is above $50 million and a 6% tax on those above $1 billion. During Wednesday’s debate, Warren argued that the roughly 75,000 households who are rich enough to be affected by her proposed tax didn’t achieve their success alone. “Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It’s about saying, ‘You built something great in this country? Good for you,’” the Massachusetts progressive said. “But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You’re getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.” Booker pushed against Warren’s calls to enact a formal wealth tax, arguing instead for other means of increasing tax revenue. “I don’t agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains,” he said. As the Democratic candidates’ platforms have shifted left, Booker may be trying to appeal to fellow capitalists who worry about the multi-trillion dollar plans — like free four-year college and erasing student debt nationwide — proposed by candidates like Warren and Sanders. Arguing that Americans should have both fair wages and equal opportunities to earn those wages could help Booker pick up some much-needed support from undecided and moderate Democrats as his campaign struggles to exceed 2-3% in national polls. “The people in communities I frequent, [their] aspiration is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity,” Booker said. “And that’s what our party has to be about.” — Abby Vesoulis While the moderators devoted little time to climate change with only a couple of questions on the issue, candidates pivoted to the issue anyway — an indication that candidates not only recognize the issue’s urgency but also that their campaigns view the issue as winner with voters. Asked about military service, Warren talked about Americans serving their country by working on public lands to fight climate change. Asked about farm subsidies, Buttigieg talked about making climate-sensitive farms “as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car.” And Sanders managed to slip in a reference to climate change in response to a question about impeachment. There’s good reason for this pivot beyond the urgency of the challenge: voters care about climate. A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month that show climate change running neck and neck with the health care as the top issue in New Hampshire. And many earlier polls show the issue in a similar place in Iowa. — Justin Worland While the debate allowed candidates to talk about a wider range of topics than in the past, many viewers noted that the absence of former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former HUD Secretary Julián Castro highlighted a lack of discussion around some issues such as gun violence, immigration and how violence can affect people of color. O’Rourke dropped out of the 2020 race earlier this month and while Castro is still running for President, he did not meet the polling requirement to participate in this month’s debate, and has been struggling to raise funds despite continuing to put out progressive policy ideas. Castro drew attention on the debate stage back in June when he challenged his fellow Democrats to decriminalize illegal immigration, and has earned support from activists for speaking out about police violence, as well as advocating for reproductive justice and for disability rights. O’Rourke, who is from El Paso, Texas, which saw a mass shooting in August, made gun control a focus of his campaign and stirred controversy when he proposed a mandatory buy back of assault weapons. Despite not being on the debate stage, Castro spent his evening tweeting along, and some of his supporters noted that his ideas were now being taken up by other candidates, such as when Elizabeth Warren said she believed abortion rights “are economic rights.” But others such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal lamented that no one took up the immigration mantle in Castro’s absence, and Warren herself said “we should have talked about gun violence” in her closing statement, something that O’Rourke would have no doubt agreed with. — Abigail Abrams Contact us at letters@time.com.",2019-11-21 02:06:09,"Booker Rises, Biden Stays Afloat and Nobody Wants to Dwell on Impeachment. 10 Takeaways From the November Debate","politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,election issues",4419,http://time.com
291,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guncontrol-children/more-u-s-children-die-in-mass-shootings-at-home-than-at-school-study-idUSKBN1XV185?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Brad Brooks 3 Min Read AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Three out of four U.S. children and teenagers killed in mass shootings over the past decade were victims of domestic violence and generally died in their homes, according to a study released on Thursday by the gun control group Everytown. here While the specter of school shootings looms darkly in the minds of American parents who remember massacres in Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida, and around the country, the group’s review of shootings from 2009 through 2018 found that far more children were killed in their own homes. “These are not random acts of violence, yet people have the perception that the killings come out of nowhere,” said Sarah Burd-Sharps, Everytown’s research director. “That is simply not the truth.” The Everytown report, based on police and court records as well as media reports, found that 54% of mass shootings involved the shooter killing a family member or an intimate partner. A total of 1,121 people were killed in 194 mass shootings in the decade examined, and one-third of those were children or teenagers. Nearly two-thirds of all mass shootings took place entirely inside homes, the study found. Burd-Sharps said Everytown hoped its report would help the public gain more understanding about the statistical realities of mass shootings, which it defines as an incident in which at least four people are killed, excluding the shooter. The federal government and other groups set a lower threshold for what constitutes a mass shooting. Those definitions can result in higher totals than Everytown’s count. Only 1% of the nearly 35,000 gun deaths averaged in the United States each year in the past decade involved mass shootings, but Burd-Sharps said she believed public interest in them could help propel gun-safety legislation that could cut gun deaths across the board. At the top of Everytown’s wish list was a “red flag” law that would allow family members or law enforcement officers to petition a judge to seize firearms from a person they think is a threat to themselves or others. The group also believed a comprehensive federal law requiring background checks on all gun sales would quickly be effective in decreasing gun deaths. The link between domestic violence in mass shootings was seen this week in San Diego, California, when a man who had a restraining order against him killed his wife and three of their four young sons before taking his own life. “When you look at all these cases of kids who lost their lives, if some family member had been able to heed the warning signs and temporarily had guns removed from the home, many of those children would still be alive,” Burd-Sharps said.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)  The weapon used in last week’s deadly mass shooting at Saugus High School was a so-called “ghost gun,” a firearm without a registration number, officials at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said on Thursday. Homicide detectives are looking for evidence regarding who purchased and assembled the firearm components and investigating the shooter’s purchase history by examining electronic devices seized from his home. Police say Nathan Berhow came to school the morning of Nov. 14, his 16th birthday, and opened fire with the .45-caliber handgun in the Santa Clarita high school’s quad. Five students were shot, with two later dying, before Berhow turned the weapon on himself. He later died. “The (detectives’) report on the firearm indicates that the handgun used in the assault was not manufactured conventionally and may be some form of a ‘kit gun,’ one that is assembled by a consumer — rather than a manufacturer — from pieces bought separately,” sheriff’s Capt. Kent Wegener wrote in a statement. “We have no evidence to indicate who assembled it or bought the components.” Wegener said detectives are still investigating social-media leads and looking for accounts belonging to the suspect. With assistance from the Secret Service, deputies are searching the contents of technology devices recovered from his home such as tablets, computers and cellphones. See also: Untraceable ‘ghost guns’ increasingly end up at California crime scenes Paperwork from the home will be examined “to see if it contains any evidence related to the subject’s state of mind, or historical information about the weapon used,” Wegener added. In a search of the boy’s home last week, law enforcement found several firearms, some of which were not registered. His father, who died of a heart attack almost two years ago, was described in an online obituary as an avid sportsman who “loved big-game hunting.” So-called ghost guns are legal weapons manufactured from mail-order parts or machined parts acquired from underground suppliers; they are untraceable because they lack serial numbers. Many are easy to assemble and can be purchased at gun shows in kit form. High-profile cases in Southern California in recent years suggest a rise in the proliferation of ghost guns, which pose investigative challenges for authorities. In August, one was used by a convicted felon who fatally shot California Highway Patrol officer Andre Moye Jr. during a lengthy gun battle following a traffic stop in Riverside. authorities said. In Santa Monica, gunman John Zawahri in 2013 killed five people using a rifle with assembled parts shipped from out of state and therefore lacking a serial number.

294,https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/jesuit-school-students-arrive-once-again-push-action-washington,"Jump to navigation Free Newsletters Advertisement Advertisement Arlington, Va. — Each year, the students flock to a hotel just outside of Washington. Like migrating birds signaling winter, you can tell the time of year by the arrival of the high schoolers, college students and young alumni from Jesuit universities around the country. They're the type who scream with joy listening to an 80-year-old nun and snap their fingers as they approve of something they've heard in the crowded ballroom of the Gateway Marriott in Arlington, where the event known as the Ignatian Family Teach-in for Justice has taken place the past few years. This Nov. 16-18, the event tied record attendance as more than 2,000 participated in two days of lectures about social justice — from immigration to poverty to climate change —  and a visit to Congress on the third day of the event, as the Ignatian Solidarity Network, which organizes it, sought to inform and encourage them to be active participants in matters that affect the poor and marginalized in the U.S. and elsewhere. ""We come together this weekend to reflect on the realities of the world, and to do the work of transforming structures through participation in public dialogue, where decisions are made,"" said Chris Kerr, the solidarity network's executive director. Those realities include racism, xenophobia, mistreatment of the Earth and marginalization of people because of their gender, sexual identity, immigration status and other forms of injustice, Kerr said. On Nov. 17, attendants listened to teens Juan Pablo Torrecillas and David Quezada, who live ""binational lives"" in the border cities of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico, serving food and spending time with migrants at a soup kitchen run by the Kino Border Initiative. The organization is associated with the Society of Jesus in the U.S. and Mexico, the Missionary Sisters of the Eucharist, and the dioceses of Tucson, Arizona, and Nogales, Mexico. Torrecillas talked about meeting women and children stranded at the border as he served them and listened to the hardships that led them to flee from their home countries. He spoke about how he worried for their safety, wishing he could do something for them. ""It's an awful feeling,"" he said. ""The system of immigration is broken."" Quezada spoke of how he admired a 22-year-old from Honduras he met on the street, hardworking and with dreams, cobbling to make a living. He was saving to buy him a pair of shoes. Among the crowd of those who listened to the teens, one related that he experienced backlash from his peers at school as he talked about helping migrants. ""You can't fight ignorance with ignorance,"" Torrecillas told him. They counseled him to keep helping those he could and said that even as the situation on the border was ""heartbreaking,"" they were resolved to help. ""It's awful to see kids treated like animals,"" Torrecillas said. ""It's not their fault but we have to try to help them."" Most of the dozens of topics the students and young adults heard the first two days dealt with themes negatively affecting those on the margins of society. The event, now in its 27th year, was inspired by the work of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus, and a group of Jesuits killed in 1989 because of their work with the marginalized of El Salvador. Organizers expose the attendants to topics inside and outside of the United States that involve the poor, the oppressed and disenfranchised, and try to spring them into action of some form. It's grown so much — some had to be turned away, Kerr said — that it's moving to a bigger venue in 2021. One of the most popular talks of the weekend was by Jesuit Father James Martin of America magazine Nov. 16. He spoke of how, when he went to school in the late 1970s and 1980s, the university he attended sponsored a day supporting the gay community and it meant showing solidarity with that community by wearing jeans. Though he wore jeans all the time, he didn't want to do so on that occasion, ""not because I was against gay people, but the idea of being in any way associated with gay people back then ... was so frightening for me,"" he said However, after he became a Jesuit novice in the late 1980s and heard about the death of the Jesuit martyrs of El Salvador, he said he felt at that moment that perhaps he didn't understand what Christianity truly was. But seeing the Jesuits give their lives for the marginalized, as well as four American churchwomen also killed in El Salvador, changed him. After entering the order, he felt his place was to be with people on the margins, whoever that might be. That journey took him to work in East Africa with refugees and later with migrants. But when he went to work in New York City, he came across gay and lesbian men and women and began from time to time advocating for them through his writing in the Jesuit-run America magazine. ""But I never thought that I would really be invested in that ministry,"" he said. However, that changed after a mass shooting at a gay night club in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, when he said he noticed church leaders offered their condolences for other groups after such incidents, yet they had a hard time speaking out for those who died in Orlando. Even when condolences were offered, the word ""gay"" didn't appear in their statements. ""So, I wrote this talk, which was very simple, and it was based on the catechism, which calls for respect, compassion and sensitivity for LGBT people or for people of homosexual orientation,"" he said. ""I also suggested that it might be good to look at the Gospel once in a while to see how Jesus treated people who were on the margins, and we know how Jesus treated people who were on the margins: He went to them first."" The group also listened to a keynote speech on solidarity by 80-year-old Sr. Peggy O'Neill, of the Sisters of Charity, who has worked in El Salvador for 30 years. ""Solidarity is an attitude, a virtue, a duty. It is a firm determination to commit oneself to the common good,"" she said, encouraging the students to ""get a life."" She told the group, headed to advocate in the halls of Congress two days later, about what her time in El Salvador taught her, learning from those who had little but shared whatever they had with others, and of the faith they showed in times of deep tragedy, encouraging the students to build a better world. ""I want to challenge you, really, to get a life. ... Be midwives to assist at the birthing of a world so long emerging but truly off course,"" she said. ""Help birth new economic structures, new agents of evolution, new ways of seeing the universe, maybe even to see the universe as the ecstasy of God."" All living things are evolving and connected and share in the DNA of God, she said. ""I dare you to be midwives of solidarity,"" she said. ""Get a life where you are not alone. Find people you love and people who love you, get a life in which you are generous."" Advertisement Advertisement Enter your email address to receive free newsletters from NCR.

Gaga rose to fame with pop hits like ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face,"" but she's proven to be an impressive actress as well. Gaga took her acting career to new heights by starring alongside Bradley Cooper in a 2018 remake of ""A Star Is Born."" The 33-year-old's role as singer-songwriter Ally earned her recognition at this year's major award shows. She kicked off 2019 by winning the Golden Globe for best original song for a motion picture for ""Shallow"" (from ""A Star Is Born"") and earned a nomination for best performance by an actress in a drama motion picture. Gaga went on to earn two SAG Award nominations and five total Grammy Award nominations. At the latter award show, she went home with three trophies: best pop solo performance for ""Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?),"" best pop duo/group performance for ""Shallow,"" and best song written for visual media for ""Shallow."" The entertainer also won her first Oscar. ""Shallow"" beat out the competition to nab the award for best original song and Gaga was nominated for best leading actress. Aside from ""A Star Is Born,"" Gaga continued her Las Vegas residency, which will end in 2020, and launched her own makeup line in September called Haus Laboratories. The collection (comprised of lip liners, gloss, and eyeliner, among other beauty products) was praised for its quality and sleek design. Gaga's also working on her sixth studio album and is set to star in a Ridley Scott-directed film about the Gucci family. She'll play Patrizia Reggiani, the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci.   In February, siblings Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas returned to the spotlight as a band and released a catchy new song called ""Sucker,"" which reached the No. 1 spot on pop music charts. Their accompanying music video for the track also gained plenty of attention for featuring all their partners: Priyanka Chopra (who wed Nick in December 2018), Sophie Turner (Joe's then fiancée and now wife after tying the knot in Las Vegas in May), and Danielle Jonas (Kevin's wife since 2009). The band also released an Amazon documentary called ""Chasing Happiness,"" which took viewers through their rise to fame, complete with shocking revelations and heartfelt moments. In June, they released their fifth studio album called ""Happiness Begins"" and embarked on a tour with shows scheduled from August 2019 through February 2020. They also planned on releasing a memoir titled ""Blood"" in November 2019, but it has now been pushed back to March 17, 2020. The Jonas Brothers won an MTV Video Music Award for best pop video for ""Sucker,"" plus two Teen Choice Awards for choice summer group and the decade award. The 17-year-old Los Angeles native wasn't completely unknown prior to this year (""Ocean Eyes"" was her first big track), but her debut album titled ""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?"" added to her popularity. In April, she made history as the first artist born in the 2000s to have a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. Eilish's dark-pop sound and whisper-like vocals, heard in songs like ""Bad Guy"" and ""Bury a Friend,"" set her apart from other musicians. The accompanying music videos for those two tracks also have a combined total of more than 900 million views. The singer also appeared at Coachella, made her ""Saturday Night Live"" debut with a trippy, gravity-defying performance, and embarked on a tour. In November, Eilish released a new track called ""Everything I Wanted."" She also got nominated for six Grammy Awards and made history as the youngest artist to be nominated in all of the show's top categories. Malek was praised for his performance in the 2018 film and was a popular face at 2019's major award shows. He won a Golden Globe, a SAG Award, and an Academy Award for his leading role in the biopic. At the award shows, the actor also went viral for introducing himself to Lady Gaga, getting his bow tie adjusted by the ""Star Is Born"" actress, and having an awkward onstage moment with Nicole Kidman. Malek also returned as computer hacker Elliot Alderson for the fourth and final season of USA's ""Mr. Robot"" and will be starring as the villain in the upcoming ""James Bond"" film called ""No Time to Die."" The movie hits theaters on April 8, 2020.  Grande skipped on attending the award show in February, but she won the award for best pop vocal album for 2018's ""Sweetener."" In 2019, she also won three awards at the MTV VMAs and two trophies at the Billboard Music Awards. The 26-year-old singer enjoyed success with ""7 Rings"" from her 2019 album ""Thank U, Next"" and headlined Coachella. She also became the first artist to occupy the top three spots on the Billboard 100 chart since The Beatles in 1964 with ""7 Rings,"" ""Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored,"" and ""Thank U, Next."" Grande served as a coexecutive producer for the ""Charlie's Angels"" reboot soundtrack and lent her voice to a few songs, including ""Don't Call Me Angel"" with Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey. In addition, she teamed up with Lizzo for a remix of ""Good as Hell"" and kicked off her Sweetener World Tour in March 2019. Aside from going viral for his acts of kindness, the actor starred in several movies. He played the titular character in ""John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,"" which earned a critics score of 90% and an audience rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. The actor also had a scene-stealing role as himself in the 
                                      
Netflix
 comedy ""Always Be My Maybe"" and went on to become a meme. Reeves voiced motorcycle stuntman action figure Duke Caboom in ""Toy Story 4"" and fans were also thrilled that the actor was named the new face of Saint Laurent. Reeves even had a humble, priceless reaction to being labeled the ""internet's boyfriend."" ""I've been what?"" Reeves told Entertainment Weekly and PeopleTV in June. ""That's wacky. The positivity's great. It was really special how 'John Wick' was embraced, and working on 'Always Be My Maybe,' great. Ali Wong and Randall Park [are] just really wonderful artists and people, and it was just really cool to get a chance to play with them."" To celebrate his success and decades-long career, Reeves participated in a hand and footprint ceremony at Hollywood's TCL Chinese Theatre in May. It was also revealed that he'll reprise his role as Neo for a fourth ""Matrix"" movie. Next, you can catch Reeves playing a wise tumbleweed in ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run,"" in theaters on May 22, 2020. Lopez showed no signs of slowing down in 2019. She performed a controversial Motown tribute at the Grammys, went on a strict 10-day no-carb, no-sugar challenge to prepare for her role as a stripper in ""Hustlers,"" and learned how to pole dance for the film. In March, Lopez and former athlete Alex Rodriguez got engaged while on vacation in the Bahamas, after dating for two years. In July, the ""Let's Get Loud"" singer turned 50 and celebrated the milestone with a lavish party in Miami. Lopez starred in and produced ""Hustlers,"" which hit theaters in September and was inspired by a New York magazine article written by Jessica Pressler. The film was praised by critics and fans, and Lopez has received tons of Oscar buzz for her performance as a stripper named Ramona. The entertainer also went viral for Lopez closing out Versace's Milan Fashion Week show by strutting down the runway in a dress nearly identical to the jungle one that she wore at the 2000 Grammys. In addition, it was revealed that she and Shakira will be co-headlining the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, Florida. The film, released in May 2019, struck a balance between extravagant musical numbers and harrowing scenes addressing John's rocky history with sexuality, drugs, and alcohol. Egerton, who sang all his tracks in the movie, was praised for his portrayal of the music prodigy. ""Rocketman"" costar Bryce Dallas Howard also told Insider that Egerton's transformation was ""unreal"" and the actor captured John's ""essence."" It wouldn't be surprising if Egerton nabbed a few leading actor nominations for the upcoming award show season.  ""Captain Marvel"" hit theaters in March and was a significant moment for Marvel because it was the studio's first standalone movie centered on a female character. It also hit $1 billion at the box office. Months later, she appeared in ""Endgame"" to help the Avengers in their fight against Thanos. Outside of the MCU, the actress appeared in Netflix's ""Between Two Ferns: The Movie."" At the 2019 MTV Movie and TV Awards, Larson won the trophy for best fight for her character's epic battle against Minn-Erva in ""Captain Marvel."" Larson has also been outspoken about the need for diversity and inclusion in Hollywood. She's been rallying for an all-female Marvel movie and has voiced support for Captain Marvel and Valkyrie (played by Tessa Thompson) becoming the MCU's first same-sex couple. Paul, who won an Emmy for his performance as Jesse Pinkman on ""Breaking Bad,"" starring in ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie."" Fans had no idea that a sequel was in the works, so they were thrilled when it was officially announced in August. The film was released on the streaming service in October and although it wasn't heavy on the action that ""Breaking Bad"" fans might have gotten accustomed to, it provided closure for the beloved character, who escaped from a neo-Nazi compound during the 2013 series finale. ""El Camino"" was filled with Easter eggs and nods to the original series, and Paul easily slipped back into character for a thrilling performance. The movie earned a 90% critics score and 81% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The term ""self-made"" being applied to Jenner, who has grown up in the spotlight as the daughter of Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner, caused waves of backlash. She initially defended it, saying that her parents ""cut her off"" when she was 15 and she ""spent every last dime that I had"" on launching Kylie Cosmetics. Two months later, she told the New York Times: ""I can't say I've done it by myself. If they're just talking finances, technically, yes, I don't have any inherited money. But I have had a lot of help and a huge platform."" Regardless of how she reached the financial milestone though, Jenner did cross the billionaire threshold this year. Jenner also expanded her billion-dollar fortune by launching Kylie Skin and selling ""rise and shine"" merchandise after a video of herself briefly singing to daughter Stormi Webster went viral and turned into a meme. Waller-Bridge created, starred, executive produced, and wrote episodes of ""Fleabag."" She racked up Emmys for outstanding comedy series, outstanding lead actress in a comedy series, and outstanding writing for a comedy series. The actress also reportedly signed a deal with Amazon Studios to continue creating projects for the streaming service. According to Variety, Waller-Bridge's deal is worth approximately $20 million a year. In addition, Waller-Bridge created the award-winning drama ""Killing Eve"" and hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in October. She also worked on the script for the upcoming ""James Bond"" film and is the second woman to be given a writing credit in the history of the action franchise.  Lil Nas X's remix of the track, which seamlessly blends hip-hop and country sounds, featured Billy Ray Cyrus and peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song, which was deemed the track of the summer, maintained the top spot on the chart for 19 weeks. The 20-year-old's achievement made history as the longest-running No. 1 track, dethroning Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's ""Despacito,"" (featuring Justin Bieber) and Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men's ""One Sweet Day."" ""Old Town Road"" is also one of 33 songs in history that have been certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The accompanying music video accumulated more than 350 million views on YouTube and the remix has more than 700 million streams on Spotify. Lil Nas X also publicly came out as gay during Pride Month, released a new EP (which included the track ""Panini""), won two MTV Video Music Awards, snagged a Country Music Award, and got nominated for six 2020 Grammys. In May, ""Red Table Talk"" returned for a second season, hosted by Pinkett Smith, daughter Willow Smith, and mother Adrienne Banfield Norris. On season two, the stars once again had candid conversations, exploring the impact of pornography on relationships, infidelity, interracial adoption, mother-daughter dynamics, narcissism, and white privilege. Season two also featured guests like Demi Moore, Rumer Willis, Tallulah Willis, Chelsea Handler, Alicia Keys, Jordyn Woods, and Ayesha Curry. The series, which is a game-changer in the talk show realm, was nominated for a Critics' Choice Real TV award and a People's Choice Award. Pinkett Smith was also presented with the Trailblazer Award at the 2019 MTV Movie and TV Awards in June. The actress starred as Billi in the film, which centered on a family traveling to China to spend time with the matriarch before her death. The movie was a change for Awkwafina, who previously showed off her comedic skills in films like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""Ocean's Eight."" Regardless, viewers enjoyed it. ""The Farewell"" earned a critics score of 99% and an audience rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2019, Awkwafina also voiced characters on ""The Simpsons,"" ""The Angry Birds Movie 2,"" and ""The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance."" She also joined the MCU with a role in the upcoming film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"" scheduled to hit theaters on Friday, February 12, 2021. In December, she'll star alongside Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in ""Jumanji: The Next Level."" Momoa voiced Aquaman in the 2019 ""Lego Movie"" sequel and guest-starred on ""The Simpsons."" He also stars as Baba Voss on the dystopian series ""See,"" which dropped on the streaming service in November. In addition, he shaved off his beard for the first time in seven years to raise awareness about being more environmentally conscious — and promote his new company called Mananalu, which packages water in aluminum cans that can be recycled, unlike single-use plastic bottles. Next, Momoa will star as Duncan Idaho in the 2020 sci-fi film ""Dune,"" based on a book by Frank Herbert. The cast includes Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, and Dave Bautista. In 2022, Momoa will reprise his role as Aquaman for a sequel. It's unclear what the film will center on, but the actor told Esquire that he ""came in with a big pitch."" ""I came in with the whole thing mapped out, and they loved it,"" he said.  ""Truth Hurts,"" which was initially released in 2017, took off in 2019 and led Lizzo to earn her first No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The track was included as a bonus song on the deluxe version of her 2019 album ""Cuz I Love You"" and its music video has 150 million views. Lizzo's ""Cuz I Love You"" album also includes her catchy song ""Juice."" Another Lizzo song also gained more traction in 2019. ""Good as Hell,"" which came out in 2016 as part of her ""Coconut Oil"" album, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in. She went on to release a remix of the track with Ariana Grande. Lizzo also performed at Coachella and collaborated with Charli XCX for ""Blame It on Your Love."" Outside of music, she voiced a character in the animated movie ""UglyDolls"" and had a role in ""Hustlers."" In addition, the 31-year-old musician led the 2020 Grammy nominations with eight total nods.    Holland starred as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the blockbuster film ""Avengers: Endgame,"" which passed ""Avatar"" as the biggest movie of all time at the global box office. A few months later, he once again played the webslinger in ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" which directly followed the events of ""Endgame."" Both films crossed the $1 billion mark at the box office. In August, Holland's future with Marvel was shaken up after Deadline reported that Sony and Disney were unable to reach a financial agreement regarding Spider-Man. As a result, the Marvel Studios president, Kevin Feige, wouldn't produce any future ""Spider-Man"" films and Holland's version of the character wouldn't be able to appear in the MCU. The following month, it was revealed that the studios ended their feud and will be coproducing the upcoming third ""Spider-Man"" film, which hits theaters on July 16, 2021. Fans rejoiced and the 23-year-old reacted to the good news by posting a scene from ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" which showed Leonardo DiCaprio's character giving a speech about ""not leaving."" Holland recently shaved off his hair for his role in a movie called ""Cherry"" with the Russo Brothers and will voice a character alongside Will Smith in the animated movie ""Spies in Disguise."" The film hits theaters on December 25, 2019. In 2020, you can expect to see him star in six movies: ""Dolittle"" with Robert Downey Jr., ""The Devil All the Time,"" ""Chaos Walking,"" Pixar's ""Onward,"" ""Cherry,"" and ""Uncharted."" After starring as the titular character on Disney Channel's ""K.C. Undercover,"" Zendaya switched gears for her role as Rue on HBO's racy series about the modern teenage experience. ""Euphoria"" premiered in June 2019 and got renewed for a second season. In addition, the 23-year-old actress appeared on ""The OA"" and starred in the ""Spider-Man"" sequel. Next year, Zendaya will star in a film adaptation of ""Dune."" Outside of acting, Zendaya became Lancôme's global ambassador and collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger for a '70s-inspired collection that debuted at New York Fashion Week in September. She stunned in stylish outfits at 2019 award shows, too.     Pitt played stuntman Cliff Booth in the Quentin Tarantino-directed movie ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."" The film, which also starred Leonardo DiCaprio, was certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with a critics score of 85% and an audience rating of 70%.  Pitt also delivered a crowd-pleasing performance as an astronaut in ""Ad Astra."" Aside from acting, Pitt also served as the executive producer for ""The OA"" and ""Sweetbitter."" He produced ""Ad Astra"" and Netflix's ""The King"" starring Timothée Chalamet, too. In May, Rihanna kicked off the launch of her Fenty fashion brand with a pop-up store in Paris on Wednesday. The collection was also made available online. People also praised the fashion line for releasing promotional photos that appeared to be unedited and showed imperfections. This year, French luxury goods giant LVMH acquired Fenty and Rihanna became the ""first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,"" according to the New York Times. In June, she was crowned the world's richest female musician, with an estimated net worth of $600 million, according to Forbes. Three months later, Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie show took place as part of New York Fashion Week and was available to stream on Amazon Prime Video. Fans loved that the show featured a diverse group of models with varying shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds. In October, she released a self-titled visual autobiography featuring 1,050 behind-the-scenes photos from her glamorous life. Rihanna also made headlines for calling out President Donald Trump's response to the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, going day drinking with Seth Meyers, and starring in a film called  ""Guava Island"" alongside Donald Glover/Childish Gambino.  Downey Jr. made his debut as the ""genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist"" in ""Iron Man,"" which was released 11 years ago. Since then, he's been a key player in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is referred to as ""the godfather"" by costar Tom Holland. In ""Avengers: Endgame,"" Tony made the ultimate sacrifice for his family and friends by wielding the power of the six Infinity Stones to snap away Thanos and his army. Because of the power of the stones, he didn't survive. The result was a gut-wrenching death season and emotional funeral near the end of the blockbuster film. Even though that's the last time we'll see Downey Jr. suit up as Iron Man, MCU costar Jeff Goldblum said that the actor will voice the character for Marvel's upcoming animated series called ""What If...?"" The actor was also honored with the Disney Legends Award at Disney's D23 convention in Anaheim, California in August. At San Diego Comic Con, fans went wild when Jolie was revealed as one of the stars of the upcoming Marvel film ""The Eternals,"" which is part of the company's phase four and is set for release on Friday, November 6, 2020. Jolie will portray an immortal named Thena who has super strength and can fly in the comics, and it looks like she'll be wearing a blonde wig for the role. The star-studded cast includes Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, and Salma Hayek. Jolie also reprised her starring role for ""Maleficient: Mistress of Evil."" The film earned a 95% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes (thought critics weren't big fans of the sequel) and grossed $400 million worldwide. At the Oscars, the 50-year-old actor stunned in a tuxedo dress complete with a full skirt. Porter also wore eye-catching looks to the Met Gala and the Peabody Awards. He also wore a rainbow gown to celebrate the Pride parade in New York City and showed support for women's reproductive rights with his Tony Awards outfit. Porter was also one of many stars to appear in Taylor Swift's music video for ""You Need to Calm Down."" Porter made history at the 2019 Emmys when he became the first openly gay man to win an Emmy for best actor in a drama series for his role of Pray Tell on FX's ""Pose."" The single from the album, ""Me!"" featuring Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie, broke the record for most views in 24 hours. It also became the fastest video to reach 100 million views on Vevo, doing so in 79 hours, Variety reported. ""Me!"" went on to win the MTV VMA for best visual effects, too. Swift's ""Lover"" debuted at the top spot on the Billboard Hot 200, becoming her sixth consecutive album to achieve the feat. ""Lover"" also won album of the year at the People's Choice Awards and Swift was presented with the Icon Award at the Teen Choice Awards in August. In November, she received three Grammy nominations for the 2020 awards show. At Billboard's upcoming Women in Music event on December 12, Swift will be presented with the award for Woman of the Decade, the first artist to receive the distinction. She will also be honored as the Artist of the Decade during Sunday's American Music Awards. The ""Archer"" singer will star as Bombalurina in the film ""Cats,"" based on a Broadway show of the same name. She also wrote a new song for the film titled ""Beautiful Ghosts"" with Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Singh rose to fame with her candid and humorous videos posted on YouTube, which were shared under the username IISuperwomanII. In February 2019, Singh publicly came out as bisexual, calling herself ""female,"" ""colored,"" and ""bisexual."" ""Throughout my life these have proven to be obstacles from time to time,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""But now I'm fully embracing them as my superpowers. No matter how many 'boxes' you check, I encourage you to do the same."" She went on to thank fans for their outpouring of ""love and positivity. Words can't describe how much it means. I appreciate you all. Group hug."" In September, the internet personality made her late-night debut with ""A Little Late With Lilly Singh"" on NBC. She became the first openly bisexual woman of color to land a late-night talk show. . Todd Phillips' ""The Joker"" hit theaters in October and drew criticism for the connection between mental illness and violence, but people were also impressed by Phoenix's terrifying, chilling performance as the iconic comic-book character. In several interviews, the actor explained how he transformed into Arthur Fleck by losing 52 pounds. Phoenix told Jimmy Kimmel that losing weight was so challenging that he had to motivate himself to climb stairs, but he also found it to be ""empowering."" Stars like Jessica Chastain called Phoenix's take on the Joker one of the ""greatest pieces of acting"" she's ever seen and the film has generated plenty of Oscar buzz. The hype surrounding ""Joker"" also led fans to flock to stairs in the Bronx that were featured in the film so they could take Instagram-worthy photos and videos (which resulted in outrage among the borough's residents), and the character was a popular choice for attendees at New York Comic Con. ""Joker"" went on to hit $1 billion at the box office and become the first R-rated movie in history to do so.  The actress cohosted the show with ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" star Andy Samberg in January. In addition to being the first person of Asian descent to host the awards show, Oh won the trophy for best performance by an actress in a drama TV series for playing the titular character on ""Killing Eve."" She also became the first woman of Asian descent to win that award since Yoko Shimada did so in 1980 for ""Shogun."" This win paired with a previous Golden Globe that she won for her supporting role on ""Grey's Anatomy"" made Oh the first woman of Asian descent to win multiple Golden Globes. In her emotional acceptance speech, the actress spoke in Korean and told her parents that she loves them, then bowed to them respectfully from the stage. Oh went on to host ""Saturday Night Live"" in March and is the third Asian woman to do so, following in the footsteps of Lucy Liu and Awkwafina. Since ""Friends"" ended in 2004, Aniston had a few guest-starring parts on TV shows like ""30 Rock"" and ""Cougar Town."" Her role as Alex Levy on Apple TV Plus' drama ""The Morning Show"" marked her return after years of primarily starring in comedies. The show was released on the streaming service in November 2019, but actually got renewed for a second season two years prior. In 2019, Aniston also starred alongside Adam Sandler in Netflix's ""Murder Mystery."" Critics didn't like the comedy, but it broke Netflix viewing records. ""Murder Mystery"" also led Aniston to win a Peoples' Choice Award for favorite female movie star. The actress finally made her debut on Instagram in October by posting an epic selfie with all her ""Friends"" costars. Word about Aniston being on the app spread so quickly that the platform faced a few technical issues as millions of people tried to follow her. She gained 1 million followers in just five hours and 16 minutes, setting a record recognized by the Guinness World Records for the fastest time for an Instagram account to reach that milestone. The record was previously held by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.    Witherspoon reprised her role as Madeline Martha Mackenzie on HBO's ""BLL,"" which returned for its second season in June. According to costar Nicole Kidman, it's still unclear if the show will get renewed for a third season. On ""The Morning Show,"" Witherspoon stars as Bradley Jackson and serves as an executive producer. The actress also continues to make strides with her multimedia company Hello Sunshine, which was launched in 2016. The brand, which pushes for more stories centered on females, will produce a new miniseries on Netflix starring Zoe Saldana. In addition, Witherspoon has a book club and somehow found time to learn about the latest app that's popular among youths, TikTok. In September, she posted a video on Instagram that showed son Deacon Phillippe answering all her burning questions about the popular app and demonstrated how to perform different dances that are popular on the platform. The following month, Witherspoon appeared on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" and showed the late night host how to ""Hit the Woah,"" referring to a move in which people move their arms in a short, circular motion as a beat drops on a song.   Feldstein, who's the sister of Jonah Hill, previously had roles in movies like ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" and ""Lady Bird."" But her leading role alongside Kaitlyn Dever in ""Booksmart"" made her one to watch in 2019. The coming-of-age movie, which got a 97% critics score and 77% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, centered on two friends who decide to party shortly before graduating from high school. ""Booksmart"" was referred to as a female version of ""Superbad"" with a fresh spin and people loved Feldstein's performance.

The Chicago Bears got in touch with me, and then Gomez, after reading the column I wrote about the Aurora police officer at the six-month anniversary of the Henry Pratt Co. mass shooting, where five employees were shot to death Feb. 15 by a disgruntled employee who also wounded another employee and five cops, with Gomez receiving the most life-threatening injuries. I had wanted to write about Gomez for a while, as I was aware of the officer’s incredible back story: He not only has a mass murderer’s bullet, that struck his femoral artery, still lodged in his left leg, the former Marine also has shrapnel in his right leg, the result of an injury he received while on his second tour of duty in Iraq. So really, the Marco Gomez story is so compelling, even a fifth-grader could have written it and it would have caught the attention of a big PR machine. And it’s just the kind of story that would indeed appeal to an NFL organization, particularly in November when leagues across the country are doing their best to honor our veterans. According to Matt Simeone, director of community and alumni relations, the goal of the Chicago Bears Community Connections program “is to reach out to fans who have gone through a tough time or hardship"" and reward them not only with a unique experience but some cool gifts, including a $1,000 gift card from Jewel-Osco. When I caught up with Gomez again after I heard from the Bears group, the 40-year-old Community Oriented Policing officer admitted to going a bit stir crazy at home following an operation in September on his meniscus, which has postponed his return to the streets until the new year, possibly even as late as February. So getting this call from the Bears Lake Forest headquarters was a welcome surprise, although, he told me, he’s more than a little uncomfortable with the attention that will be focused on him in that big stadium. In the four or so years since I first met this Aurora cop – first, as part of a Santa program for at-risk kids, then later as the first officer shot running into that Pratt warehouse – he’s always been wary of attention, especially from the media, as it often takes away from the job at hand. So whenever he can, Gomez automatically tries to focus the spotlight back on others. This chat was no exception. Gomez insists the only hero he wants to be is the one to his family, including wife Carly and most especially his three small children. But he also realizes the bullets he and four colleagues took on that horrible day in February, as well as the risks other officers assumed when they went after the gunman, have clearly shown the rest of us what first responders are willing to do in order to protect their community. “It shows that our word is gold,” he said, “and that we don’t just talk the talk but walk the walk.” When I reminded Gomez he was also injured as a Marine in Iraq – he had taken a few extra moments to warn an approaching shepherd after detonating a bomb and didn’t quite get his right leg inside the Humvee when the timing fuse went off – and that Sunday was also about his service to country, he paused for a moment before admitting he’d “not even thought about that” part of the story. November, he told me, is an especially tough time of year because in 2004 his unit in Iraq lost eight men in that one month alone. That included two good friends – Cpl. Peter Giannopoulos of Barrington, who was killed in a firefight on Veterans Day, and Cpl. Nathan Hammond of Missouri, who was killed by an IED explosion three days earlier. “So what the Bears are doing is kind of a big deal,” Gomez said, adding that the death of those two friends “made me who I am today.” Now you can see why I’m so thrilled this Aurora officer’s story will be shared with an even wider audience. As part of the day, he and his family – who happen to be legitimate Bears fans, even in this less than stellar season – will be recognized in the pregame show. Gomez is not really sure what else the day will entail, except there will be “some sort of interview.” And whether or not we will get to see or hear it, I can all but guarantee what will be going through the Aurora officer’s head when he takes his turn in the spotlight: This is for every person in uniform who takes that sacred oath to serve, protect and, if need be, pay the ultimate price ... I wish they could be here with me now. dcrosby@tribpub.com CONNECT TRIBUNE PUBLISHING COMPANY INFO Copyright © 2021, Chicago Tribune",2019-11-21 16:54:16,Chicago Bears to honor Aurora’s hometown hero Officer Marco Gomez,police,9,http://www.chicagotribune.com/

The week's public impeachment inquiry hearings are over. And the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is canceled. It’s Ashley. Let’s talk news, shall we? But first, the long way home: No one’s quite sure how a 6-year-old cat made it from Oregon to New Mexico. But five years after he vanished, Sasha finally made it home. The Short List newsletter is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe here! In 1995, Leonard Forte was due to face charges that he'd repeatedly raped and molested his daughter's 12-year-old friend. Instead, he started dying. Forte, then a 54-year-old former detective in New York, told the court his doctors had given him a grim diagnosis: Without a heart transplant, he’d be dead within a year. A prosecutor agreed to delay the case until Forte was healthy enough to stand trial – unless his terminal condition made prosecuting him a moot point. Forte never received a heart transplant. But he also didn’t die. Instead, he has been living as a retiree in Florida, collecting boats, taking vacations and successfully fending off his trial by professing for more than two decades that he’s on the verge of death. We know President Donald Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a ""favor"" on July 25: To investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son. At the same time, $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine was left in limbo. But just how connected was the favor to the aid? David Holmes and Fiona Hill, two central witnesses to the Ukraine pressure campaign, testified publicly Thursday in the impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. The two cap off the dozen witnesses called so far to testify publicly in House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry. Does this mean a vote on impeachment is coming soon? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday: “We haven’t made any decision yet.” The Victoria's Secret angels won’t be strutting down the runway this year. According to the lingerie brand’s parent company, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is officially canceled for 2019. The brand said the decision was part of a move to ""evolve the marketing of Victoria's Secret.” The show in recent years has been hit with bad publicity, bad reviews and bad numbers. Syracuse Police Department arrested an 18-year-old girl in connection to recent incidents of graffiti that appeared to be supporting anti-racism protests at the university, authorities said Thursday. The announcement came hours after Syracuse Chancellor Ken Syverud bowed to the demands of students protesting the school’s handling of a two-week run of almost daily racist, anti-Semitic incidents. At least a dozen incidents of racist heckling and other issues have been reported to campus police since Nov. 7, including a white supremacist manifesto that was posted on a campus forum, prompting fears among some students that a mass shooting could erupt. Syverud later described the incident as a hoax.

299,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/time/topstories/~3/kew7bhlkCKs/,"For two hours on Wednesday night, America’s regularly-scheduled politics programming switched subjects. Rather than focusing on chaotic impeachment inquiry hearings in Washington, all eyes were on the 10 Democratic candidates who qualified for the November Democratic debate in Atlanta to make their case in a setting that remains ever-important for keeping their campaigns alive. While the candidates broached topics that have dominated previous debates — such as health care and climate change — the all-women panel of moderators spent more time questioning the contenders about some of America’s other looming policy questions: What would the candidates do about the country’s housing crisis? How would they go about developing paid family leave proposals? In what ways would the competitors combat white supremacism? Here are TIME’s biggest takeaways from the debate. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had another solid debate performance, and there are early signs that it’s translating into the type of support that will keep him in the primary race. In addition to taking a direct hit at Biden over his recent comments that he would not pursue legalizing marijuana — “I thought you might have been high when you said it” — Booker also touted his credentials, including the fact that he is a Rhodes Scholar which is often overlooked in comparison to South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Tonight’s commanding performance was typical for Booker, but his campaign has been mired in low polling. “We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again. … If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before because we need to mobilize a new American movement,” Booker said in a poignant plea to stay in the race as Lewis, a civil rights icon and Democratic member of the House of Representatives who represents an Atlanta district, watched from the audience. Booker’s deputy campaign manager tweeted that his compelling closing argument was done off-the-cuff, and that he’d raised more than $200,000 in the half hour since he spoke his last words on stage. — Lissandra Villa Moderators wasted no time asking the candidates on stage about the impeachment inquiry; it was the first question out of the gate. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren used E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s testimony earlier in the day to highlight why major donors are problematic and should not be rewarded with Ambassador posts (Sondland had donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee). Former Vice President Joe Biden insinuated that Trump’s desire to have the Ukrainians investigate him in the first place is an indication he is the strongest candidate in the field. But the candidates did have one unifying theme: no one seemed to want the ongoing probe in Washington to define either their candidacies or the race. “We cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump,” warned Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Because if we are, you know what? We’re going to lose the election.” — Alana Abramson Former Vice President Joe Biden stumbled through yet another debate, erroneously claiming to have the backing of the only black woman elected to the Senate while sharing the stage with California Sen. Kamala Harris and pledged to fight for women’s right by “punching at it and punching at it and punching.” But the evening is unlikely to destroy his position in the top-tier of Democratic candidates. Part of the reason Biden has remained so durable despite cringe-inducing moments is that Democrats, more than anything, want someone who can trounce Trump next year. At this point, Biden remains a leading figure on that, in large part because of a deep well of support from older voters and African Americans. The experienced politician, who turned 77 on Wednesday, is widely seen as the best candidate to win back swing states that Trump carried in 2016 — although Harris returned several times to her ability to rebuild what she called the Obama Coalition and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar talked up her appeal to those swing voters, as well. At the same time, Biden drew fire from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker for his comments on marijuana policy and drug laws. Last weekend, Biden said he isn’t ready to legalize marijuana because there are so few medical studies on its long-term effects and said it could be a “gateway” drug to stronger drugs. (Biden says he supports the use of medical marijuana, would decriminalize the possession of marijuana and would allow the states to make decisions about marijuana’s recreational use.) Booker had a clever ding at the ready: “I thought you might have been high when you said it. … Marijuana has already been legal in our country for privileged people.” Biden flashed frustration at the attack and then calmed down. Worse has been said of him, and he’s still enjoying some of the broadest support in the Democratic field — at least for now. — Philip Elliott New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand dropped out of the Democratic primary in August, but it wasn’t until Wednesday night that one of her flagship proposals — paid family leave — got time on the debate stage. Although the vast majority of Americans support mandatory paid leave for new mothers, the U.S. is the only industrialized nation that doesn’t guarantee paid parental leave through a federal law. One in four women have to return to work within two weeks of delivering a baby, according to a 2015 analysis by non-profit magazine In These Times. The all-women panel of moderators broached the subject early in their questions. Entrepreneur Andrew Yang used the opportunity to talk about how a positive home life — including whether parents have enough time to spend with their kids — increases children’s success later in life. He suggested requiring employers offer “at least nine months of paid family leave, distributed between parents however they see fit; or six months of paid leave for a single parent.” Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose campaign has largely been defined by pragmatism, suggested a leaner offering. “My plan is three months, I think that’s good,” she said. “I’m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker, and then throw in a free car.” Though Warren, Sanders and Biden were not offered the opportunity to comment, Warren has advocated for a universal childcare policy with benefits based on a sliding scale and Sanders previously co-sponsored Gillibrand’s Senate bill to provide parents 12 weeks of paid leave. Biden’s campaign has not yet announced a paid family leave solution. — Abby Vesoulis Everyone expected South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg to spend much of his time on the defensive after a week of rising in the polls, but attacks from his competitors were surprisingly mild. Though his rivals have been grumbling about his steady rise, none of them went for the jugular when they criticized him on his failures to reach black voters or his lack of experience. Instead, Sen. Harris said “candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,” but declined to attack Buttigieg outright, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar cited her own long experience while briefly criticizing his lack of experience. Buttigieg was able to turn both moments into opportunities. When Harris alluded to his lack of support among black voters, he said “I completely agree” that his campaign has to do better, and used it as an opportunity to talk about inclusion and belonging. “While I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,” he said. And when Klobuchar said “I have actually done the work” in Washington while pointing out his relative lack of experience, he used it as a launchpad to portray himself as a Washington outsider. “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters,” he said. “There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?” Only Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard tried to land a full punch, when she attacked him for supposedly endorsing military intervention in Mexico, which he quickly and forcefully disputed. Overall, Buttigieg emerged largely unscathed, partly because his opponents took mostly veiled shots at him and partly because he was able to quickly own up to his shortcomings and use them as a way to tie into broader narratives about his candidacy. — Charlotte Alter While Sen. Harris avoided attacking Buttigieg directly over his campaign’s use of a stock photo of a Kenyan woman for his black outreach plan, she and Booker both used the evening to discuss their party’s outreach to black voters. “The larger issue is that for too long I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic party,” said Harris, one of the two black candidates on stage on Wednesday night. She went on to deride Democrats for only reaching out to black voters when they need their votes. “The question has to be, where you been, and what are you going to do?” Booker also made similar points, noting at one point that “black voters are pissed off” about Democrats not being there for them, pointedly saying Democrats shouldn’t need a focus group to hear from black voters. Booker, earlier in the day, had tweeted about the stock photograph. While Buttigieg is surging in Iowa and rising in New Hampshire, two early voting states, he has struggled in South Carolina, and with black voter outreach as a whole. In a recent South Carolina poll, he once again polled at 0% among black voters, his campaign has reportedly exaggerated support for his black outreach plan, in addition to the stock photo of a Kenyan woman. “I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don’t … know me,” Buttigieg said at the debate. He pointed to the adversity he has overcome as a gay man and how it helps him relate to other marginalized communities, “making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn’t have happened two election ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience.” — Lissandra Villa The divide between moderates and progressives has shaped a lot of the conversation both in the 2020 Democratic primary and in previous debates, but in Wednesday’s debate that divide was only an undercurrent. That was due in part to the questions asked of the candidates, but also because Warren and Sanders, the two leading progressive candidates, did not make it a priority to put other candidates on the defensive over their lack of support for some of their ideas. However, it was clear there is still a lot of balking about some of their proposals from moderates. “As I’ve said before, I’d love to staple free diplomas under people’s chairs. I just am not going to go for things … just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar alluding to some of the ideas progressives in the field have proposed (like free college). — Lissandra Villa Candidates sparred over how to address the America’s yawning income gap. The richest 1% of Americans now hold more wealth than the nation’s entire middle class, according to the Brookings Institution. But Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both self-described capitalists, disagreed over what to do about it. Warren has pledged to institute an “Ultra-Millionaire” 2% tax on individuals whose net worth is above $50 million and a 6% tax on those above $1 billion. During Wednesday’s debate, Warren argued that the roughly 75,000 households who are rich enough to be affected by her proposed tax didn’t achieve their success alone. “Doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. It’s about saying, ‘You built something great in this country? Good for you,’” the Massachusetts progressive said. “But you did it using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You’re getting your goods on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for.” Booker pushed against Warren’s calls to enact a formal wealth tax, arguing instead for other means of increasing tax revenue. “I don’t agree with the wealth tax, the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains,” he said. As the Democratic candidates’ platforms have shifted left, Booker may be trying to appeal to fellow capitalists who worry about the multi-trillion dollar plans — like free four-year college and erasing student debt nationwide — proposed by candidates like Warren and Sanders. Arguing that Americans should have both fair wages and equal opportunities to earn those wages could help Booker pick up some much-needed support from undecided and moderate Democrats as his campaign struggles to exceed 2-3% in national polls. “The people in communities I frequent, [their] aspiration is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities in opportunity,” Booker said. “And that’s what our party has to be about.” — Abby Vesoulis While the moderators devoted little time to climate change with only a couple of questions on the issue, candidates pivoted to the issue anyway — an indication that candidates not only recognize the issue’s urgency but also that their campaigns view the issue as winner with voters. Asked about military service, Warren talked about Americans serving their country by working on public lands to fight climate change. Asked about farm subsidies, Buttigieg talked about making climate-sensitive farms “as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car.” And Sanders managed to slip in a reference to climate change in response to a question about impeachment. There’s good reason for this pivot beyond the urgency of the challenge: voters care about climate. A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month that show climate change running neck and neck with the health care as the top issue in New Hampshire. And many earlier polls show the issue in a similar place in Iowa. — Justin Worland While the debate allowed candidates to talk about a wider range of topics than in the past, many viewers noted that the absence of former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former HUD Secretary Julián Castro highlighted a lack of discussion around some issues such as gun violence, immigration and how violence can affect people of color. O’Rourke dropped out of the 2020 race earlier this month and while Castro is still running for President, he did not meet the polling requirement to participate in this month’s debate, and has been struggling to raise funds despite continuing to put out progressive policy ideas. Castro drew attention on the debate stage back in June when he challenged his fellow Democrats to decriminalize illegal immigration, and has earned support from activists for speaking out about police violence, as well as advocating for reproductive justice and for disability rights. O’Rourke, who is from El Paso, Texas, which saw a mass shooting in August, made gun control a focus of his campaign and stirred controversy when he proposed a mandatory buy back of assault weapons. Despite not being on the debate stage, Castro spent his evening tweeting along, and some of his supporters noted that his ideas were now being taken up by other candidates, such as when Elizabeth Warren said she believed abortion rights “are economic rights.” But others such as Rep. Pramila Jayapal lamented that no one took up the immigration mantle in Castro’s absence, and Warren herself said “we should have talked about gun violence” in her closing statement, something that O’Rourke would have no doubt agreed with. — Abigail Abrams Contact us at letters@time.com.",2019-11-21 02:06:09,"Booker Rises, Biden Stays Afloat and Nobody Wants to Dwell on Impeachment. 10 Takeaways From the November Debate","politics and government,united states politics and government,elections,election issues",40362,http://www.time.com/time/

[+] Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) Pittsburgh enjoyed decades of beautiful days in the neighborhood when Fred Rogers was at WQED Studios creating the PBS series Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (1968-2001). A multitasker before it was fashionable, Rogers created the land of make-believe, chose the team behind it and took on the roles of host, head writer, musical composer and puppeteer. His presence in the steel city would leave those same threads of kindness and empathy that run through all 895 episodes of the show, the threads that wove Rogers into the fabric of so many lives. The filming and November 22 release of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood directed by Marielle Heller and starring Tom Hanks as Rogers and Matthew Rhys as Esquire journalist Tom Junod, has become nothing short of a family affair in Rogers’ adopted city of Pittsburgh thanks to the icon’s legacy and Heller’s inclusion of those people, places and things that helped Rogers set the stage of success for Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Rogers, who died in 2003, grew up in Latrobe, Pennsylvania a small town about an hour’s drive from Pittsburgh, but there is no denying that Rogers, who built the show and his family life with wife Joanne and their two sons in the city, laid down heavy roots there. Dawn Keezer, Director of the Pittsburgh Film Office, recently discussed with me the mutual collaboration between the city and the filmmakers which sounded rather Fred Rogers-like when it came to enthusiastic cooperation and genuine respect. Said Keezer, “What's interesting about A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is, you know, Mr. Rogers plays a very large part in it and being that Pittsburgh's his neighborhood…everyone here in the region seems to believe they're part of Mr. Rogers’ neighborhood too, which is a wonderful thing. And we all feel a real strong sense of ownership about this project and about this film. So what was nice about it is everybody was doing everything they possibly could to…make sure the film was actually made in Southwestern Pennsylvania and…to pull out all the stops to make sure that they could get the set pieces that they needed, that they got to film at WQED and the actual place where Mister Rogers was made. The Mister Rogers’ company (Fred Rogers Productions) let them come in and measure the actual tree and the actual— all the different set pieces themselves. They were able to interview and work with people who had actually worked on Mister Rogers at the time when they were recreating his show. So it was a real group effort. It was a real community effort and I think everyone's thrilled to be able to finally get to see the finished project…” While Pittsburgh was the logical choice for filming, Keezer notes that that the experience wasn’t without challenges. “This film was very stressful primarily because of the lack of film tax credits that were available to this project when they called us to say they wanted to come and film this movie in Southwestern PA. The film tax credits, which is an incentive program we've had at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania now for 14 years, is our main driver of getting business into the region. It is a global competition to get film business into different locations and our film tax credit program is woefully underfunded and oversubscribed. We always have far more work than we have funds.” Keezer says that while the film, should have been an immediate “slam dunk,” when it came to getting everything rolling, that first tax-driven piece was shaky. “It's Mister Rogers. It’s a great story. It's community-based. Everyone's going to know about it. This’ll be great. But without the film tax credits available, it made it much more of a challenge. That's when it took a real team effort, primarily led by Senator Jay Costa, to get us the funds needed, the incentive needed to keep this project in Pennsylvania. So once we got over that hurdle, the rest of it was pretty easy and we're excited.” Sadly, tax issues wouldn’t be the only challenge. The cast, crew and film community suffered a terrible loss on October 11, 2018 when Emmy Award-winning sound mixer James Emswiller died after an onset accident. The filming would continue, but hearts were heavy after the loss of a valued colleague whose professionalism was matched by his kindness. “He was always the guy I took people to when I took visitors to set, which I do very rarely. But when I bring an elected official, I knew I could bring them to Jim and he would tell them what was going on and he would do it in a way they could understand,” said Keezer. Never ones to hold back important opinions, the Pittsburgh community, including those who personally knew Rogers seem smitten with Hanks in the role of the icon. Said Keezer about the actor, “I think that it just sort of fit…And then when you see it, when you first saw the publicity stills, it's just like, ‘Wow, he embodied Mr. Rogers.’ And then he kept doing so many kind things in Pittsburgh. You know, he showed up for the Tree of Life Memorial [after the October 27, 2018 mass shooting]. He showed up for Get Out The Vote. He showed up for Pittsburgh.” Longtime friend and colleague David Newell, the actor who Rogers cast as speedy delivery man Mr. McFeely in 1968 and who continues to make special appearances on behalf of the show, concurred. “It’s perfect casting,” said Newell in a recent podcast interview before he headed off to an early film screening in Manhattan. “One day I was on the computer and I happened to come across a picture or a story about the film, and I looked up and I said, ‘Where did they get that picture of Fred? I've never seen that before.’ And here it was Tom Hanks…They had released the first image of Tom Hanks in his Mr. Rogers’ sweater and sneakers…I can't think of another actor who— I'm sure there are plenty of actors who could do the part, but not with the appeal that I think Tom Hanks has.” June 8, 1993: Fred Rogers, right, during a rehearsal with David Newell, a.k.a. Speedy Delivery's Mr. ... [+] McFeely, for a segment of his television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in Pittsburgh. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) In what feels like a beautiful nod to the relationship between Mister Rogers Neighborhood and the feature film, Newell and some of his former colleagues can be spotted in film cameos. Interestingly, the “speedy delivery” actor who also served in a PR role for the show way back when had another hand in the film. He was the guy who fielded questions and set up Rogers’ interviews, including the Esquire request from Junod in 1998. Newell doesn’t take any credit for the connection, but he does reflect on the friendship between Rogers and the reporter which wasn’t an unusual occurrence for Rogers who was all about relationship building. “Fred was the kind of person who would write notes and he wrote notes to people all the time and kept up these connections. He made a lot of good friends from interviews that he had had that he did over the years.” “He was such a kind person and it came out of who he was. It wasn't an act, you know, it wasn't just for television. It was, what you see is what you got with Fred Rogers.” A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is about a relationship beyond Pittsburgh, but during the filming it was about a relationship with Pittsburgh. And according to many of the players, everyone got along exactly as Mister Rogers would have hoped.

Mexico City claims the shopping center failed in providing necessary and reasonable security measures. A U.S. law firm hired by Mexico’s Consulate in El Paso filed the lawsuit on behalf of 10 Mexican nationals who were victims in the attack. On August 3, a lone gunman entered the Walmart near the Cielo Vista shopping center targeting what he called “Hispanic invaders” in a manifesto. The man killed 22 and injured 24 more. Texas prosecutors filed capital murder charges against the alleged shooter. “Through this lawsuit, the petitioners are seeking justice not only for them but also for safety for the public in general,” Mexico’s Foreign Relations Ministry said in a prepared statement after the filing of the lawsuit. “Mexico’s government will continue using all resources available to keep these types of incidents from happening and to repair the damages suffered by the victims.” Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The weapon was a ""kit gun"" with no serial numbers, and another kit gun was found at the family's home, Sheriff Alex Villanueva told television station KABC. It was unclear who assembled the gun. Weapons assembled at home, allowing owners to avoid registering them, are commonly called ghost guns. Villanueva said the suspect’s father, who died in 2017, at one point had six firearms registered to him, but those guns had been lawfully removed from the home and were legally destroyed. He was then considered a ""prohibited possessor"" who could not legally own a gun, but Villanueva did not say why. The 16-year-old shot five students in the quad area of Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, a city north of Los Angeles, on Nov. 14 before turning the weapon on himself, authorities said. He died the next day. A motive in the shooting has not been determined, Villanueva told the station. Authorities have been unable to unlock the teen's cellphone and were working with federal agencies to access it, he said. ""The why is still a mystery to this date,"" he said. Villanueva has called the shooting a ""planned attack."" The student, Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow, was dropped off at school by his mother that day and he pulled the handgun from a backpack before opening fire, officials have said. Download the NBC News app for breaking news Gracie Muehlberger, 16, and Dominic Blackwell, 14, were killed. NBC News had reported that officials were looking at whether the handgun used was a “ghost gun.” That the weapon used was manufactured from parts was also confirmed by Carlos A. Canino, the special agent in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Los Angeles field office. Villanueva told KABC that gun kits, which involve a weapon 80 percent already completed, with the remaining 20 percent to be assembled at home, are legal to buy, but they can allow people to escape registering them. ""That is very dangerous,"" the sheriff said. California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. In 2016, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill into law that required the owners of ghost guns to apply for serial numbers in the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom in October signed a bill into law that would require firearm precursor parts used to assemble ghost guns to be sold by licensed dealers and requiring a background check. The law does not take effect until 2024. In Southern California, federal authorities say one-third of all the firearms seized are ghost guns, The Associated Press reported. Self-assembled firearms have been used in other shootings in California, including a 2017 mass shooting in Rancho Tehama Reserve in Northern California that killed four people and injured 10 others. Read the school shooting tracker article, and read how NBC News counts a school shooting. In August, a semi-automatic assault-style rifle used by a gunman to shoot three California Highway Patrol officers in the Los Angeles area was a homemade ghost gun, law enforcement officials said. The shooter opened fire after being stopped in Riverside and after an officer was preparing to have his vehicle impounded. CHP Officer Andre Moye Jr. was killed, and the gunman was shot dead by law enforcement officers. Andrew Blankstein is an investigative reporter for NBC News.

304,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/movies/mr-rogers-message-kindness-empathy-needed-more-ever-n1088796?cid=public-rss_20191122," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News In this era of partisan divisions, Joanne Rogers often laments how much this generation of children could use the kindness radiated by her late husband. ""I’ve never known it in my life to be like this (time period),"" she told NBC News ahead of the Thursday release of ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."" ""One of the most important things to Fred was reconciliation. I think he would be appalled,"" she says of the political discourse of this era. ""I am appalled."" So, it's no coincidence that ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" — inspired by the true story behind Tom Junod's 1998 Esquire cover profile on children's television icon Fred Rogers, and the salve the experience had on the journalist's own fractured family life — is coming out now at a time when a majority of Americans are angry at the country's political establishment and pessimistic about its future. ""When Peter Saraf, one of the producers, sent the script to me, it made me weep,"" director Marielle Heller said. ""It felt so important and it felt like something I wanted to spend my time doing and I could feel like I’m putting something good out into the world by making this movie."" ""It feels like everyone is saying to me, 'Oh my gosh, it feels like we need Mr. Rogers more than ever.' We’re living in scary times and I think we all have that feeling that we’re losing touch with each other and we’re losing touch with the ability to listen to each other and empathize with each other."" And right now there doesn't seem to be an obvious heir. Nearly 900 episodes of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"" ran on National Education Television (which later became the Public Broadcasting Service) from 1968 to 2001. The show's host used puppets, songs and an endless supply of empathy to help kids through tough issues, including death and divorce. Rogers dipped his toe into the civil rights movement in a 1969 episode that featured him cooling off his feet in a wading pool with the black actor François Clemmons, who played a police officer. That was a breach of a major color barrier at a time when many swimming pools across the country were still segregated along racial lines. It's hard to imagine for those brought up on endless streaming options and social media, but during a time when there was a true national television audience, Rogers was as respected by a generation of children as newscasters Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw were by their parents. Joanne Rogers believes that the message is still potent for a generation of young children who are learning mass shooting safety drills in kindergarten, and hopes that parents who grew up with the show are introducing it to their own kids through reruns. ""Little children from 2 to 5 — Fred Rogers' audience — aren’t going to be thinking of partisan politics, they aren’t going to be users of social media at that age, they’re too little,"" said Sandra Calvert, a professor of psychology at Georgetown University, who researches children's interaction with media. ""What their parents are looking for them at that age is for first cognitive experiences that are going to give them a foundation to succeed in their lives."" ""Teaching children at young ages about values of kindness, and empathy and caring for others, is something as a culture would make us flourish if we spent more time doing that,"" she added. Rogers, an ordained Presbyterian minister, preached love; and, as his wife puts it, ""the show was Fred's ministry."" That message may now seem as quaintly antiquated as Rogers' method of looking at the camera to engage the television audience, in what Calvert calls a ""parasocial"" relationship — the host couldn't have known to whom he was speaking on the other side of the screen, but made those viewers feel he did. There was also his patented slow, methodic delivery. ""That style was able to thrive at a time when the rest of television was speeding up, as exemplified by the much faster and flashier 'Sesame Street,'"" said Robert Thompson, professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. ""There was this sense of timelessness with 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.' The older you get, the more you long for a Mr. Rogers. Nobody else has had that selfless, calm and zen-like peace in them,"" Thompson said. There was only one person that Heller could picture donning the red cardigan sweater of the children's television icon — Tom Hanks, a regular fixture atop polls of the most trusted Americans and, as Ancestry.com ferreted out, a distant cousin of Rogers himself. ""There are few people we feel as warmly towards as Tom Hanks,"" Heller said. ""And he represents some part of our heart that feels similar to how we feel towards Mr. Rogers. And there’s almost nobody else I can think of who we feel that way about."" In fact, during Joanne Rogers' interview with NBC News at Sunday's press junket for the film in New York City, the actor bounded into the room to give the 89-year-old woman a neighborly hug. Those who knew him swear Fred Rogers, who died of stomach cancer in 2003, was every bit the kind-hearted soul he came across as on television. That didn't mean he didn't feel frustration or anger: His wife likes to tell a story about a time when her stressed husband decided he needed to see an ocean wave — not something readily available near their Pittsburgh home. After a two-hour drive to the shore of Lake Erie, he arrived to find no waves, but just knowing that he tried, soothed him. ""Joanne said something so profound to me, which we added almost verbatim in the movie,"" Heller said. ""She said, 'Listen, it’s important for you to know that he was not a saint. Because if you think of him as a saint, then his message is unattainable.' ""When she said that to me, it clicked for me ... all of us could be kind. The person who takes the mantle, the person to pass the torch to, was all of us.""

305,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/22/crossroads-of-the-west-inside-the-last-gun-show-in-san-francisco,"The Cow Palace arena has announced it would discontinue the event on the property beginning 1 January 2020 Last modified on Thu 17 Dec 2020 14.32 GMT Paul Stamp has been selling “country foods” – beef jerky, dried fruit, roasted nuts – alongside gun holsters and firearm ammunition for about 30 years. As a longtime vendor at the San Francisco Bay Area’s Crossroads of the West gun show he’s come to see similar faces, and even considers some of his customers to be family. However, last week’s gun show will likely be the last time Stamp sees this particular clientele. In April of this year, the board of directors for the Cow Palace arena, the longtime venue of the gun show in Daly City, announced it would discontinue gun shows at the property. In their monthly meeting, the nine-person body voted to uphold the prohibition which will take effect on 1 January 2020.  Inside the last Cow Palace gun show on the 16 November weekend, attendees walked around in newly-purchased bulletproof vests, peered through rifle scopes, and chewed on samples of Stamp’s beef jerky. The crowd primarily consisted of middle-aged and older white men, many of whom were sporting T-shirts signifying their reverence for the United States military and the police. Since California laws disallow anyone from leaving the show with a fully functional firearm, most people left without an actual gun. Instead people purchased gun parts, hunting equipment and self-defense items. The lack of functional firearms was a departure from the firearm-heavy gun show that 20-year-old Ricardo Moreira is used to. He lived in Arizona for five years and says that this was his first time at the Cow Palace gun show, which he describes as “smaller, and more toned down”. “There’s not much to see,” said Moreira, who brought four of his friends. “For a gun show you’d think there would be a lot of guns. Here there are more attachments, backpacks, and knives. There were some guns, but they were old ones.” Upon learning that that weekend’s gun show may be their first and last, Moreira’s posse seemed mostly unfazed. Unlike Moreira, who says he has been shooting for sport since he was a teen, his friend said they weren’t interested in carrying guns, and Saturday’s show was merely a fun group outing. “It’s kind of sad that it’s not out here anymore, but it’s San Francisco,” said 19-year-old Taylor Benson who purchased a stun gun and knife from one of the vendors. For Paul Stamps, the ban mostly amounts to political fodder – he maintains that his customers and other gun show attendees are responsible sportsmen and women, not public safety hazards. “There has not been one incident at these gun shows,” Stamps says. “These guys obey the laws. They’re hunters and sportsmen, not the wild-eyed people that you see on TV.” “I know why people are tense but I think officials are making political hay out of it,” he added. “People make a career out of opposing gun shows. People on the other side make a political career defending gun shows, it’s just politics.” Officials hope that bans on gun shows can make it more difficult for people to get guns, and lead to a decrease in gun violence. In the past month, five shootings in California have become national news including a school shooting in Santa Clarita and a mass shooting at a Halloween party in Orinda, a small city just outside Oakland. In October, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that enacts a ban similar to that at the Cow Palace for the Del Mar fairgrounds in San Diego county. And some are hoping to continue to expand these policies to more of California’s state-run venues. “For me this is a taxpayer’s rights issue,” Dave Min, a state senate hopeful, told the Guardian this week. “These family-friendly venues are funded and owned by the taxpayer. I have a philosophical problem with my tax dollars being used to make it easier to have guns in our society.” Min is currently a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and after back-to-back mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas he announced an initiative to ban gun shows at the Orange County Fair and Event Center in Costa Mesa, California. Min acknowledged that this ban won’t completely end gun violence, but believes it’s a necessary public policy that can keep firearms away from potentially dangerous people. “We have to start one step at a time. This is a small step, but it is a step forward,” Min says.

The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list School lockdown drills and exercises are controversial today, due in large part to some troubling examples making headlines. Teachers in Monticello, Indiana, for example, were hurt when they got shot in the back with plastic pellets. Students in Franklin, Ohio, were exposed to sounds of simulated gunfire. Sometimes, role-playing kids and teens, covered in fake blood, are scattered throughout their schools – screaming. Parents who fear that these experiences could be traumatizing their children are objecting and calling for schools to stop holding them. Rather than reduce the harm caused during mass shootings, they say, dramatic approaches cause harm by amplifying students’ fears about the danger of being shot at school. This raises a good question I seek to answer through my research: Is it possible to be prepared without being scared?  Today, more than 95% of public schools conduct lockdown drills. They became considerably more commonplace and focused on active attacker situations after the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School, in which 12 students and a teacher were murdered. But U.S. schools have held emergency preparedness drills for decades. In the 1950s, they practiced duck-and-cover drills in preparedness for the atomic attacks Americans feared would occur during the Cold War. Fire drills became commonplace in schools after 1958. A student in a Chicago parochial school in that year started a fire in the building’s boiler room, killing 93 students and two teachers. Across the nation, students, faculty and staff participate in drills to prepare for earthquakes and tornadoes without hesitation or second thoughts. They have become routine. So why is resistance to lockdown drills apparently on the rise? There are two key reasons why there is such an aversion to lockdown drills. The first comes from a muddling of two things that are related but not the same: exercises and drills. Exercises incorporate realistic sights and sounds, such as the simulated screaming and bleeding that might occur during a mass shooting. Drills, on the other hand, only require practice, such as evacuating a building or locking doors and getting as many people as possible out of sight. During fire drills, for example, nobody sets schools on fire to make them seem more realistic. Instead, everyone practices how to respond so that it’s easier to do the right thing in a frightening situation. Exercises and drills are often talked about as if they are the same. But they are different, a point that often is lost in the call to end the practices associated with both of them that are often perceived as traumatic. A second reason that lockdown drills are misunderstood is the lack of available research. Anecdotes about the impact of lockdown drills are everywhere. Evidence, however, is scarce. In fact, to date, just one study published in an academic journal has examined the effects of a lockdown drill on students. In 2007, psychologists Elizabeth Zhe and Amanda Nickerson found that when conducted in accordance with best practices, drills can increase awareness of how to respond to a situation without increasing anxiety or making people feel less safe. These best practices for lockdown drills, according to the National Association of School Psychologists and others, do not include simulation exercises that involve fake blood and screams. Participants should know that they’re experiencing a drill, rather than a real situation, to minimize the possibility of trauma. Mental health professionals should be involved in the planning and carrying out of drills. And these exercises should be appropriate both for the ages involved and for special needs such as prior traumatic experiences. Also, teachers and staff should always talk with students afterward to answer any questions they may have. Lockdown exercises have become more elaborate since the 2007 study was conducted. Drills have remained largely the same. Lockdown drills, like fire drills, are intended to help people respond correctly in emergency situations by making them practice. Along with training, having clearly defined objectives is critical to success. Students must be taught what they are expected to do and why they are expected to do it. The team I head has found that training helps make everyone feel better prepared. Building confidence enhances the ability to do what’s needed during an emergency, our research indicates. Schools typically have three clearly defined goals during lockdown drills: lock the doors, turn off the lights and remain silent and out of view of anyone in the hallway. In real life, situations that would result in a lockdown being called — such as an armed attacker on school grounds — usually end within minutes. Locking doors slows down assailants, giving first responders more time to stop them. Turning lights off makes it harder for an attacker to find their targets, as does remaining out of sight and staying quiet. Another commonly taught strategy is “Run, Hide, Fight,” introduced as a collaboration between the Houston Police Department and the Department of Homeland Security several years after the Columbine shooting. That plan instructs kids to run and escape the building, hide if that is not an option, and fight back as a last resort. But critics argue that Run, Hide, Fight is not necessarily the best practice for schools. They say that running makes sense only when locking down isn’t an option, such as when someone gets stranded in a common area or hallway. And most school security experts discourage fighting attackers, as most people aren’t trained in self-defense, especially against armed assailants. Each emergency situation is different. Each has unique circumstances that dictate the right response. This is why training is so important: It empowers students, teachers and others to make critical decisions in a crisis. I can speak about this issue not just from my professional observations but based on my own perspective. I grew up in the Parkland, Florida, area where an armed former student entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day in 2018, killing 17 people and wounding 17 others. The lack of training for how to respond during active-shooter situations left everyone in the building vulnerable, according to an official investigation. Despite the fact that school shootings have become a matter of grave public concern over the past two decades, public schools remain among the safest places for children to be and mass shootings at schools are rare. Yet they do occur. I believe that kids should be prepared, but also that drills do not have to be scary to be effective. Schools can take steps to minimize the anxiety and trauma surrounding lockdown drills. While I don’t recommend exercises featuring plastic pellets and fake blood, the evidence available indicates that practicing what to do when an emergency arises is worthwhile.

But can Democrats wrest control from the GOP? Reporter Illustration by Victor Juhasz for Rolling Stone The fight to dislodge Donald Trump from the presidency has sparked unprecedented interest in the 2020 Democratic primary, drawing dozens of candidates, including no fewer than seven sitting senators. But the fight to wrest the Senate from Republican control — and oust Mitch McConnell as majority leader — is arguably just as important. Take it from Amy McGrath, the former Marine fighter pilot aiming to win McConnell’s Kentucky Senate seat, who sees curbing McConnell’s power as essential to healing our republic. “He’s the epitome of Washington dysfunction, everything we hate about politics,” she says. “You cannot drain the swamp until you get rid of Mitch McConnell.” Related

						20 Worst 'Saturday Night Live' Hosts The stakes could hardly be higher. Unless Democrats flip the Senate, the grand plans of the presidential candidates are dead on arrival. Capturing the chamber is just as crucial if Trump is re-elected; it would give Democrats control of the legislative agenda, budget, and judicial confirmations, ending McConnell’s reign as Trump’s rubber stamp. “I’m not sure McConnell sees the Congress anymore as an independent branch of government,” says Sen. Doug Jones, an Alabama Democrat, “but simply to be there for the president.”  Republicans currently hold a three-seat edge in the Senate, 53 to 47. At first glance, the 2020 electoral map looks favorable to Democrats. Republicans must defend 23 seats to the Democrats’ 12. But the terrain is challenging: 20 of the GOP incumbents hail from states Trump carried in 2016. Still, nonpartisan analysts like Democratic chances. “The Senate’s in play,” says Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections, which handicaps federal races. “Democrats have enough takeover opportunities to get there without having to win everything on the table.” The path to a Democratic majority will be shaped by political dynamics that the candidates can’t fully control — including the tumult of Trump’s possible impeachment and the strength of the Democrats’ 2020 presidential nominee. In 2016, every Senate contest went in the direction of the presidential vote. Concerning some political watchers is the gap between the agenda of Democratic front-runners like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — who are promising a wealth tax, free college, and a Green New Deal — and the Democratic Party’s favored Senate candidates, who are running as reformers, not revolutionaries, reflecting the pragmatic, donor-friendly ideology of the Senate’s top recruiter, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Republicans hope to weaponize this dissonance. “Democrats are going to have a hard time navigating the top of the ticket,” says a GOP strategist close to the Senate fight. Republicans are also counting themselves lucky it isn’t worse. Democrats failed to land several recruits who could have turned their states into toss-ups — including former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Gov. Steve Bullock in Montana. “We’re very happy with the field,” insists Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. “The biggest challenge Chuck and I had was that we had good choices.” A dozen races will be vital in determining control of the Senate, including two seats where Democrats must play defense, and 10 pickup opportunities, presented below in rough order of their likelihood of flipping. “We’ve got a good shot at this,” says Cortez Masto, running through the math for Senate control, with and without a Democratic vice president’s tiebreaking vote. “If we take the White House, we need three seats; if we don’t, we need four. I’m confident we have more than that.”   THE DEMOCRATIC battle plan begins with holding home turf. “We’re going to protect our incumbents,” vows Cortez Masto. That fight begins in Michigan, where Republican John James — a 38-year-old African American businessman and former Apache helicopter pilot — is gunning for Sen. Gary Peters. James out-raised Peters by nearly $500,000 in the third quarter, and a recent poll put him just three points behind the incumbent. Touted as a GOP rising star, James came within six points of unseating Sen. Debbie Stabenow in 2018, and Senate watchers see Peters as vulnerable. “He’s not a terribly charismatic guy,” says Jennifer Duffy, who handicaps the Senate for the Cook Political Report. “Voters don’t dislike him — they don’t know who he is.” Trump won Michigan by just 11,000 votes, and polls show him in danger of losing the state by double digits in 2020. James, who has Trump’s endorsement, has tried to distance himself from the president, telling voters, “A vote for me is a vote for me.” Alabama — a state Trump won by 28 points — is the greater challenge. In a 2017 special election, Doug Jones upset Roy Moore, a twice-defrocked state Supreme Court justice who also stood accused of sexually assaulting underage girls as a younger man (which he denied). “Jones ran a terrific campaign,” Duffy says, “but he also got the weakest general-election opponent Republicans could have possibly put up.” Jones has $5 million in the bank, out-raising a scrum of Republican contenders. Former Sen. Jeff Sessions scrambled that field earlier this month by declaring a new bid for his old seat (which he had given up to become Trump’s first attorney general). Jones’ approval rating is positive — 41 percent, versus 36 disapproving — buoyed by his relentless schedule of town halls. He pitches himself as a bulwark against the Democrats’ most ambitious policy goals, such as Medicare for All. “That’s the advantage of having a Democrat from the South,” he tells Rolling Stone, “to make sure there’s a voice from within that party to say, ‘Let’s hold off a little bit. There are other alternatives we need to look at.’ ”  Publicly, Republicans are counting Alabama in the win column. “Doug Jones is a dead man walking,” says the GOP strategist. But holding Alabama is not essential to flipping the Senate. “Democrats can lose Doug Jones,” Gonzales says, “and still have a path to victory.”  ON OFFENSE, Democrats are targeting seven races in traditional and emerging swing states. As many as four are already rated as toss-ups, while the others lean Republican but are still expected to be competitive. Colorado is trending blue, endangering GOP incumbent Cory Gardner, 45, who won by less than two points in 2014. Hillary Clinton took the state by five points, and Democrat Jared Polis soared to a 10-point victory in 2018, becoming the country’s first openly gay governor. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper, who ditched his humbling 2020 presidential run in August, tells Rolling Stone he’s approaching this Senate race with “pure, unbridled passion.” Hickenlooper remains broadly popular for guiding Colorado to an economic boom and passing strong gun-safety laws. Gardner, a longtime favorite of the National Rifle Association, has morphed from a Never Trumper into a Trump loyalist — a questionable choice when Trump’s Colorado disapproval rating stands at 56 percent. Even so, Gardner is not pleasing the base — he scores less than 50 percent approval with Republicans — and his decision to back the president’s emergency declaration at the border even prompted the right-leaning Denver Post to revoke its 2014 endorsement: “We see now that was a mistake.” In just the first six weeks of his Senate bid, Hickenlooper raised more than $2 million, nearly matching Gardner’s haul for the entire third quarter. An August poll showed Hickenlooper up by 13 points, but he expects a battle: “We’ll be attacked coming and going, and not just by the NRA,” he says. “We don’t, for one second, underestimate how much work is going to be involved to win this seat.” Arizona pits another Democratic star recruit — 55-year-old former NASA commander Mark Kelly — against incumbent Sen. Martha McSally, 53, a retired Air Force colonel. In 2018, Democrat Sen. Kirsten Sinema edged out McSally by two points, but McSally ended up joining the Senate anyway after being tapped by the state’s Republican governor to fill the late Sen. John McCain’s seat.  McSally has voted with Trump 96 percent of the time. And Trump, whose disapproval is 54 percent in Arizona, offered McSally the mixed blessing of his “Complete and Total Endorsement!” Her approval rate is just 39 percent — and she’s drawn a wealthy far-right primary challenger. That contest could force her into the same straddle that doomed her 2018 bid: trying to appease the Trump base while not alienating swing voters in the Phoenix suburbs. Kelly, who is the husband of Gabby Giffords — the former House member who was nearly assassinated in a mass shooting in 2011 — launched his campaign in February, and has out-raised McSally for three straight quarters, most recently by $2.5 million. “It’s stunning how much money he’s raising,” says Duffy. And an October poll put Kelly up by five among Arizona independents. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is one of several Republicans who are vulnerable in 2020. She has taken heat for supporting controversial Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh, and her approval number has dropped to 43 percent. Photo credit: Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times/Redux Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times/Redux North Carolina leans less blue than Colorado, but Sen. Thom Tillis finds himself in the same fix as Gardner. “He pleases nobody,” says Duffy. “Conservatives aren’t happy with him. Democrats aren’t happy with him.” In February, he published a Washington Post op-ed opposing the “executive overreach” of Trump’s emergency declaration to build the Wall. But just weeks later, Tillis voted to steer military funds to the border. “He capitulated to the president,” says Cal Cunningham, front-runner for the Democratic nomination. “When it is a choice between representing our state and taking care of his own political interests, he puts his own political interests first.” Tillis has a primary challenge on his right from millionaire businessman Garland Tucker, who touts himself as a conservative with “backbone.” So Tillis is spending large on TV ads tying himself to Trump — a political gift to Cunningham, a former state senator and decorated military lawyer. Cunningham has matched Tillis in fundraising, and a September poll had him leading the incumbent by two points. The Supreme Court appointment of Brett Kavanaugh is front-and-center in Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins is facing a backlash for her vote to install the anti-abortion jurist on the high court, despite allegations that he sexually assaulted women during his prep-school and college days. (Kavanaugh denied wrongdoing.)  Collins, 66, is a formidable incumbent, last elected with two-thirds of the vote. But Maine is trending blue; it voted for Clinton by three points, and elected a Democratic governor in a romp in 2018. The DSCC’s favored candidate is Sara Gideon, the speaker of Maine’s House, whose record includes forging a coalition with GOP rivals to tackle the opioid crisis. Gideon is out-raising Collins — by $1.1 million in the third quarter. And Collins’ approval numbers are currently underwater, at only 43 percent. On the surface, Iowa looks less promising as a pickup target: Trump won the state by 10 points. But the president is now polling with just 43 percent approval, and incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst is polling even worse, at 39 percent. Ernst was a Tea Party phenom in 2014 who touted her farm-girl past as a hog castrator and promised spending cuts to make Washington “squeal.” But Ernst has shown no maverick streak in D.C., instead becoming part of McConnell’s leadership team, helping to create trillion-dollar annual deficits. Theresa Greenfield, the DSCC’s favored recruit, is out-raising Ernst, who failed to clear $1 million in her opening quarter. The daughter of a crop-duster, Greenfield lost her husband to a work accident when she was 24 and a young mother. She vows to protect the social safety net, which she calls “bedrock agreements we’ve made, as Americans, to take care of each other.” Greenfield has never run for office but doesn’t lack for confidence, telling Rolling Stone, “I’m going to win this race.” Georgia is the toughest state to predict. Both Senate seats are up for grabs: GOP incumbent David Perdue is defending his seat, and ailing fellow Republican Johnny Isakson is stepping down at the end of the year — creating a special election. While Georgia parallels Arizona’s transition from red to purple, with the booming Atlanta suburbs driving the shift, the opportunity for Democrats is muted by the lack of an all-star recruit. The Democratic front-runner for the Perdue seat is 32-year-old Jon Ossoff, who earned a national profile while losing a $30 million special-election House battle in 2017. Perdue remains firmly in Trump’s corner and is fairly popular in the state. Ossoff’s late entry into the contest in September makes a direct fundraising comparison difficult.  For the special election, Gov. Brian Kemp will name Isakson’s interim replacement at the start of 2020, giving that candidate a leg up. Matt Lieberman — the son of longtime Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — has declared for the contest on the Democratic side. Under strange special-election rules, candidates from both parties will compete in a “jungle primary” on the night of the presidential election in 2020. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will ensue in January 2021 — conceivably with control of the Senate on the line.  THERE ARE A LOT of X factors in an election with Trump on the ticket, but Democrats are feeling confident enough to press their luck in deep-red states. “We’re going to come out strong,” says Cortez Masto, “and be on the offense.” In Kansas, an open Senate seat could flip if Republicans nominate Kris Kobach, an anti-immigrant zealot who lost the 2018 race for governor by five points. A DSCC source underscores that politicians like Kobach and Roy Moore have long bedeviled the GOP: “They’ve got unelectable candidates who have a proven record of winning statewide primaries.” A September poll showed Kobach at a 10-point deficit in a general-election matchup, and Democrats have since landed a star recruit in state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former Republican who broke with the party over the disastrous austerity economics of former Gov. Sam Brownback. “If Republicans nominate Kris Kobach,” says Gonzales, “that might be a better takeover opportunity than Georgia.” Gonzales also sees Democratic opportunity in the Lone Star State. “Republicans can’t take Texas for granted,” he says. Incumbent John Cornyn does not polarize voters as Ted Cruz did in 2018, when the Republican eked out a victory over Beto O’Rourke. But Democrat M.J. Hegar — who narrowly lost a House seat last year — believes she can compete by painting “Big John,” who served until January as the number-two Senate Republican, as McConnell’s “Lurch,” the manservant from The Addams Family. An Air Force veteran with a Purple Heart who crusaded to open military combat roles for women, Hegar is bold where Cornyn is bland, sporting shoulder tattoos and riding a Harley in slick campaign ads.  But for progressives in 2020, Mitch McConnell’s seat in Kentucky is the holy grail. Trump took the state by 30 points in 2016, but a Democrat claimed victory in the governor’s race in November. The senator’s approval rating in the state — 33 percent — is nearly as bad as defeated incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin’s. McConnell’s opponent, retired Lt. Col. Amy McGrath, a former F/A-18 fighter pilot, is fresh off a competitive 2018 House race and raising money like a presidential candidate — $10.7 million in the third quarter. McGrath is casting McConnell as a creature of Washington, bought by special interests, who has “turned his back on the people of Kentucky” and failed to deliver on bread-and-butter issues from infrastructure to the opioid crisis. “The guy’s been around 34 years,” she tells Rolling Stone. “If he cared about this stuff, something would have been done already.” McConnell runs strong campaigns and won’t lack for resources, but in a recent survey he was up by just one point, within the margin of error. One pernicious side effect of McConnell’s tenure has been turning the Senate into a terrible place for ambitious politicians to get things done. A key reason many prospective candidates are sour on Senate service is that McConnell has deformed what was long “the world’s greatest deliberative body” into what Cortez Masto laments as “a legislative graveyard.” McConnell has failed to take up more than 250 bills passed by House Democrats. And Jones blames the majority leader for squandering productive across-the-aisle partnerships. “There’s a lot more bipartisanship that goes on in the United States Senate than people see in the dueling press conferences, political speeches, and the Twitter wars going on,” Jones says. “If we could just get a floor vote and let the chips fall where they may, people would have a lot more confidence in the functions of Washington, D.C. But McConnell controls the floor.” Laying out the stakes of the 2020 election in simple terms, Cortez Masto adds, “It’s time to change that.” In This Article:

But in the small Idaho town of Sandpoint, Second Amendment activists are fortifying the rights they say are constitutionally theirs — no matter the cost. By
      
        Anne Helen Petersen Posted on November 22, 2019, at 11:15 a.m. ET Getting to Sandpoint — a small vacation town just an hour south of the Canadian border, in the Idaho panhandle — means taking the “Long Bridge” over Lake Pend Oreille, a sprawling body of water French trappers named for its resemblance to an earring, or at least an ear. The bridge is two miles long and offers a breathtaking panorama of the Selkirk, Bitterroot, and Cabinet mountain ranges, blanketed in national forest, standing sentinel in the background. In good weather, the lake feels endless and bottomless, a reflection of a season that feels like it’ll never end. In bad, the wind whipping off feels like a curse. To be on the Long Bridge when a train comes through on the adjacent rail bridge — which it does, several times every day and night — is to feel transported to a different decade, if not century. It all feels precarious and pristine, secret and special. Most everyone who moves to Sandpoint, population 8,700 — or the surrounding area of Bonner County, population just under 45,000 — has a “Long Bridge story”: what it felt like to drive across it for the first time, and the incredible urge to make some part of that place their own. Which is to say that Bonner County, like the rest of Idaho, is filled with transplants, especially from California, with more coming every day. Some come north over the Long Bridge and are drawn to Sandpoint’s quaint downtown, anchored by an old grain elevator that’s been turned into a climbing gym. There’s a community-run theater, restored to its 1927 glory, and a smattering of brewpubs and coffee shops, offering Indian food and acai bowls. It’s Main Street USA, only with better skiing and more shops selling puffy jackets. Some of these people are retirees, who might have arrived 30 years ago or last month; others are young families in search of a small-town, outdoors-oriented life. And most of them, at least the ones who choose to live in town, are pretty liberal. In 2016, both precincts that make up the town voted for Clinton; this past election, the town reelected its liberal mayor. Others are drawn to massive parcels of land miles out of town, still cheap enough to build your own compound and isolated enough that no one can hear you scream. Or, more charitably, where you can live out the dream of not even needing to tell anyone to mind their own business, at least in the vicinity of your property. The property taxes are low, and the regulations — at least compared to California — are basically nonexistent. On-grid or off, you can dig in and prepare your family for TEOTWAWKI (the end of the world as we know it), whether it’s sparked by political revolution or climate catastrophe. And most of these people, outside of city limits, are some mix of libertarian, constitutionalist, and far-right conservative. Downtown Sandpoint, Idaho It’s this conservative influx of people that has earned the area — along with Eastern Washington, Eastern Oregon, Montana, and Wyoming — the moniker of the “American Redoubt,” a term that’s ultimately more descriptive of a sensibility, and a state of mind, than an actual location. One’s embrace of that state of mind can land anywhere from extreme prepping and John Birchism to simply having a big house with acreage and a ""Don’t Tread on Me"" flag. Many Redoubt residents are evangelical or fundamentalist Catholic; some are Mormon, or atheist, or just don’t think it’s any of your business what or who they believe in. The Redoubt is no monolith. There are myriad political and philosophical disagreements among those who broadly share the lifestyle in the region; many even reject the name altogether. But the one thing they can all agree on — and the thing they moved to Idaho, at least in part, to see protected — is their interpretation of the Second Amendment. That understanding, based on conversations with people across the region over the past three years, is that American citizens should be able to possess any type of gun, and any number of guns, at any time. They should be able to carry those guns in whatever public space they want without question and without hassle. And they should be able to do so because, to their minds, it is a fundamental guarantee of the Constitution: the right to bear arms, the right to protect one’s self and one’s family. Some of these “liberty-minded” conservatives, as many call themselves, believe that citizens should have access not just to AR-15s, but fully automatic weapons as well. Bonner County Sheriff Daryl Wheeler migrated to the area from California in 1998. “I’ve been here 21 years,” he told me, “and about a year ago, they told me I’ve been here long enough to have an opinion.” With a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor and a thick, graying mustache, he resembles a sheriff from a video game. “We’re different up here,” Wheeler said. “We are really different. This is what we do. This is our lifestyle. This is our right. To take away that right is to revoke someone’s citizenship and a building block of America and liberty.” In 2016, Idaho joined 15 other states in allowing “constitutional carry,” a term adopted by gun rights advocates to describe the ability to legally carry a firearm, openly or concealed, without a permit or training. The term first came into use in 2010, as the tea party and other far-right conservatives rallied around the perceived threat of Obama administration “coming for our guns.” Unlike “permitless carry,” the term “constitutional carry” suggests that its advocates aren’t asking for anything novel or unreasonable. They simply want their constitutional rights. When originally passed in the state of Idaho, constitutional carry was limited to those over the age of 21; earlier this year, that age was lowered to 18. And they’ve fended off repeated attempts to introduce universal background checks, institute red flag laws, and ban assault-style weapons. Depending on your political persuasion and current location, this might seem counterintuitive. One might expect the rash of mass shootings that now punctuate American life to decrease, rather than increase, the desire for ready access to guns in public places. But for millions of Americans, there’s a different calculus at work: Mass shootings mean that public spaces are more dangerous, which, to them, means an urgent need to protect themselves and their families — with guns. What’s more, gun rights advocates believe the emotions around the mass shootings make it all the more likely that Second Amendment rights will be curtailed by anti-gun, anti-NRA legislators — like those who recently flipped the Virginia legislature blue, ushered into office by voters they see as irrational suburbanites. All the more reason, advocates say, to protect and codify those rights at all costs. This summer, the tension between the move to curtail access to firearms in public spaces and the demand to protect that access once again came to a head. After yet another string of mass shootings — including one at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August — lawmakers again refused or were stymied in their attempts to pass additional gun control legislation. But a number of corporations decided to act in their stead. Back in February 2018, Dick’s Sporting Goods had announced it would no longer sell assault-style weapons and raised the age of purchase of all other guns to 21. This September, Walmart discontinued handgun and assault-style ammunition sales, and officially discouraged customers from bringing firearms into stores. A slew of chains — including Kroger, CVS, Walgreens, Wegmans, and Albertsons — announced similar policies. The private sector was attempting to change, in however haphazard a way, what publicly elected officials could or would not. It was against this backdrop that Jeff Avery, a member of the Oath Keepers, and Scott Herndon, who’s known in Bonner County for his aggressive anti-abortion activism, decided to enter an Avett Brothers concert in August while carrying firearms — and filmed themselves being turned away. The concert was part of the Festival at Sandpoint, a 36-year-old institution that draws more than 25,000 attendees a year, infusing an estimated $1.8 million into the local economy every year. And, in accordance with several performer contracts, it had banned guns from the premises. If the festival had been held in someone’s field, a privately owned winery, or an arena, that would’ve been fine — private property means you can make whatever rules you want about guns. But the festival has always been held at War Memorial Field, a public park leased from the city. And Idaho law protects the right to carry guns in public. The city of Sandpoint claimed the matter was out of its hands. The festival organizers claim that if they’re forced to allow firearms on-site, the event won’t be able to recruit the same caliber of talent. So the issue’s gone to the courts. In September, lawyers for Bonner County filed a lawsuit against the city, arguing “Sandpoint’s conduct violates the express provisions of the Idaho Constitution and Idaho statutes.” And Sandpoint taxpayers are footing the bill for both the suit and its defense. Whatever happens to the festival, it will be far from the end of the fight. As Sheriff Wheeler told me, there are other city-owned properties, including the field where the high school team currently plays football, that local gun rights advocates will look to next in order to “firm up” open carry. As they see it, they’re simply protecting unalienable constitutional rights. Polling, popular opinion, unabated mass shootings — none of it matters. These activists don’t care if gun rights are popular or not. They’re not right or wrong; they just are. And, at least for now, the president, state and federal lawmakers, and the courts agree with them. When Herndon filmed himself at the festival on Aug. 9, he wasn’t just making an amplifiable piece of media to activate a national audience. He was creating a test case — one with ramifications that extend far beyond a music festival in North Idaho. How far can businesses and individuals actually push gun control measures in the absence of legislative action — and how aggressive will activists become in their attempt to fortify their rights everywhere else? Greg Pruett, president of the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance, speaks at the Eagles Lodge in Sandpoint. None of this would’ve happened if not for a man named Greg Pruett, who, as the head of the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance (ISAA), has spearheaded every major gun owners’ rights campaign in the state. Pushing constitutional carry through the Idaho legislature? That’s the work of ISAA. Dropping the age of constitutional carry down to 18? ISAA. Turning the issue of guns at a music festival into a court case that could set a national precedent? ISAA. The goal: turning Idaho into a “Second Amendment sanctuary state.” Pruett, age 38, has a close-cut red hair and a trim beard. He’s a registered lobbyist with the state of Idaho — a point he likes to poke fun at when addressing his supporters — but he’s not slick or adept at glad-handing. Still, he has a quick smile and an ease with addressing groups that many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints develop growing up regularly giving testimony — to friends, during worship, on their missions. I met with Pruett in September at a restaurant just outside of Sandpoint, where he’d spent the afternoon running a training session on how to contact and persuade political leaders, especially when it comes to gun rights. He wore an oversize hoodie, a baseball cap, and a concealed pistol; his friend and driver, Seth Rosquist, sipped water beside him. Pruett grew up in Pocatello, Idaho, a mostly Mormon college town in the southeastern corner of the state. Napoleon Dynamite wasn’t filmed there, but you’d swear it was. Growing up, Pruett was surrounded by family, his church, and guns, which he used primarily for hunting deer, elk, and turkey. He served his mission in Japan, attended Boise State University, and enlisted in the Idaho National Guard, performing a tour in Iraq before being medically retired in 2014. Like other advocates for constitutional carry, Pruett views it as a right — but one he said he never takes lightly. He only open carries when he’s dressed up (and there’s nowhere to conceal the weapon) or to make a political point. Other times he conceals his weapon, as does Rosquist, who works as a math tutor through Veterans Upward Bound. “Carrying a gun, it’s a commitment, and a pain in the butt,” Rosquist said. “I’ve carried pretty much every day for 12, 13 years, and some days I look at it, this heavy piece of metal, and I’m like, ugh. It’s a mental exercise I go through every day, before I strap on: Am I fit for this today? And some days I’m not.” When Pruett was serving in the National Guard, Idaho was in the throes of transformation and Boise was on its way to becoming the fastest-growing metro area in the United States. Many people arriving were from California, but they were also increasingly coming from all sorts of urban areas — Seattle, Portland, Denver. While some were fleeing the politics of the so-called Great Blue Wall, others were bringing those same politics with them. Through the ’80s and ’90s, Idaho voters were still pretty evenly split between liberals and conservatives. But shifting loyalties — largely due to Republicans successfully painting Democrats as environmentalist villains responsible for the decimation of the state’s mining and timber industries — meant that by 2014, Idaho had become of the reddest states in the country. Out of 105 seats in the state legislature, Republicans held 84 of them. Since 2008, the rise of the tea party had pushed the Idaho GOP further and further to the right. All over the state, sitting GOP lawmakers, county commissioners, sheriffs, and county clerks were primaried from the right, defeated by candidates promising to uphold “truly” conservative values. But even with more and more “liberty-minded” lawmakers in office, Pruett looked at the legislature and wondered: If it was truly filled with Constitution-loving conservatives, then why hadn’t they passed constitutional carry? Pamphlets are passed through the crowd during the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance's ""Freedom Tour"" at Eagles Lodge in Sandpoint. That was the impetus for the ISAA, formed in August 2012, which Pruett vowed would be more than just a Facebook page filled with righteous anger and memes. Instead, ISAA would focus on legislative action: lobbying at the capital, but also coordinating supporters to individually contact, cajole, and otherwise convince their representatives to support more robust pro-gun legislation. It would do what the NRA, with its increasingly toxic reputation and scandal-plagued leadership, could or would not. Pruett has become well known for his methodical efficacy at the capitol, which is supported, financially and otherwise, by the more than 48,000 followers of ISAA’s Facebook page. For $10 a month, you can become a “Liberty Member,” and receive a membership card and ISAA hat; you can also buy assorted swag, including a pink women’s tee embossed with the Thomas Jefferson quote “No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.” Pruett also posts memes, circulates petitions (most recently, opposing red flag laws), publicizes events (this year’s “Gold Banquet” at the Nampa Civic Center, whose tickets went for $40 apiece, sold out), and posts detailed video updates on various legislative and legal efforts. For Pruett’s first attempt at getting constitutional carry through the legislature in 2013, he partnered with Alexandra Kincaid, a Boise-area attorney, gun rights advocate, and occasional Fox News guest. They’d first met outside a gun store, where Pruett was collecting signatures in support of constitutional carry. Together, they devised a strategy: Kincaid would help draft the legislation and provide legal counsel, and Pruett would get the dozens of supposedly “pro-gun” legislators to support it. But he quickly found that declaring oneself “pro-gun” was very different from being willing to support constitutional carry. “On the campaign trail, every Republican and every Democrat without fail will tell you they are for the Second Amendment, they are for your gun rights,” Pruett explained. “They all do it — you can see the taped photo ops with the shotgun and the John Deere hat on. But I started getting frustrated. How is 80% of the legislature Republican, and yet we can’t pass a constitutional carry law, which should be a no-brainer?” Pruett said he was told by legislators and their staffers to bide his time — or at least wait until after the 2016 election year. A recent study put Idaho’s gun ownership rate at 56.9% — third in the nation — and most Republican legislators, like their constituents, supported the broad idea of “guns and gun rights.” But many of those same constituents, including the gun-owning ones, also supported “common sense” gun reforms, like background checks. If a more radical bill like constitutional carry made it to the floor, it could put certain legislators in a tough place: vote against it and open themselves to a primary challenger from the right, or vote for it and open themselves to a primary challenger to the left. So Pruett decided to introduce the bill to the state legislature himself, but it was killed before it could make it to the House floor. He became convinced of the existence of a “secret gun committee,” which met in private to decide which gun bills would be up for discussion. If a bill wasn’t supported by the NRA, or what he calls “the establishment,” it wouldn’t make it to the floor. According to Pruett, the committee was also wary of introducing legislation that wouldn’t make it past Senate Majority Leader Bart Davis, whose son had been shot and killed in 2003. (Various unofficial working groups in the legislature do serve to filter which bills make it to a vote, weeding out bills that are too broad, unlikely to pass, or likely to get vetoed by the governor — much to the annoyance of both the left and the right. Still, the existence of a secret gun committee has not been confirmed.) Pruett believed the committee was short-circuiting what he saw as the demands of the Idaho citizenry — whose will he extrapolated from Facebook likes and shares, as well as direct donations. (It’s impossible to ascertain the geographic breakdown of ISAA members; many comments on the Facebook page are from people in Idaho, but many are also from out of state.) So ISAA decided to change up its lobbying strategy: Instead of pressuring lawmakers behind closed doors at the capitol, they’d start doing it all across Idaho, hitting where every politician is most vulnerable. “If you’re a Republican, or a Democrat, or independent, when we see someone violating the Second Amendment, violating the promises they made to you, as a citizenry, we hold them accountable,” Pruett said. “We’ll pass out mail in their neighborhoods. Say they’re stabbing you in the back. We’ll shoot videos in their districts. We’ll put them on Facebook Live. We’ll pay money to boost that video all over their district, to let their people know exactly what they’re doing or not doing. You can imagine how many friends I have in the capitol with that strategy.” But his strategy worked. In March 2016, with primary elections just months away, Pruett had conservative legislators in a bind. They could support the constitutional carry bill, or face the distinct possibility that someone farther right could use it as ammunition to vanquish them in the primary. On the second try, ISAA’s bill zoomed through the Idaho House and Senate, with 13 representatives and four senators as cosponsors. On March 26, Gov. Butch Otter signed it into law, allowing citizens of the state of Idaho to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without permit, in public. It was a major victory for the ISAA, which Pruett was careful to frame as a simple reflection of the work and will of the people. “We are happy to see the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Otter stand up and support the will of law-abiding Idaho gun owners,” he told the Idaho State Journal. Pruett wasn’t finished. He wanted to expand “stand your ground” laws in the state and lower the age limit on constitutional carry to 18. But the “secret gun committee” was still standing in his way — its will enforced, he believed, by Rep. Tom Loertscher, the chair of the state affairs committee and a 30-year incumbent from Eastern Idaho. Loertscher was a well-respected rancher in the community and about as “establishment” Republican as you could get. “He was the one who kept blocking our bills,” Pruett told me. “Some people might tell you it was [House Speaker] Scott Bedke who was controlling it, because he controls all the chairmen. But at the end of the day, the chairman has the decision.” (Loertscher countered that he killed the hearing for House Bill 444 — a piece of “stand your ground” legislation — because it had “numerous constitutional problems,” was “poorly drafted,” and lacked support from the NRA. He killed the bill because it wouldn’t have become law anyway. “It’s called leadership,” he told the Idaho State Journal. “And when you’re entrusted with leadership, you have to lead.”) In the spring of 2018, Chad Christensen, a member of the ISAA from Loertscher’s district, declared his intention to oppose him in the Republican primary. “I didn’t even think it was possible, honestly,” Pruett said. But Christensen, a former Army reservist with no prior political experience, campaigned by explicitly tying Loertscher to attempts to kill pro-gun legislation and otherwise curtailing citizens’ rights, including their right to bear arms. When Christensen won the primary by 39 votes, he shocked the world of Idaho politics. “We had gotten involved in other races,” Pruett told me, “but that was the one that really changed the way people thought of us. They realized, OK, the gun owners are not messing around.” After his defeat in the primary, Loertscher opted to run against Christensen in the general as a write-in candidate. But even with the endorsement of Otter, the governor, he lost again. Christensen’s first order of business in the statehouse? Introducing a bill that would allow citizens to carry concealed weapons on school property, with no need to declare their firearms to school authorities. (Somewhat poetically, the bill was later killed by the new head of the state affairs committee.) For Pruett, the work of protecting the Second Amendment is never done. It doesn’t matter that all gun legislation on the federal level is frozen for the foreseeable future. It doesn’t matter that Donald Trump’s in office, or that the NRA has a chokehold on most conservative legislators. Even if the existing ""stand your ground"" law gets further expanded, even if carry-in-school passes, there will still be more to do, because there’s no end, in his mind, to the attempts — on the local, state, and federal levels — to weaken the Second Amendment. And all of these attempts, Pruett said, violate the state “preemption” statute, an “awesome law,” in his words, “that says cities and counties are not allowed to regulate the possession of firearms in any way. They can’t do anything with firearms other than say you can’t shoot ’em within city limits.” And yet, with every mass shooting, there are attempts to do just that. Pruett can’t do anything about the advisories from Walmart or Albertsons. But over the last five years, he said, he's overturned dozens of anti-gun ordinances or signs posted in parks across the state of Idaho. And this summer, following the shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California, he embarked on his new crusade: going after anti-gun “suggestions” at public gatherings, festivals, and fairs across the state. Scott Herndon at the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance's ""Freedom Tour"" in Sandpoint. A week after the Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting, a sheriff’s deputy in Twin Falls County, in Eastern Idaho, requested that anyone attending the county fair “leave security to law enforcement” and leave their guns at home. On his Facebook page, Christensen responded by declaring there was a “movement to stop citizens from carrying at county fairs” and requested citizens from all over the state to alert him if any other county fairs attempted to suggest similar guidelines. (Twin Falls County later released a statement “clarifying their support for the Second Amendment.”) Over in Canyon County, outside Boise, Pruett had heard of signs indicating that guns weren’t allowed — even though the fair, like all other county fairs, was held on public property. The best way to test the rule, he thought, was to show up to the fair in July with a pistol on his hip — and tape the interaction to post online. Initially, fair security attempted to prevent Pruett from entering with his firearm. “Do you know what the state law is?” he asks. “Then you’re violating it.” Eventually, he was permitted in; in the days to come, the fair eliminated any mention of guns on the fairgrounds. Pruett could have filed a complaint. But instead, he created a spectacle perfect for social media — the sort that not only convinces his audience that there’s a problem in Idaho, but that he’s out there working to solve it. Up in Sandpoint, where the liberty-minded gun activists of Bonner County inevitably clash with the town’s more liberal residents, Scott Herndon was inspired to do the same. Pruett said he received “tons of messages” from people in the area, alerting him to the Festival at Sandpoint’s policy. At first, they tried to counter it “the nice way.” “We tried to say, ‘There’s the law; here’s what you’re doing,’” Pruett explained. “We tried to put pressure on the city council to turn it around. We sent letters; we sent emails to the City of Sandpoint.” But the city, which is headed by a progressive mayor, stayed firm: This was not its problem. So Pruett worked with Herndon to make the issue impossible to ignore. Herndon has a massive, bushy white beard that belies his actual age of 52. He’s a familiar, if controversial, figure in Bonner County, where he’s lived with his wife and eight children since 2004. He’s a home builder, a former jail chaplain, and a self-described activist; for years, he and other members of a group known as the Abolitionist Society of North Idaho have shown up at the high school and farmer’s market with graphic posters, yelling aggressive anti-abortion messages. Law enforcement is regularly called on the group, and Herndon has worked to perfect his interactions with the police, specifically regarding their right to assemble on public property. “I always film myself so I can learn how to present myself better,” he told me. “If I say something that doesn’t sound very good, I’ll figure out a better way to say it. I’m trying to figure out how to be persuasive. I’m always trying to improve.” Herndon always wants hard evidence of every encounter. “If someone misrepresents you, I have evidence to get the truth out,” he explained. “We want to protect ourselves, especially if the police do something unlawful” in their attempt to get them to desist. So when Herndon saw that the Festival at Sandpoint was banning guns — knowing that it took place in a public park — he decided to do the same thing he does with all of the rest of his activism: film himself attempting to uphold the law. You can watch the encounter on the Redoubt News YouTube channel, and Herndon does, indeed, seem practiced and almost preternaturally calm. He’s the lead actor in a potential test case, and he knows it. Security turns him away, he argues that the law is on his side, and they turn him away again. County-run fairs have no viable legal defense against proponents of constitutional carry. But the festival is a private nonprofit, and organizers argued that they were simply complying with artist demands, which would remain the same whether they were performing in New York, or a suburb in Seattle, or the Festival at Sandpoint. After all, two of the deadliest mass shootings in the last decade occurred at concerts: 58 people were killed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Vegas in October 2017, 90 at the Bataclan theatre in Paris in November 2015. Ban guns, the logic goes, and significantly decrease the chance of it happening again. To Pruett and those who support him, that logic is broken. Pruett told me several times that the security at the festival was, in his words, “a joke.” “They allow coolers in there!” he said. “You could easily break down an AR and put it in there.” But even that’s besides the point. People can make whatever dumb and unsafe rules they want on their own property, he said. This is public property. “The city is trying to say, ‘Our hands are washed because we signed a lease with this private entity,’” he told me. “We’re saying, the preemption statute says that cities do not have the authority to do this. And if you don’t have the legal authority to regulate firearms in a public park, how can you possibly sign that contract and give rights to private entity that you don’t have? That doesn’t make any sense.” After the video of Herndon confronting festival security was posted online, Pruett started raising funds for the ISAA to sue the Sandpoint into compliance. Within days, they had raised over $10,000; in a video describing the efforts, Pruett singled out and thanked donors from all over the country. “We intend to go to bat for you guys, because it’s not just about the city of Sandpoint,” he said. ”There are other municipalities across the state who are doing this exact same thing — who are violating your rights by saying that it’s a private entity.” “We can’t let these radical progressive ideas and these radical progressive policies and these radical progressives thumb their noses at our rights,” he continued. “We can’t allow that to go unimpeded — because if we do, then more and more of them will start doing it. If we let the city of Sandpoint get away with it, then guess what? Then it’s all the other cities, with all the other liberal progressives on their city councils or commissioners or sheriffs — they’re all gonna start doing it. They’re gonna start ignoring the law.” War Memorial Field, home to the Festival at Sandpoint. As Pruett was rallying support for the cause, he embarked on an 11-city “freedom tour” of the state. But before he arrived in Sandpoint in late September, news broke: There was no need, at least for now, for the ISAA to file suit. Because Bonner County, with the support of the county commissioners and Sheriff Daryl Wheeler, had beat them to it. County Commissioner Dan McDonald prides himself on his transparency. He willingly gives out his personal phone number and spends considerable amounts of his after-work hours on his Facebook page, where he posts conservative memes, county announcements, and articles with titles like “5 Things Marx Wanted to Abolish (Besides Private Property).” McDonald’s cover photo features him decked out in a sleeveless black leather Harley Davidson vest next to his beloved motorcycle. A set of professional family photos include him with his three grown sons, all of them carrying firearms; McDonald is front and center with an AR-15. Bonner County Commissioner Dan McDonald The photo of McDonald on his Harley is also framed in his office. When I met with him in October, his reputation had preceded him: He’s known for his confrontational style in weekly commissioner meetings, his aggressive cost-cutting measures. “I’m no shrinking violet, let’s put it that way,” he told me. McDonald first visited the Sandpoint area in 1979, went over the Long Bridge, and, like so many others, decided, “We gotta live here.” When he finally moved, in 1996, he launched the regional division of an international roofing manufacturer, started making good money, raised his children, went on Harley trips across the Mountain West, and cohosted a local conservative talk radio show. For several years, he was a member of the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group that protests and protects what its members see as “violations of the Constitution.” In 2016, McDonald won his first race for county commissioner with the platform of making Bonner County “run like a business.” That included introducing “project management,” but also voting to give himself and the other commissioners a raise — “If you want it to be a CEO job, you have to pay as if it were the case,” McDonald told me. (The other two commissioners declined their raises.) He describes himself as conservative, and anti-abortion, but shrugs off questions about whether or not he’s part of the Redoubt. “I don’t like the term,” he said. The Redoubt, McDonald said, has no leadership, no official meetings. He thinks people use it as a bogeyman, to gin up fear of conservatives. “I used to say to people going on about the Redoubt, ‘Let me ask you a question. Do you grow your own food? Do you have a garden? Do you believe it’s important to, you know, put stuff away? Even if you didn’t do all that, you live in the American Redoubt. So therefore, you’re automatically Redoubt. Welcome to the club. Come by and I’ll teach you the secret handshake.’” Still, McDonald was certainly elected with support from voters who consider themselves part of the Redoubt. And like many Republicans in the area, he’s found himself assailed from all sides now that he’s in office: Liberals loathe his politics, while conservatives critique him for not being sufficiently conservative. “You slip out of their litmus test for one second, and it’s like, ‘Oh, you’ve gone over to the dark side,’” he said. “How many things do I actually have to do to prove my bona fides?” Now he’s added one more thing to the list: making the battle over guns at the Festival at Sandpoint a county issue. On Sept. 18, the county filed an injunction in district court against the city over the lease to the Festival at Sandpoint, citing the “chilling effect” it had on the exercise of the Second Amendment. The listed plaintiffs: Bonner County and Daryl Wheeler. Wheeler considers himself a “constitutional sheriff,” a label denoting the idea that the sheriff has ultimate jurisdictional authority in the county, superseding federal and state agents. (There is no official listing, but an estimated two dozen sheriffs across the country consider themselves constitutional sheriffs.) When he was the legislative director for the Idaho Sheriffs Association, Wheeler worked closely with far-right legislator Rep. Heather Scott to push through constitutional carry. And when he saw what was happening at the festival, he requested to join the suit. “In the state of Idaho, it’s clear these rights can’t be breached,” he told me. “To me, there’s not two sides. It’s not the festival and the county. There’s just the rule of law, and it says you can do this as a citizen.” Sandpoint Mayor Shelby Rognstad on the Long Bridge. Across town from the sheriff’s office, in the cozy coffeehouse that serves as a de facto meeting place for most of Sandpoint, the Bonner County Human Rights Task Force was finishing up a meeting where they shared art, music, and poetry advocating for political change. The town’s mayor, Shelby Rognstad, was there to observe. Some had been members of the group for well over two decades — helping launch it back in the late ’90s, when Richard Butler and the Aryan Nations first aligned North Idaho with white supremacy in the public consciousness. Since then, the group has worked to support progressive causes in the area, including passing the first citywide nondiscrimination ordinance in the entire state, and organizing a rally against Scott D. Rhodes, a California transplant who’d distributed racist propaganda at the local high school, torched hundreds of copies of the paper that covered him, and reportedly placed thousands of racist robocalls across the country in the lead-up to the 2018 election. These days, the task force is concerned about a Redoubt store that just opened up half an hour north, owned by the slavery-defending, Holocaust-denying pastor of a militant church. “We’ve lived through a lot of this,” Gloria Ray, a retired librarian and long-time member of the task force, said. But what was happening between the county and the city didn’t feel dangerous. It mostly felt dumb. If the court rules against the city, festival organizers have said that they’ll likely have to fold, since there’s no other viable private space to use near town. And again, taxpayers who live in Sandpoint will effectively be funding both sides of the suit — which won’t be cheap, given that it isn’t covered under the city’s insurance policy and McDonald has brought in the notoriously expensive Davillier Law Group to represent the county. At the coffee shop, Rognstad dragged a chair up to the table. He’s tall, thin, soft-spoken, very at home in a thick, cowl-neck sweater. He was also recently reelected, with a healthy margin, to his second term. “For 37 years, this has been the premier arts and culture event of the area,” he said. “And in 37 years, there’s never once been an issue with the festival not allowing open carry.” Rognstad grew up three hours south in Lewiston, attending the University of Idaho before moving to Sandpoint to start a local bookstore and restaurant. He’s watched as the area has continued to transform before his eyes. “Up here, I think there’s been a whole shift around gun culture,” he said. “It used to be you just kinda grew up around it, your family went hunting, you learned gun safety at a young age. No one needed to brandish their guns when they went to work or to the supermarket.” From left: Bonner County Human Rights Task Force members Sharon McCahon, Brenda Hammond, and Gloria Ray at Evans Brothers Coffee Roasters in Sandpoint. “When my kids were going to high school, I remember going through the parking lot, there were guns in the parking lots, in the racks,” the task force’s president, Brenda Hammond, interjected. “They’d gone hunting before school.” I remembered that, too, from growing up in North Idaho. Gun use was normalized, but I have no memory of anyone in my life open carrying. This was before Columbine, which happened during my senior year of high school, and before the election of former president Barack Obama, which ratcheted up the fear that gun rights would be eroded. Before anyone in North Idaho had ever heard the phrase American Redoubt. What changed, then? Sure, there’s the perception that even the most seemingly safe places — church, concerts, garlic festivals — can become instantly dangerous. But thousands of people had moved to the Redoubt area because they believed it was everything the places they were fleeing were not: a conservative, Constitution-minded place, free from liberal incursions. The reality is that North Idaho was never that way — and, regardless of the influx of far-right politics, it’s still not. But the suit is the latest attempt to return North Idaho to a land of wholly unfettered freedoms — to re-create a libertarian utopia that, like all utopias, never actually existed.

Tailyr Irvine for BuzzFeed News A .45-caliber handgun sits in a holster on Jeff Farnsworth's hip during the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance Freedom Tour at Eagles Lodge in Sandpoint on Sept. 28. Tailyr Irvine for BuzzFeed News Later that night, a crowd of more than 40 people filed into the meeting room at the Sandpoint Eagles Lodge to hear Pruett, the head of the ISAA, speak. The meeting was supposed to be on the lake, but a freak late September cold front had moved in, and a snowstorm was swirling through town. In attendance were a dozen men in work jackets and mucking boots, a handful of patrons from the lodge’s bar, kids dutifully coloring through the speech, and Rep. Heather Scott, who introduced Pruett and the Second Amendment Alliance as “the only group in Boise that’s really looking out for the little guy.” Pruett outlined the specifics of the case, made light fun of the security at the festival, and struggled to remember the name of the park where it was held. And then he told the crowd that the ISAA would be pausing its case while the county tried out its own, which would be filed in the state circuit court and could take years. The $10,000 the group had raised would remain on hold. “But if they back out, we’re going to federal court, absolutely.” What Pruett wanted to talk about instead had nothing to do with Sandpoint, or even — at least directly — with guns. Instead, he wanted to test the waters with a new idea: abolishing the state initiative process. Last year, a group called Reclaim Idaho, two of whose cofounders are Sandpoint natives, had obtained enough signatures under Idaho’s complicated initiative certification process to get Medicaid expansion on the ballot. Then, much to the surprise of pretty much everyone, it passed with 61% of the general vote. This year, it's mounting a campaign to put an initiative on the 2020 ballot that would raise taxes on corporations and the rich in order to better fund statewide education. Who’s to say, Pruett suggests, that the group won’t come for assault weapons next? Conservatives, Pruett told the group, aren’t good at organizing. “All we want to do is stay at home, enjoy our freedoms,” he said. But the “radical left,” they have the volunteers, and the organization, and the door-knocking ability. They have “Bloomberg and his cronies with Moms Demand Action.” Medicaid Expansion received some funding from the Fairness Project, derided by conservatives in the area as “California money.” And despite the fact that outside conservative groups continue to funnel significant amounts of money and influence into the state, the defensive ideology remains. Pruett insisted to the group, “We are outmatched, we are outnumbered, and we are outspent.” “What are we gonna do to stop the radical left from coming after the Second Amendment in our state?” he asked. “In all likelihood, they’re not going to be able to get much through the legislature. But if you were a radical leftist and wanted gun control, how would you pull that off in Idaho?” From the audience, a few voices offered answers: “Say it’s for the children!” one said. “Say it’s for safety!” “I heard it,” Pruett broke in. “An initiative.” “Right now in California, Oregon, Washington, Ohio, Nevada — there are ballot initiatives to remove gun rights,” he continued. “I watched it happen in Washington state.” (Initiative 1639, which contained sweeping gun control laws, including “enhanced” background checks and banning domestic abusers from obtaining firearms, passed with 59.35% in 2018.) “And now, at events in Washington, people will say, ‘I’m awake now. I’m ready to fight.’ Well, it’s too late! I don’t want Idaho to do that. These ballot initiatives, in our opinion, are extremely dangerous. If you want to protect Idaho, they have to go.” Pruett knew that, to some — particularly the more Libertarian-minded — in the room, he was speaking something close to blasphemy. The thing about an initiative, after all, is that it can be used by both sides of the political spectrum to circumvent the exact sort of political maneuvering and subterfuge that Pruett had struggled with for years. It’s direct democracy at its most direct. And in many states, it’s the most effective route to very Libertarian goals, including the legalization of cannabis. But the success of Reclaim Idaho underlined just how unpredictable a tool initiatives can be and how readily the population can vote for policies, whether it's Medicaid expansion or universal background checks, that politicians are otherwise unwilling to touch. Put differently, ballot initiatives — at least in Idaho — threaten to bring the law more in line with the politics and beliefs of the voting public, as opposed to the interests of legislators wary of a primary threat from the right. And Pruett sees weaknesses in the conservative hold over Idaho. In every video, in every speech, he reminds his audience: Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Nevada — they’ve all gone, or are well on their way of going, blue. Don’t you dare think Idaho won’t be next. “The clock is ticking and there is nowhere else to run,” Pruett told his followers in a post published the next morning. “Idaho really is the last state where any semblance of a conservative state may survive.” This is, of course, deeply unlikely. A recent study conducted by Boise State University found that 56% of California transplants moving into the Treasure Valley — held up as the bastion of liberalism in the state — are Republican. Instead of turning Idaho blue, or even purple, they’re confirming its conservative identity. “Idaho could change,” the study’s author, Jeffrey Lyons, told the Idaho Statesman. “But if Idaho changes, you probably shouldn’t be blaming the Californians. It’s probably something else.” A 2018 Idaho poll found that 86% of respondents supported universal background checks, including 74% of those who consider themselves “very conservative.” If the state does begin to walk back any of the ISAA-led legislation, or institute stricter regulations, it’ll be because conservative gun owners make it happen. And yet, what Pruett is doing is endlessly effective, whether on the ground, through shares on Facebook, raising money on the national level, or during Republican primary season. Even when you’re winning the game by dozens of points, relentlessly remind your team that they’re under siege. Keep scoring points, wherever you can find them. Be aggressive and tireless in your defense. Point out how close Idaho is to the slope, and just how slippery it is. Ruthlessly single out your opponent’s vulnerabilities. Play by the rules and be a stickler for them. Let up for even a moment and risk total ruin — which, for conservative Idaho transplants, could just mean a gradual transformation of the deep-red state that lured them to move into something more like the place they left behind. In Sheriff Wheeler’s view, there aren’t two sides to the case. There’s just the law, and those who want to enforce it. That’s a convenient, if reductive, way of thinking about it. No law is neutral; no law, even one established by the Constitution, is inherently right, or eternal, or immune from the interrogation of time and change. What’s happening in Sandpoint isn’t just the county versus the city, or the Second Amendment Alliance against the festival, or even constitutional law versus contract law, thought that might be what decides the particulars. At its heart, this is a story of an increasingly unpopular interpretation of the Constitution, and the increasingly desperate fight to protect it on all fronts. “We need you to do more!” Pruett urged the crowd that night at the Eagles Lodge. “At the end of the day, it’s our grandkids who are going to suffer for our apathy. For our laziness. And I don’t know about you guys, but I don’t want my kids to grow up in the country like that.” ● The piece has been updated to clarify funding sources for the Fairness Project, which provided support for the Medicaid Expansion initiative effort.  The Fight To Bear Arms The national war over gun control remains at a standstill. But in the small Idaho town of Sandpoint, Second Amendment activists are fortifying the rights they say are constitutionally theirs — no matter the cost.

311,https://www.motherjones.com/impeachment/2019/11/fox-is-very-concerned-that-impeachment-is-preventing-action-on-gun-safety/,"Fox News/Twitter In a hard pivot from what you’d ordinarily see on Fox & Friends, host Ainsley Earhardt made a desperate plea on behalf of Americans everywhere Friday morning: “We want gun safety.” Earhardt was complaining about the impeachment hearings, making the argument that the time and attention spent investigating the Ukraine scandal was preventing Congress from moving forward on other important issues, like gun safety. To the tape: Ainsley Earhardt: “America is not stupid. They are watching this happen. It’s weeks and weeks of impeachment. And they’re screaming, please we want gun safety” Is this a joke? Where was this after Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Pulse, Parkland, Las Vegas, El Paso or Dayton? pic.twitter.com/Af2GL22aMD — Cydney Hargis (@CydEHargis) November 22, 2019  Let’s back up a second. After each of the countless mass shootings in recent years, when a majority of Americans call on Congress to strengthen gun control laws, Fox & Friends hasn’t exactly joined that chorus of calls. Here’s what Earhardt had to say about gun control laws after the El Paso shooting, nearly four months ago: Ainsley Earhardt says gun control is irrelevant and useless because ""if you're bad enough"" to massacre people, ""you're bad enough to steal a gun."" pic.twitter.com/LjHvd7ZsgD — Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) August 5, 2019  And in September, Tony Perkins, the president of the anti-LGBTQ Family Research Council, went on Fox & Friends to blame gun violence on “an absence of morality” and lack of religion, rather than loose gun laws. Of course, impeachment isn’t the reason gun control legislation hasn’t moved. As Cydney Hargis, a researcher at Media Matters For America notes, the Democratic-controlled House has already passed gun control legislation, which Senate Republicans have refused to vote on. After an outbreak of mass shooting this summer, President Donald Trump promised to put forward his own gun control proposal. He has not done so.

312,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/school-shooting-threat-thwarted-los-angeles-county-after-ghost-gun-n1089711?cid=public-rss_20191122," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News Two school shooting threats in Los Angeles County, including one in which investigators say they found an AR-15 rifle, 100 rounds of ammunition, a list of intended targets and a drawing of a school's layout, were thwarted this week, authorities announced Friday. In one of the incidents, a 13-year-old male student at Ánimo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in Los Angeles was arrested after other students notified staff Thursday about an alleged plot, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at a news conference. Officials added that the threat was heard in person and a search warrant was obtained for the suspect's home, where the weapon and ammunition were obtained. Villanueva said an investigation is ongoing to determine the origin of the rifle with a high capacity magazine, although it does have a serial number and was not a ""ghost gun,"" a firearm that is assembled with different parts and has no serial number — a way for owners to avoid registering them. Earlier, Los Angeles County Undersheriff Tim Murakami tweeted about the school shooting threat as well as a case in which the department's task force arrested a suspect for dealing and possessing illegal firearms, including a ""ghost"" rifle. He clarified in another tweet that the incidents are unrelated. The school district involved in the school shooting investigation, the Green Dot Public Schools based in downtown Los Angeles, said its students are encouraged to speak up if they observe threats. ""We moved quickly to ensure that no harm came to our students,"" the district said. ""Our students did everything right by raising concerns with adults."" Villanueva said authorities are grappling with a series of threats to schools in the wake of the Nov. 14 shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, a suburb north of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that the 16-year-old gunman in that case used a .45-caliber pistol — assembled from different parts into a ""ghost gun"" — to shoot five students, killing two of them. The teenager turned the weapon on himself and died the next day. A motive for the shooting has not been determined, officials said. In another incident on Thursday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said a shooting threat was made at a high school in Palmdale, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles. A fight occurred on the campus of Pete Knight High School, after which a juvenile male involved ""made threats on social media and posted pictures of a person holding a firearm,"" the sheriff's department said in a news release. The male also admitted to writing threatening quotes and posting more threats online, authorities said. He was arrested for criminal threats and transported to a juvenile facility.

        Brianna Sacks Posted on November 22, 2019, at 6:09 p.m. ET The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said Friday that it arrested a 13-year-old boy for allegedly threatening to carry out a mass shooting at his middle school. Deputies found an unregistered AR-15 rifle, ammunition, and list of students and teachers' names at his home. The student attends Ánimo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in Willowbrook, in South Los Angeles. The boy allegedly planned to attack the campus on Friday, Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at a news conference. The boy told several students he was going to shoot them, and the students then told their teacher about the threats, Villanueva said. The teachers alerted the administration, which immediately contacted the sheriff's department. ""In this case, the fact that people stepped forward and said what they heard led us to be able to stop a tragedy today,"" Villanueva said. Deputies searched the teen's home, where they found a rifle with a high-capacity magazine, about 100 rounds of ammunition, and a ""rudimentary hand-drawn map of the school as well as a list containing names of both students and staff members from the school,"" the sheriff said. Authorities also arrested an adult relative of the student on suspicion of making criminal threats, though they did not explain how the family member was involved. The weapon is unregistered and Villanueva said the department is ""trying to find the origin of it."" It has a serial number. ""It does not appear to be a 'ghost gun,'"" the sheriff said, a term used to describe a self-assembled, unregistered, and thus untraceable firearm. The teen who killed two students at Saugus High School last week used this type of ""kit"" gun. The sheriff also noted that this threat does not appear to be a copy cat–style attack and said that, to his knowledge, the middle schooler did not mention any other shootings as inspiration. Rifle recovered from the home of the 13-year-old suspect. On the same day, about 80 miles north, another teen allegedly threatened to shoot classmates at Knight High School in Palmdale. After getting suspended for his involvement in a fight on campus, the student posted a picture of another teen holding a firearm and bullets on social media and wrote ""threatening quotes"" and other menacing messages online, Villanueva said. Deputies investigated and, during his interview, the student admitted to making the threats. They then arrested him for making criminal threats and he was transported to Sylmar Juvenile Hall. While the two incidents are ""totally separate,"" the sheriff acknowledged the sobering coincidence that two students threatened to attack their schools on the same day and were both subsequently arrested for their actions. The planned shootings are part of a ""series of threats"" that have been made against LA County schools since the Saugus shooting on Nov. 14, Villanueva said. In almost two weeks, the department has looked into 36 school-related threats, a sheriff's spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. All were found to be ""noncredible."" ""We have acted on all of [the threats] and thoroughly assessed them,"" he said, adding that, thankfully, ""none of them happened.""

317,http://rssfeeds.azcentral.com/~/609947100/0/phoenix/local~ASU-students-decry-campus-racist-incidents-amid-string-of-national-reports/,"A group of Arizona State University students gathered Friday to condemn recent racist incidents on campus that have surfaced amid a string of such incidents occurring on other college campuses around the nation. Earlier this month, flyers with a swastika and the Star of David were found in various locations around ASU's campus. Another incident also was cited, in which a photo of blackface was featured on a wall at an ASU counseling office on the school's Tempe campus last October, according to Zarrata Teacola, president of Black Graduate Student Association. The Multicultural Solidarity Coalition posted the image on Facebook, where it quickly spread. ASU quietly took down the image without issuing a formal apology or acknowledgment, Teacola said. “We are disappointed that ASU counseling would remove the racist image without apologizing to black students,” Teacola said. Teacola said the counseling offices are supposed to be a safe zone for ASU students but that it potentially isolated students of color. She said ASU is a “hostile environment for students of color, who feel there’s no institutional support.” Teacola said the removal of the photo was not enough and that ASU owes students an apology. The university issued a statement to The Arizona Republic in response to the Friday gathering saying that it is ""supportive of all students"" and that its top priority is student safety. ""ASU welcomes all feedback from students and will always actively listen to student concerns while working quickly to take appropriate action on issues when needed,"" the statement concluded. ASU President Michael Crow emailed a statement to students on Tuesday that he said was a response to ""recent events,"" but he did not provide details on what specific incidents he was referencing. Crow said in the email that he wanted to remind students of ""the values that bind the ASU community when it comes to free speech."" ""We can disagree without being disrespectful,"" he wrote. ""We can share thoughts and ideas without repressing the thoughts and ideas of others. We can speak and behave in ways that serve to inform and enlighten without threatening or intimidating others. We can and should learn from perspectives different from our own."" Crow said the university condemns any actions that threaten or intimidate anyone based on protected classifications including race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. He added though, that ASU is committed to ""free, robust, and uninhibited sharing of ideas among all members of the university community"" and would take action against any attempts to prevent free speech on campus. Crow said the university's expectations are that members of the community exercise their right to free speech in a ""non-threatening manner."" Carlos Galindo-Elvira, the Arizona regional director for the Anti-Defamation League, said the organization welcomed Crow's statement condemning ""hateful behavior on campus."" ""Michael Crow made it clear that ASU is no place for hate,"" he said. He agreed with Crow's condemnation of hate and intimidation while still maintaining peoples' rights to free speech. ""Part of our democracy is respect for the First Amendment, including free speech, but clearly there is a dividing line when speech promotes incitement,"" Galindo-Elvira said. He added that the ADL has had various successful meetings with student organizations and university officials to discuss how to foster diversity and respect on campus. The ASU incidents join a recent string of racist actions on college campuses around the nation. Syracuse University has had at least a dozen reports of graffiti, racist heckling and other issues since Nov. 7. The university boosted security across the campus earlier this week after a white supremacist manifesto was posted on a campus forum and prompted concerns of a potential mass shooting. That incident was later deemed to be a hoax. Syracuse police on Thursday announced they'd made an arrest following a series of new graffiti markings on campus but it was not immediately clear whether the arrest was connected to earlier incidents. University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Chancellor James Schmidt on Thursday condemned racist social media posts that were part of a private Snapchat discussion among a group of students. The posts included an image of a burning cross at an apparent Ku Klux Klan rally that Schmidt said: ""conjures memories of some of the worst atrocities committed against people of color... in our recent national history."" Schmidt announced in that statement that five students were suspended from the school's football team pending the outcome of a formal investigation into the incident. Iowa State University on Wednesday announced that it had received a report the previous day about a swastika scratched on a door in a residential hall. School officials reached out to all students on that floor to offer support and resources. The school also said Wednesday that officials were continuing to receive reports of racist stickers and posters on light poles and bus stop signs around campus. The university's student newspaper, Iowa State Daily, reported in October that a student government adviser took down an Instagram photo of himself with black paint on his face. A separate October article referenced neo-Nazi slogans and language that prompted concern around campus. The University of Georgia on Wednesday confirmed reports of swastikas that were drawn on Jewish students' doors in two residence halls on campus, according to Grady Newsource, the school's student newspaper. A police report obtained by the newspaper said the symbols were drawn in black dry erase marker and had since been erased. Police subsequently said there was no damage to property and that the incident didn't warrant a criminal trespass investigation, the newspaper reported. For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.  The groups also talked about concerns over the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol representatives on campus for a career fair last April. Their presence prompted protests from groups who felt their presence on campus could prove intimidating to students because of aggressive immigration policies that have been promoted under the Trump administration. After those protests, the university promised to give notice to students if ICE would be on campus again. However, ASU officials failed to do this when a student-run group, College Republicans United, invited ICE on campus on Nov. 13, said Benjamin Cooper, a member of the Associated Students of ASU who said he also was a representative of the campus Jewish community. “We want the university to honor its promise to give advanced notice if officials from ICE or Customs and Border Protection are on campus,” Cooper said. “I think we all agree that it’s good if the university keeps its promise.” The university responded by saying the ICE officer was not in an official capacity during the visit, according to Cooper.

318,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougschoen/2019/11/23/virginia-elections-prove-gun-safety-is-the-winning-issue-for-2020/,"For decades, the conventional political wisdom has been this: most voters may agree on the need for common-sense gun measures like background checks on all gun sales, but those who vote solely on the issue of gun policy vote Republican. If the 2017 election of Democrat Ralph Northam as Virginia’s Governor gouged that conventional wisdom, the 2019 takeover of Virginia’s General Assembly by Democrats — who ran unabashedly on gun safety — has largely invalidated it. Last Tuesday, for the first time in 25 years, Democrats won control of the both the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia state Senate. Hours after the polls closed, my firm began conducting a poll of 600 voters across 22 swing state House and Senate Districts — largely the suburban districts that decided who won control of the General Assembly. Our survey results showed clearly that gun safety was the top issue for Virginia voters. Further, it also showed that, by enormous margins, those who decided their vote based on a candidate’s position on gun issues voted for Democratic candidates. Table 1 My firm conducted similar polling in the aftermath of Virginia’s 2017 elections. In 2017, gun issues ranked as the third most important issue to voters, helping elect Northam as Governor. In 2019, voters ranked a candidate’s position on guns as their number one issue overall (28%)—ahead of jobs and the economy (24%) and health care (24%). Moreover, an astounding 83 percent of voters said that gun issues were important to them. Among those voters who ranked gun issues as their top voting issue, 66 percent voted for Democratic candidates in the election, compared with just 32 percent who voted for Republicans — demonstrating the potency of gun safety as an election issue. Not only have Democrats closed the intensity gap that used to favor Republicans — they have now opened a decisive gap in their favor. Table 2 Taken together, our polling and the election results themselves showed that Republicans made colossal political and policy mistakes in the aftermath of a mass shooting at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center in May, which left 12 people dead and another four wounded. In response to the Virginia Beach shooting, Governor Northam called a special session with the purpose of passing new laws to prevent gun violence. However, rather than seriously considering policy changes, the Republican majority huddled with NRA lobbyists, and on the day of the session, voted to end it without considering any new legislation, or even debating bills. Virginia Democrats turned the Republicans’ inaction into their rallying cry, highlighting Republicans’ failure to consider common-sense gun reform with direct voter contact, television and digital ads, targeted mail, and earned media. Our research revealed that this was a highly successful strategy. Among voters who saw television ads on candidates’ gun positions, 55 percent voted for Democrats compared to only 43 percent who voted for Republicans. Moreover, voters who said that ‘media’ on candidates’ gun positions were important to their voting decision supported Democrats by an equally large 56-to-43 percent margin. That being said, we wanted to dig deeper. There’s no doubt that President Donald Trump has been highly divisive, with historically low approval ratings. So, we tested nine different messages that were delivered by Democratic campaigns, including a message that a Republican candidate would bring President Trump’s agenda to Virginia, to gauge the effectiveness of gun-themed messages compared to other messages. Our survey found that the top testing anti-GOP message was Republicans’ opposition to background checks on all gun sales, with Republicans’ opposition to red flag legislation testing among the top three messages. Both gun-themed messages were more impactful with voters than anti-Trump messaging. Put simply, our polling shows that this election was more of a referendum on Republicans’ gun policies than on President Trump himself. Table 3 Overall, the survey confirmed what can only be described as a seismic shift, not just in voter attitudes on gun issues, but in the importance of those views to their voting decisions. It should buoy Democratic candidates who have proudly championed gun safety, and serve as a stark warning for Republican candidates — including President Trump — who have stood with the NRA, instead of the public on this issue. It should also serve as a roadmap for those who want to run for office this cycle. Indeed, Virginia’s off-year elections have frequently been a bellwether for the following year’s elections. Governor Northam’s successful election in 2017 was followed by a suburban revolt from the GOP, resulting in a Democratic takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives. In those congressional elections, it was the gun safety movement — not the gun lobby — that proved its political strength. Contrary to the longstanding notion of the NRA being a political heavyweight, gun violence prevention organizations outspent the NRA in the 2018 midterms, including Everytown for Gun Safety, which spent $30 million and overwhelmed the NRA. Everytown was also the largest outside spender in Virginia’s 2019 elections, spending $2.5 million and dramatically outpacing the NRA on the airwaves and on the ground. It’s clear that the public — particularly across American suburbs — doesn’t just support gun safety, but are now deciding their votes based on where candidates stand on gun policy. With the NRA becoming increasingly extreme, and withdrawing from its role as bulwarks in competitive elections, 2020 candidates should feel confident that gun safety is not only a winning issue, but may also be the key to creating new majorities up and down the ballot.

319,https://www.ocregister.com/2019/11/23/for-parents-picking-up-the-pieces-after-deadly-saugus-shooting-is-no-simple-task/,"Trending: Guest column | By Tim Haddock Picking up the pieces after last week’s deadly shooting at Saugus High School is like picking up an anvil. One of my friends described the past few days this way. The Santa Clarita community has been picking up the pieces, some heavier than others, in the days since the shooting. It started with a vigil on Sunday night. The school was closed on Monday. Students were allowed to start coming back to school on Tuesday to pick up their backpacks, books, cell phones, lunch boxes, whatever they left behind when they escaped on the day of the shooting. There have been fundraisers and benefits for the families of the two students who were killed in the shooting. It’s easy to forget there was a third child who died that day. The shooter shot and killed himself after his deadly attack on campus. My son, who is a freshman at Saugus High and was on campus when the shooting started, wanted to go to the vigil in Central Park. Thousands of people showed up. Students, classmates of the kids who were killed, spoke about their memories. City, school and religious leaders gave speeches. My son and his friends were not paying much attention to the words. He was too busy sharing time with his friends. It was more important that he had a space to be a teenager again than to listen and relive what happened the morning of the shooting. It was equally important for some to share their thoughts and remember their friends. At one point, a Twitter friend of mine posted a message about how many times she heard the shooting described as a “tragic event.” It wasn’t the right term. It was tragic, three lives lost too soon. But it was more than tragic. It was horrific, terrifying, senseless, and in many ways avoidable. Yet, too many people wanted to sanitize it. Kids died. As tragic as that is, it’s a memory that is going to stick with some of these kids for the rest of their lives. Violence is now a fixture in their childhood and nothing will change that. My son wanted to go to school on Tuesday to pick up his saxophone. He is in the school band and he left his saxophone in the band room when he was evacuated. He told me two of his friends were practicing outside the band room when the shooting started. They ran. They also left their backpacks, cell phones, books, instruments behind. For hours, he didn’t know where they were. The music teacher didn’t have all his students accounted for. The girls ended up at a nearby Starbucks. They were safe, out of harm’s way at school. We went to school on Tuesday. Counselors greeted us at the gate. It made me wonder how soon metal detectors would replace them. That is one of the answers people in Santa Clarita have for preventing future school shootings. People were talking about seeing armed police officers and sheriff’s deputies at other schools and expressing their gratitude for their presence. It seems one step closer to a police state. Schools are starting to look more and more like prisons, with armed guards and locked gates, than places of learning. It seems like a step in the wrong direction. All the Saugus High students were able to return to school to pick up whatever they left when they were evacuated. When I was on campus, I thanked my son’s music teacher for just being there to help the kids, my kid. I offered to help any way I could. My son ran into a few friends. We didn’t stay long, just long enough to pick up some things and see some familiar faces. The students won’t resume their normal school routine until after Thanksgiving break. They have two weeks off from school, to grieve, to heal, to worry and dwell on what happened. Time will help close some of the wounds, but there are some kids who just want to get back to their normal high school life. I wonder if they will ever have a sense of normalcy at school again. More details about the shooting emerged as the week went on. The shooter used a ghost gun, an untraceable gun made from kit parts. How frightening is this? Apparently this is becoming a trend for people who want guns but are not legally allowed to have them. They are apparently used by hunters as well. They are also perfectly legal to own. How is this even possible? It’s bad enough people who own guns have no obligation to license them or disclose how many they own or even show if they are stable enough, emotionally, mentally, to have guns. As a parent, preparing my son to return to school, return to his normal, high school routine, won’t be easy. The school district decided to keep the students at Saugus High out of school until after Thanksgiving break. My son wants to return to his high school life. His friends want to go back to band practices and club meetings and hanging out at lunch and after school. They all want to find some kind of normalcy again. The Hart school district set up a #SaugusStrong web page full of resources and links to help students and parents prepare for the return to school in the aftermath of a mass shooting. It’s all helpful and disturbing. Who wants to read about critical incident stress management or managing distress in the aftermath of a mass shooting? Reading about how to talk to your kid after losing a band competition sounds much more enjoyable. Sometimes it feels like picking up the pieces is damn near impossible. The Moms Demand Action movement, a national organization addressing gun violence, had a meeting on Thursday night in Santa Clarita. A friend of mine went. She has kids in schools in the Hart district, but they don’t go to Saugus High. About 100 people showed up. Usually around 30 attend regularly, she said. The meeting covered a variety of topics, including a reminder that the goal of the movement is not to ban all guns, but to create some sensible regulations about guns. The ones that exist are clearly not working and it would be nice to see some changes. We lived in a time when anyone can have a gun. It would nice to try putting some rules in place to make sure the people who shouldn’t have guns don’t have them. That is one step in the right direction. But it’s hard to decide which direction to move lately. I am one of those people who have been saying enough is enough for a while. Words don’t seem to be making many changes. Dead kids aren’t making much of a difference either. These types of shootings happen too often to ignore, but they also happen so frequently that none make much of an impact toward changing the gun culture in the country. In the days since the Saugus shooting, there was another deadly shooting at a Walmart in Oklahoma, a high school football game in New Jersey, and a mass shooting plot at a middle school in South Los Angeles was stopped by police. When will enough be enough to make changes? That piece is the hardest to move. Tim Haddock is an assistant news editor at Southern California News Group and the parent of a Saugus High student.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a movie about how startling it is to be brought back to an open-heartedness that most of us spend our lives unlearning. By
      
        Anne Helen Petersen Posted on November 23, 2019, at 10:37 a.m. ET Matthew Rhys and Tom Hanks in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019). A friend of mine once told me about what happens on his meditation retreats, where attendees stay silent and engaged in some form of meditation for days on end. At some point, usually a day or so in, most attendees find themselves weeping. Not because they’re suddenly enlightened, but because the experience of spending so much time in an unmediated encounter with one’s self, with no distractions, is terrifyingly intense. I’ve heard of similar reactions from long-distance runners, and long-term yoga practitioners, both of which make the body unignorable, the mind inescapable. We say we go on runs or meditate to “get out of our heads,” but the real effect is to actually burrow deep inside them, to concentrate wholly on the self. For many of us, that experience is so rare that tears are the natural, involuntary result — like seeing a good friend, long neglected, after so many years. Something very similar happens to me, and many other adults, when we watch movies about Mister Rogers. Last year, there was the documentary Won’t You Be My Neighbor; now there’s the narrative film A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, directed by Marielle Heller and inspired by Tom Junod’s Esquire profile of Fred Rogers published in 1998. The documentary featured interviews with Rogers’ colleagues and contemporaries, interspersed with footage of the original show. But A Beautiful Day follows Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), a jaded, workaholic journalist assigned to profile Rogers, who is convincingly embodied by Tom Hanks. Lloyd’s interactions with Rogers are all buttressed by the breaking down of his own life: When his long-estranged father (Chris Cooper) shows up at his sister’s wedding, they get into a fistfight; Lloyd, who’s also a new father, and dealing with/diligently ignoring his own relationship to fatherhood, shows up for his first interview with a black eye. Lloyd, loosely based on Junod, considers himself an investigative journalist and has developed a reputation as a writer with contempt for humanity: None of the other subjects for Esquire’s Hero Issue would agree to let him profile them. When he’s first assigned the story, and through his first meeting with Rogers, he’s most interested in figuring out who the “real” Rogers is — and how much the guy onscreen is an act and a lie. Rogers of course convinces him otherwise, simply by, well, being Mister Rogers. He spends time with Lloyd. He asks him questions, and then more questions, and waits through silences when Lloyd can’t answer them. He’s patient, and kind, and authentically caring. At first, Lloyd finds the process, and Rogers himself, infuriating — and deeply discombobulating, especially amid the wreckage of his own family. But then, very gradually, Rogers’ presence begins to transform him. Rogers dedicated his life and decades of programming to helping children actually feel their feelings. Wallow in them, express them, process them. And adulthood, for most of us, is about acquiring the skills to feel no feelings at all. Feelings are distracting, inefficient, unoptimizable, unprofessional — childlike. They interfere with our capacity to work. In fact, some of us use work, especially if we’re “good” at it, to avoid our feelings. Like doctors, or social workers, or anyone else who works in a field landmined with intense emotions, journalists bifurcate themselves in order to survive: There’s the reporting self, tasked with documenting the world, no matter how devastating, which is walled off from the feeling self. It’s a coping mechanism, a survival strategy, but with time (and without therapy) that distanced posture just becomes the posture. Hanks as Mister Rogers. I’ve cultivated that distance while reporting on mass shooting survivors, and women who’d left a polygamous sect, and Syrian refugees attempting to rebuild their lives. It’s there when I listen attentively to people at political rallies who tell me that feminists and journalists are trash, or open my inbox to death threats. It’s how you can spot me and other journalists as we stand at a demonstration, or a rally, or a church service: blending in, but always slightly apart, with analytical distance. When you do feel some inconvenient emotion creeping in, you head it off by doing more work, more writing, more analysis: breaking it down, flattening it on the page. In A Beautiful Day, when Lloyd finds himself out of control, beholden to his fear and sadness, he flees to go to work. You can tell it’s a strategy that’s worked for him for years. But this time, his work means talking to Mister Rogers. You could say I identified with Lloyd because he’s a journalist, but I think I mostly identified with him because he’s an adult human in a society where we’re told, from a young age, that the best way to fix something is to work harder. We swallow existential questions, and the despair or wonder that blooms from them, and work. Fear of losing a job, fear of losing a parent, fear of being a bad parent — instead of sitting with those feelings, again, we work. Because work means money, and money brings a modicum of stability, and relief, however temporary, from that same fear. Work doesn’t actually give us peace or solve our problems. But for a lot of us, it’s what we’re good at and what we know, which is far more comforting than staring at the abyss of what we don’t. What Rogers does to Lloyd — and what this movie did to me — is eliminate that escape route. He asks questions about Lloyd’s childhood, and asks them again until he answers. At one point, while trying, with great difficulty, to talk about Lloyd’s father and the anger Lloyd feels toward him, Rogers does something he was famous for: He stops the conversation and asks Lloyd to spend a full minute thinking of all the people responsible for “loving him into being.” In a different sort of movie, the audience would be privy to Lloyd’s thoughts via a tear-jerking, sepia-toned flashback. Instead, the camera sits with Rogers and Lloyd for that full minute. In movie time, it feels like an eternity. Which is part of the point: We’re so unaccustomed to taking one full minute of time to be with ourselves, for ourselves only. Rhys as Lloyd Vogel. At the end of Won’t You Be My Neighbor, the audience is explicitly asked to try this exercise. At that point in the documentary I had already been crying for a solid half hour, so it just made me cry harder. This time, watching A Beautiful Day, I had somehow steeled myself — maybe because I was sitting in the theater with a notebook on my lap, studiously taking notes. Working, yet again, instead of feeling. But then Tracy Chapman’s song “The Promise” starts playing. It’s a categorically sad song, but it’s also one that, for me, leads into a labyrinth of memories, freighted with emotion so thick I struggle to articulate it, all of it stemming from my early high school years. Sometimes that teenage self feels like an entirely different person: a person who felt, well, everything, in stark contrast to my analytical adult self. But sometimes, like in that moment, I’m enveloped by her. It’s moments like these — as the poet Seamus Heaney writes in “Postscript” — “catch the heart off guard and blow it open.” That’s what Mister Rogers, in documentary or reenactment, does to adults: He brings us back to the openheartedness of childhood, when we lacked the skill to deflect, or compartmentalize, or resort to work. The experience of returning to that self, like the experience of a multiday meditation retreat, is at once startling and deeply sad. Who have I become if that self feels like a stranger? Throughout the beginning of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Lloyd is convinced that there’s a divide between the public, sainted persona of Mister Rogers, the television character, and the private, imperfect, real-life person of Fred Rogers. What he discovers is the same thing that has sanctified Rogers in the American imaginary: There is no public and private, no performance. His “persona” was so effective, and resonated so deeply, because it was simply who he was. At one point, Lloyd asks Rogers’ wife, Joanne, what it feels like to be married to a saint — a characterization she immediately rejects. “If you think of him as a saint,” she says, “his way of being is unattainable.” But it is nonetheless a practice: a decision, made every day, to care deeply about others, but also to refuse to insulate himself from the emotions that care requires. “To die is human,” Rogers tells Lloyd’s family as they studiously avoid talking about his father’s imminent death. “Anything human is mentionable, and anything mentionable is manageable.” So many of us spend years studiously managing our feelings by ignoring their existence altogether. What Rogers insists, in words and by example, is that the best sort of life is the one where those feelings are recognized as a worthy, inextricable, and essential part of us every damn day — not just when we watch a movie about him. ●  Anne Helen Petersen is a senior culture writer for BuzzFeed News and is based in Missoula, Montana.

321,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/23/ghost-guns-could-a-teenager-mail-order-kit-parts-and-build-a-pistol/,"Trending: After every mass shooting, policymakers, law enforcement officials and both sides of America’s gun debate zero in on a few key questions: What kind of gun did the killer use, how did he get it and could any laws have prevented the tragedy? But a disturbing new question was raised this week when authorities in Southern California revealed the pistol that a 16-year-old used to shoot five high school classmates and himself was an unregistered weapon made from a kit: Are California’s toughest-in-the-nation gun laws so easily circumvented that a kid might mail-order parts online and build one himself? Home-made “ghost guns” without identifying serial numbers have been used in a number of recent shootings, authorities said. They also have inspired several new laws. The Los Angeles County Sheriff said the .45-caliber 1911-style pistol used at Saugus High School was built from an “80-percent” kit and had no serial number. [vemba-video id=”health/2018/07/26/gun-violence-statistics-orig.cnn”] But building a gun from a kit isn’t easy, and recent California laws make it harder for those legally prohibited from having guns. Matthew Larosiere, who has built guns from raw metal blocks, said even a kit-build would be quite a challenge for the inexperienced, let alone a teenager. “I can say the 1911 kit build is not for the faint of heart, or wallet,” said Larosiere, legal policy director for the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun-rights group. “The 1911 kit build is something that would take me, a skilled and highly equipped person, many, many hours to complete. I’d be shocked to see a teenager perform it.” Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said it’s unclear who actually built the gun used in the shooting, which remains under investigation, and when it was built. The 16-year-old boy’s father, an avid hunter, died in 2017. Neighbors said they often saw him work on guns or reload ammunition in his garage. Villanueva said the father had six guns registered to him. But he struggled with drinking and police seized and destroyed his guns in 2016 after detaining him for a mental health check. Villanueva said he was no longer legally allowed to have firearms. “He became a prohibited possessor,” Villanueva said in an interview with ABC TV. But when deputies searched the home, Villanueva said, they found another kit-built ghost gun, in addition to the one used in the Nov. 14 school shooting that left the gunman and two other students dead and three others injured. The sheriff and others in law enforcement said they have seen the untraceable weapons turn up more and more in crimes, including on a convicted felon who fatally shot a California Highway Patrol officer in Southern California with an unregistered kit-built AR-15 style rifle in August. A mentally unstable Tehama County man barred by a judge’s protective order from possessing firearms used a home-built AR-15-style unregistered rifle to kill five people in 2017, and a man who killed five people in 2013 at Santa Monica College used a similar weapon. “That is one of the challenges in law enforcement today,” Villanueva said. “Congress and state legislatures enact all these crimes about gun registration, but now the gun industry is creating a way to just bypass the entire thing by creating a mechanism to manufacture weapons yourself.” The 1911 style pistol used in the high school shooting is a more than century-old design based on the service sidearm for U.S. troops from World War I through the Vietnam War and into the 1980s. It remains one of the most popular and revered pistols of all time, and most of today’s manufacturers market a version of it. The sheriff lamented the ease at which they can be built from kit parts. “They’re sold at gun shows, for example,” Villanueva said in the interview. “You can buy them online. They’re sold as a kit and then you can legally buy it, assemble the weapon yourself and then you have a gun that is not registered and no one knows you have it, and that is very dangerous. The information, unfortunately, is available on YouTube.” Gun-control groups echoed the sentiment and called for more regulation. “The bottom line is that ghost guns are incredibly dangerous and there is no reason why the parts are available at the click of a button,” said Nick Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. But putting together an 80-percent gun kit isn’t as easy as assembling Legos. Chula Vista online retailer 1911builders.com sells 80-percent pistol kits, but they start at around $950 and some top $2,000. By comparison, a modern .45 pistol like a Glock 21 retails for about $630. The company declined to comment, but its website says an adult signature is required to receive shipments by mail. The raw parts then must be machined using specialized tools before they can be assembled into a working firearm. A broaching machine to thin the frame and cut rail grooves will set a builder back $290. What’s more, recent California law aimed at cracking down on ghost guns requires as of July 2018 anyone who manufactures or assembles a firearm to apply to the Department of Justice for a unique serial number or identifying mark. Starting this year, the law requires anyone in possession of a gun without a serial number as of July 2018 to apply for a serial number. For teenagers, other recent law changes would pose a further frustration. Those younger than 21 are now prohibited from buying rifles and shotguns in California, and federal law bars purchases of handguns by those under 21. California law also prohibits retailers from selling ammunition to those under 18.Related Articles

323,https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/erroneous-claim-of-end-of-youth-hunting-in-virginia/,"By Angelo Fichera Posted on November 22, 2019 Posts on Facebook wrongly claim that Virginia has “announced the end of youth hunting.” The state’s Department of Game & Inland Fisheries confirmed that there have been “no such changes” in state laws, and scheduled youth hunting days remain on the calendar.  Viral posts shared by thousands on Facebook decry the “end of a 400 year tradition” in Virginia because of a supposed decision by the state to “end” youth hunting. But the state has in fact made no such move. “Yesterday Virginia announced the End of Youth Hunting!” the posts read. “The Governor said that no kid under 18 will be allowed to shoot a gun. This is the end of a 400 year tradition of kids helping put food on their family’s table. It’s a sad day in the Commonwealth.” We’re not sure what date “yesterday” refers to, but we searched for any announcements by the state government and could find no evidence to support the claim. A spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Game & Inland Fisheries told FactCheck.org the posts are “untrue” and provided us with a statement from the agency. “There are no changes to currently scheduled youth hunting days. All current laws and regulations pertaining to hunting in Virginia are in effect as shown on the DGIF website and the current Hunting & Trapping in Virginia Digest,” the statement reads. “Any changes to hunting laws would require action either by the Virginia General Assembly or the Board of Game and Inland Fisheries, and currently no such changes are proposed.” The department’s website outlines a number of youth hunting events that have been and will be held — including a youth and veterans hunting day for waterfowl in February, which will permit those 15 years old and younger to hunt, within certain restrictions and requirements. The department referred us to existing statutes in state law that spell out the legal parameters for youth hunting. Confusion regarding the age “to shoot a gun,” in the words of the viral posts, appears to stem from a gun control proposal pushed by Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat. A spokeswoman for the governor told the Associated Press that the proposed legislation would not have an effect on “responsible” hunters. The proposed legislation would modify existing law, making it “unlawful for any person to recklessly leave a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a manner as to endanger the life or limb of any person under the age of 18” (instead of 14, as the current law states). That crime would also be classified as a felony, rather than its current misdemeanor status. The same bill leaves intact a provision in existing law that makes it “unlawful for any person knowingly to authorize a child under the age of 12 to use a firearm except when the child is under the supervision of an adult.” So, even under the proposal, state law would continue to allow certain instances of minors under 12 to use firearms in supervised settings. The proposal is a part of a larger package of gun control measures that Northam proposed during a special session in July — weeks after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May — but the bills have not advanced in the Republican-controlled legislature. In other words, they haven’t been passed, let alone signed into law. After Democrats won control of the state legislature this month, Northam said those gun control measures would be reintroduced.

324,https://time.com/5737227/saugus-shooter-ghost-gun/,"Los Angeles authorities have confirmed that a teen who killed two students, and himself, in a mass shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, Calif., on Nov. 14 was armed with a “ghost gun,” a weapon which is becoming more popular in spite of the state’s tough gun laws. “[The Saugus High shooter’s gun] was assembled from parts, it had no serial number — it becomes what is known as a ‘ghost gun’,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told ABC7 on Thursday of the .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow, 16, reportedly used in the shooting. Authorities don’t know how Berhow was able to get the gun, as he was too young to purchase one legally. According to experts and law enforcement officials, ghost guns are becoming a more common — and increasingly concerning — way for criminals to bypass gun laws and get their hands on firearms. Ghost guns are self-assembled firearms that are built from unregulated kits or 3D printers. Kits sold online or by sellers, who usually don’t have a government license, contain unfinished “receivers” or “frames.” A receiver or frame is the main part of a gun that holds the firing mechanism. Under federal law, a completed receiver or frame is considered a gun even if it doesn’t have a trigger or a barrel. Receivers and frames that are manufactured under federal regulations are usually given a serial number, which would make a purchaser subject to a background check. “Ghost gun” sellers, however, avoid breaking federal law by selling almost completed receivers — known as “80% receivers” — to buyers who can complete the piece on their own with tools or machinery. Some companies will sell the “80% receiver” along with the other parts necessary to fully complete a weapon; others sell the receivers on their own, leaving the buyer to purchase the remaining parts needed for their gun separately. Ghost guns sellers operate openly online across the United States. As the Associated Press reports, “build parties” are not uncommon, events promoted on social media where people construct firearms together. Since ghost guns are put together outside of licensed gun manufacturing systems and don’t have serial numbers, they are almost impossible for law enforcement to trace. “These ghost guns completely circumvent our background check system and other federal and state laws meant to keep firearms from prohibited people,” Nick Suplina, the Managing Director for Law & Policy at Everytown for Gun Safety tells TIME. David Chipman, a former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agent and senior policy advisor at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, describes them as “an existential threat.” “It’s almost like a build-your-own-pizza kit or buying some craft kit,” Chipman tells TIME. “[The kits] are being marketed as all of the things you need to build your own gun. Some of these sites say you can build it in 15 minutes.” According to Chipman, the most popular “ghost gun” is built from the AR-15’s receiver. Given their very nature, there are no comprehensive statistics on how many ghost guns are being made, or used, across the U.S. — or how many law enforcement has recovered. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Glendale, Calif. branch of the ATF said in May 2019 that 30% of all firearms that they had seized were ghost guns. This is a figure mirrored statewide, The Trace also reported in May 2019: “According to the ATF,” The Trace said, “30 percent of all guns now recovered by agents [in California] are unserialized.” Rudy Escalante, Chair of the California Police Chief Association’s firearms committee, says that law enforcement officials in the state are seeing an uptick in the untraceable guns’ impact on gun violence. “Ghost guns are starting to appear more frequently and being used in high-profile events,” Escalante tells TIME of the Saugus High shooting. “We are seeing them more frequently in searches, and [in instances] when we confiscate firearms.” The Trace also reported that Calif. police departments view the rise of ghost guns as “startling.” Police departments across California tracking unserialized weapons have begun reporting recoveries in far greater number, year on year. (The Oceanside, Calif. police department recovered 19 ghost guns in 2018, per The Trace — a 280 percent rise on the previous year. In San Jose, the increase was 940 percent, with 52 guns recovered in 2018 versus just 5 in 2017.) By the time of publication, TIME had not received a response from ATF bureaus in California as to any relevant ghost gun statistics being tracked. In California, it is legal for someone to make their own firearm but they must, among other requirements, apply to the Department of Justice for a serial number. But this step is something that experts say criminals ignore, and are rarely prosecuted for. Under federal law, “ghost guns” are not illegal per se. A person does not need a license to make a weapon for personal use — only when manufacturing and selling weapons is a license required. Experts say this is viewed as a loophole exploited by sellers breaking their weapons down into parts. In 2013, a man in Santa Monica, Calif. killed five people and himself near and on the campus of Santa Monica College. The suspect had previously failed a background check and then assembled an AR-15 himself. In 2017, a man went on a shooting rampage in Tehama County, Calif., using two AR-15-style assault rifles that he put together himself after purchasing parts online. The shooting left five people dead, including the shooter, and 18 others injured. And in February of this year, a Texas man, Eric McGinnis, was sentenced to eight years in prison after he was caught in Dallas with a partially 3D-printed AR-15-style assault rifle and a list of lawmakers’ addresses. McGinnis was under a court order that prohibited him from owning a firearm. He had used a 3D printer to make the “lower receiver” part of the weapon and was able to get a stock, barrel, upper receiver and grip separately. While ghost guns are hard to trace, experts do believe there are some legislative solutions. Chipman says that both federal and state law enforcement needs to crack down on the sale of receivers and frames, so they are restricted solely for purchase in gun stores. This would, in turn, mean that sales would include the same required legal paperwork and background checks people undertake to buy a legal gun whole. Suplina points to New Jersey, which in November 2018 banned unregistered or unregulated gun parts, and says that other states should follow this. As the bill is only a year old, the state has not provided any statistics on its impact, but Suplina anticipates it is making a difference. “I imagine as the understanding of how dangerous these firearms grow, you’ll see more states taking action,” Suplina says.

325,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/24/fresno-shooting-hmong-community,"Four people died last weekend after gunmen fired into a backyard where friends had gathered to watch football. The victims were all Hmong Last modified on Sun 24 Nov 2019 06.02 GMT Within a year of moving to Fresno, California, Xy Lee had developed a close community of Hmong performers, a globally recognized singing career, and a plan to build his own studio. On Sunday, it all ended in an instant.  Assailants armed with semiautomatic handguns fired into the backyard where the 23-year-old Lee and dozens of friends were watching a football game – turning a quintessential American pastime into a distinctly American horror in seconds. Xy and three other men died: 38-year-old Kou Xiong, 31-year-old Phia Vang and 40-year-old Kalaxang Thao. Six other people were injured. All of the victims were members of the Central Valley’s Hmong community, a tight-knit group of families who came to California as refugees fleeing war, tragedy and violence in south-east Asia. Xy’s family first arrived in Long Beach when he was 14, but relocated to Fresno last year, in part because Xy was traveling so much to the city to perform. “He’s pure-hearted. He’s innocent. Why did you kill my son?” Xy’s father Xai Pao Lee said on Thursday, speaking through a translator. Xy’s mother and two siblings clutched tissues and large printed photos of Xy performing. They said they hadn’t slept in days and were struggling to accept that he was gone. Authorities have released few details on the investigation and the search for the killers. Survivors were unable to identify the suspects. Police said early on they believed there were possibly two gunmen. They’ve claimed the shooting was “targeted”, but have also said it’s unclear if the suspects knew the victims. The Fresno police chief, Andrew Hall, announced the formation of an “Asian gang taskforce”, but also said there was no evidence gang ties played a role in the shooting, The families have insisted their loved ones had no connections to gangs. The tragedy has brought national attention to Hmong Americans, and the vibrant Hmong community in Fresno, the Central Valley city 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The US armed more than 40,000 people, mostly Hmong, to fight in Laos during the war in the 1970s. It began resettling Hmong people in 1975, with a major wave reaching the US in the 1980s. Ultimately, 90% of Hmong refugees ended up in the US, including in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Many people in the community are still struggling with trauma from the war. “People on the outside don’t understand. Our elders are still suffering from some level of PTSD from the Vietnam war,” said Blong Xiong, a 50-year-old former Fresno councilmember, who came to the US as a refugee from Laos when he was five. “A lot of these families escaped the war, were shot at, saw people die in front of them. Now, we’re seeing it happen in this country.” There are now an estimated 300,000 Hmong Americans, with roughly 34,000 living in Fresno, home to the second largest Hmong community in the country. Vong Mouanoutoua, a local councilman in Clovis, a neighboring city, said Hmong families were drawn to the Central Valley for farming jobs and more affordable housing. “Our culture is one in which there is a lot of connectivity,” said Mouanoutoua, explaining that that there are 18 clans among Hmong people, represented by the shared surnames. “The teaching is, you and I had one mom and one dad some time ago, maybe 4,000 generations ago, but we are one.” There is a special bond within the clans, even if people aren’t related by blood, he said. So when the news broke that people were shot in a “mass casualty” incident at a time when many families gather to celebrate the Hmong new year, panic quickly spread and people posted on Facebook trying to figure out what happened. “I couldn’t believe this had happened,” said Nou Xiong, a reporter for the local Hmong TV Network, which broadcasts in Fresno and has viewers across the US and in Hmong communities in France, Canada, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. She soon learned the story was worse than she initially thought: The attack took place at her cousin’s home, and 10 people had been shot. On Wednesday night, three days after the massacre, dozens of relatives, friends and community members had gathered at the scene of the shooting – the home of Kou Xiong, one of the four victims. The vigils had become a nightly ritual this week, with people lighting candles under an altar with photos of Kou and his wife next to a bowl of rice, some sobbing as they shared a few words. The home and backyard looked nothing like a crime scene, and the family welcomed everyone inside for dinner, insisting two reporters eat their homemade dishes – beef with ginger and onion, boiled pork, mushrooms and lots of jasmine rice. In the living room, men sat around a table drinking beers. A photo from the Ban Vinai refugee camp in Thailand hung on the wall. Kou was a chef at a local sushi restaurant, who loved to host guests at his home. Children were in the house during the attack, but none were injured. “He was hard working. He wanted me to help him open his own sushi restaurant,” said his uncle, Neejkhov Xiong. “Now, I don’t know.” Neejkhov said Kou’s five-year-old daughter understood that her father was gone but was struggling to process, saying things like: ‘“He left without saying goodbye.’” During the vigil, the young girl ran around the house handing out water bottles and at one point asked a reporter if she could send a message to her father: “Tell him I love him so much … I miss him so much.” Kalaxang Thao, another victim, worked at an Asian grocery store. His wife is due to have their third child in January, said his cousin, Leng Thao. Thao’s family had moved to California “in pursuit of the American dream”, the cousin said. Phia Vang was also a musician and worked at a local lab, earning an income that supported his five younger siblings and parents, his father told the Fresno Bee, adding he didn’t know how the family would survive. The siblings of Xy Lee said fans across the globe had been reaching out. His recent music video, a ballad, now has millions of views. “Friends were always asking him to sing, and he never said no,” said Kou Lee, his 31-year-old brother. Xy had taught himself to play guitar and sing when he was eight-years-old and gained popularity in the last several years, Kou said. “Everybody fell in love with him when he sings.” “It was a natural gift that he had, true God-given talent,” added Kaonor Lee, his 21-year-old sister. Xy planned to open a studio in Fresno so that he could support other songwriters and musicians, the sister said. Xai, the father, said he didn’t want retribution for his son’s killer, but he wanted the person found and brought to justice – so he could ask him why he did it. As the families begin to prepare for funerals, many in the Hmong community are desperate to know who was responsible – and what the motive possibly could have been. No one seems to have answers. Pao Yang, the director of the Fresno Center, a not-for-profit working with the victims’ families, said the comments from the Fresno police chief had been upsetting: “The community is coming together. There are so many good deeds … This is not an Asian gang.” Still, the lack of information has left people terrified, said Nou Xiong, the reporter: “If people have a backyard, is someone just gonna walk in and shoot?” Katie Moua, a 25-year-old Hmong organizer in Fresno, said some youth were trying to reassure their parents and grandparents that they weren’t in danger, and that she was worried they were returning to a time when Hmong families felt unsafe or uncomfortable in these neighborhoods. “We’ve worked so hard to be free. We’ve worked so hard to feel pride in our identity and our city,” she said. “I hope people can still find a way to continue to live how they were living and … find things to celebrate this season.” Leng Thao, the cousin of one of the victims, said the community would find a way forward: “The Hmong people are very resilient. This tragedy has not weakened us, but actually strengthened us … and reinforced those bonds.” Standing in the cold outside the home where his son Kou was killed, Cha Lee Xiong struggled to find the words to thank the community. “I’m hoping this mass killing will be the last one,” he said, adding that he wanted to send a message to people outside of the Hmong community: “If it happens to your family, I will be there to support you.”",2019-11-24 01:00:15,'Why did you kill my son?': mass shooting leaves Fresno's Hmong community shattered,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us
326,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/24/obelisk-a-tribute-to-shooting-victims-p/,"Obelisk a tribute to shooting victims EL PASO, Texas -- A memorial was unveiled Saturday honoring the 22 people killed in a recent mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. The 30-foot-tall golden obelisk, called the ""Grand Candela,"" or ""Big Candle,"" was revealed to the public during a morning ceremony in the parking lot of the Walmart, which reopened this month for the first time since the Aug. 3 attack in which police say the gunman specifically targeted Mexicans. A private lighting was held Friday night for the families of those who died and for those who survived the attack, including the 25 people who were wounded. ""A memorial is important to the healing process,"" said Todd Peterson, a Walmart regional manager whose territory includes El Paso. El Paso Diocese Bishop Mark Seitz, speaking in both English and Spanish in the border city that is home to many Hispanics, called the site sacred and said he hopes it shows people can ""respond to weapons of hatred with weapons of love."" Days before the store reopened after a renovation, a makeshift memorial that had been behind the building was taken down. Police say 21-year-old Patrick Crusius drove more than 10 hours from his home near Dallas to carry out the attack. Crusius has pleaded innocent to capital murder charges in the attack. Prosecutors plan to seek the death penalty. Police say Vegas airport aggressor shot LAS VEGAS -- A man who entered restricted areas at McCarran International Airport charged and assaulted officers without provocation before being shot and wounded by a police sergeant, a senior police official said Saturday. Police identified the man shot Thursday as 32-year-old Jordan Henry and said he remained hospitalized in critical but stable condition. Police didn't release a hometown for Henry but said he arrived on a Nov. 17 flight from Indianapolis and that he had a record of arrests in Indiana and Georgia. Henry was booked into jail in absentia on charges of two types of battery and of trespass. Police body-camera video excerpts shown to reporters Saturday appeared to show that the first officer to encounter a man in a baggage-handling area used nonconfrontational language before reaching for the man's arm. The video then showed the man quickly pulling away and turning toward another officer who was next visible on the ground next to a police vehicle. Officers chased the man on foot to another part of the airport until a second encounter when another officer was knocked to the ground before the man was shot by the sergeant, video shows. Assistant Sheriff Charles Hank said one injured officer had a broken nose, a broken finger and an orbital fracture. ""He was very violent, very aggressive, in a rage, just extremely hostile, without any provocation from what we could see,"" Hank said. Officers' attempts to use a stun gun to stop the man failed, Hank said. Hank said police first encountered Henry after officers responded to an airport employee's report of a man going through a security door but then didn't find anybody in the immediate vicinity. Governor: Alabama sheriff killed on duty MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama's governor said Saturday that a county sheriff was fatally shot in the line of duty. Gov. Kay Ivey said Lowndes County Sheriff John Williams was killed. Details of the shooting were not immediately released, but Ivey tweeted late Saturday that Williams ""was tragically killed this evening in the line of duty."" She called Williams a ""pillar of the community"" and offered prayers and sympathy to his family and the Lowndes County sheriff's office. The county is southwest of Montgomery, the state's capital. Authorities said the shooting happened about 8:15 p.m. and that investigators were headed to an area near a convenience store. 3 people killed in train-vehicle crash JUPITER, Fla. -- Authorities say three people in Florida were killed in a vehicle that collided with an Amtrak passenger train, but no passengers aboard the train were hurt. The Palm Beach County Fire Rescue agency told news outlets that the crash happened about 1 p.m. Saturday in Indiantown, which is north of West Palm Beach. Amtrak spokeswoman Christina Leeds said in an email that the train was traveling from Miami to New York. The cause of the crash was not immediately available. -- Compiled by Democrat-Gazette staff from wire reports A Section on 11/24/2019 Print Headline: Obelisk a tribute to shooting victims Police say Vegas airport aggressor shot Capsized ship hard task for Coast Guard Vehicle's 3 occupants die in train crash Train hits vehicle, killing 3 occupan...

X OUR PICKS: An article in last Sunday’s Pioneer Press described updates for the St. Paul Ford site development, including the creation of 3,800 new housing units (“What’s next for St. Paul Ford site?”). As the planning process for this development continues to progress, I urge both the city of St. Paul and Ryan Cos. to consider the lack of universally designed homes available in the Twin Cities today. Universal design is a way of thinking that is integrated into the housing design process, alongside the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Standards. It aims to make ADA Standards simple, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing for everyone, not just for those who require them. For example, instead of retrofitting a wheelchair ramp on to the front of a building as ADA requires, universal design would suggest making an entryway with no steps and minimal threshold to avoid the need of a ramp altogether, while still making entry to the building easy for persons in wheelchairs, older adults who have trouble climbing stairs, and even for busy parents with young children in tow. Other examples of universal design aspects include wide doorways and hallways that are easy to navigate, lever-style door handles that are easy to grip, and good lighting throughout the home. Because universal design can benefit everyone and can be integrated into construction plans for little to no extra cost, St. Paul and Ryan Cos. should require these aspects of universal design in all new homes that will be built on the Ford site in the coming years. Elly Ryan, Minneapolis  On Nov. 17, letter-writer Mr. Thomas Bonnett responded to Moms Demand Action Deputy lead Marit Brock’s letter, which called for Mayor Carter to embrace Focused Deterrence programs to help address St. Paul’s record levels of gun violence. He praised Ms. Brock’s suggestion and proposed that MDA reach out to respectful and concerned gun owners like himself, instead of embracing “knee-jerk” or “gun-grabbing” solutions, as have some gun safety organizations in his view. In spite of using what I consider unwarranted and hyperbolic labels, I think his suggestion that gun owners be part of the conversation is not only fine, but necessary. And that is why I have always been heartened by the fact that since its inception, MDA has done just that. I know this because I have been a gun owner all my adult life and have been a MDA volunteer since the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida. In my chapter alone is an Army veteran whose history with firearms goes all the way back to his upbringing in rural Minnesota and continues to this day. We also are privileged to have an Air Force veteran who is a former NRA sharpshooter. And we regularly partner with police departments around the metropolitan area to get their perspectives on our work. As a gun owner, I appreciate the MDA stance of not anti-gun, just anti-gun violence. We recognize the complexity of the gun-violence problem in this country, and the breadth of solutions necessary to address it, among which we firmly believe is legislative action. We are also committed to respecting the Second Amendment. Bring your respectful, objective self with you, Mr. Bonnett, and you will find the same at Moms Demand Action, and we would welcome your perspective. John Barden, Prior Lake  The difference today and the difference durning the Watergate hearings is today there are no news people who have the respect that Woodward and Bernstein had and earned. Also there are no anchors like Cronkite, Brinkley, Brokaw and Koppel. They all had the respect of most of America. Today the media has no one with that character. What is missing today are a few good newspaper reporters that get the real story and their newspapers have the guts to print it. The hearings in Congress are so polarized and not factually credible that there is no support for no matter what the truth is. All that is important is getting re-elected and ratings and advertising loyalty to sell their advertisers products. Cable news like CNN, FOX, MSNBC are so polarized that they have little or no credibility. That’s all folks and good night. Tom Kapsner, White Bear Lake  One of the saddest takeaways from the televised impeachment hearings is to see the personal attacks and innuendo of the representatives of the Republican Party directed at some of the witnesses. Rather than question on the facts, their distortions represent a new low, when you think the tone cannot go lower. Attempting to vilify a decorated Purple Heart recipient who has dedicated his life to serving this country and keeping it safe is nauseating, especially when it comes from tweets authored the likes of Donald Trump, Jr., the “great white hunter”  whose claim to hunting fame is killing endangered animals in “staged” hunts, where outrageous sums of money insure the killings. But then, as they say, the rotten apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it? Alan Miller, Eagan  In regard to Macalester College’s decision to strip the name of Edward Duffield Neill from a building on campus: Neill worked for President Abraham Lincoln as an assistant secretary. So Lincoln knew him well. Now more than 150 years later, some today are passing judgment on Neill. If Lincoln thought Neill was okay, that is good enough for me.

328,https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-amazon-and-samsung-2019-is-the-year-tech-couldnt-stop-screwing-up/#ftag=CADa872701,"As we close out the decade, we've been forced to give up our dream of a tech paradise. The tech industry was riding high a decade ago: Facebook and Twitter were becoming vital tools for pro-democracy protesters around the world, Apple's iPhone was taking off, and a new class of startups like Uber and TaskRabbit appeared ready to change the world. As we close out the 2010s, the love affair we all had with tech has definitely soured. Social media may be helping connect people, but it's also been twisted into a tool of propagandists aiming to upend our elections. It's become home to serial harassers, who send out troll armies that threaten to rape and kill their perceived enemies. It's become a hotbed of revenge porn and conspiracy theories. It's the way mass murderers have livestreamed their terror. But it wasn't all Facebook, Twitter and YouTube screwing up. There was also Uber's IPO, WeWork's failures and MoviePass' passing -- among many, many fiascoes. As we prepare for 2020, here's a look back, in no particular order, at the crazy year that was 2019. This isn't just about what we think about 2019, by the way. Tell us about anything that caught your attention, and why, in the comments below. Samsung's Galaxy Fold was one of the most anticipated phones of the year. It's a tablet-size device that can fold in half, into a phone. It looked like the future. Reviewers loved the idea. Readers were clamoring to know more. But just days before its launch, reviewers began taking to Twitter to express concerns about its screen. Some had accidentally destroyed the device while removing what they thought was a protective film for shipping. Though Galaxy Fold preorders sold out the first day, the phone's launch was pulled and no money was collected. It was a shocking mistake by a company that only just in 2017 faced criticism over exploding batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 phones. Samsung eventually fixed the problem, adding a protective cap to the folding hinge and changing the way the protective film was put on the phone's screen. But by the time the gadget went back on sale in September, reviewers were focused on what was wrong with it. CNET itself tested how many times the Galaxy Fold could... fold. Turns out the answer was 119,380 folds -- short of the 200,000, or estimated five years of use, that Samsung said the phone should be able to withstand. Two years after we learned of Facebook's malfeasance in allowing the profile information of as many as 87 million people to be leaked to British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, the US Federal Trade Commission finally decided on how to punish the social network. The answer was a $5 billion fine and an agreement that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and some of his lieutenants would sign statements promising they were protecting user privacy. ""Despite repeated promises to its billions of users worldwide that they could control how their personal information is shared, Facebook undermined consumers' choices,"" said FTC Chairman Joe Simons in a statement announcing the fine. ""The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook's entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations."" Few were impressed with the outcome, though. Some noted that it's a drop in the bucket for Facebook, which made $22 billion in profit last year. Kara Swisher, editor-at-large for Recode, who's interviewed Zuckerberg in public several times, wrote a New York Times column titled: ""Put another zero on Facebook's fine. Then we can talk."" The thrust of her argument was that such a small fine in the face of Facebook's overwhelming wealth ""won't change anything."" For his part, Zuckerberg said in a statement that the social network would make ""major structural changes"" to how it builds products and conducts business. ""We have a responsibility to protect people's privacy,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry."" Amid its myriad controversies, Zuckerberg decided it would be a good time to wade into more politics by announcing a new currency called Libra. It was designed, Facebook said, as an internet-friendly way to move and store money. Though Facebook would be one of the biggest companies involved, a consortium called the Libra Association would run it. And Facebook itself would have a subsidiary, called Calibra, to handle regulation. Naturally, there was skepticism. This was Facebook, after all. By the time Libra had its first meeting in October, a quarter of the original 28 founding members (including PayPal, eBay, Stripe, Visa and Mastercard) had dropped out. As for Facebook, Zuckerberg got an earful during a hearing with Congress shortly after the departures. ""As I have examined Facebook's various problems,"" California Rep. Maxine Waters said to open one of the congressional hearings on Libra, ""I have come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project."" Apple says a lot of things separate its products from those of competitors. There's the slick design, the thoughtful software and the promise that everything will work together almost seamlessly. Over the past couple of years, Apple has also made the case that its products are more respectful of our privacy. The company even put up a billboard during the annual CES show in Las Vegas in January saying ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" Then, in late January, users discovered a bug in Apple's FaceTime video chat software that let you remotely turn on anyone's camera and microphone with little warning. Apple immediately shut down its Group FaceTime service while it worked on a fix. A couple of weeks later, Apple released a fix, and reiterated that it takes the security of its products ""extremely seriously."" When Tesla CEO Elon Musk got on stage, he had everything ready. He had a cheering crowd, an eye-catching new vehicle to show off and a demo to give. Two and a half minutes later, his plans were shattered. It all began with the with the Cybertruck. Unlike Musk's sedans, race cars and SUVs, the Cybertruck is aimed at -- well, you get it. To appeal to the truck-buying people who see ads like ""Built Ford Tough,"" Musk & Co. concocted a series of dramatic experiments to show how much tougher the Cybertruck is. First, one of Musk's lieutenants swung a sledgehammer at a normal truck door, leaving a dent. Next, he slammed it into the Cybertruck's steel door, and the door was unblemished. Then it was time to show off the ""armor glass,"" which Musk claimed was a ""transparent metal-glass."" His team began by dropping a huge ball bearing on a normal pane of glass from several feet in the air. It immediately cracked. Next, the armor glass. The first few tries, it came away looking fine. The ball fell with a different-sounding thud, and as it was dropped several more times, anyone wincing and waiting for the glass to break had likely calmed down and was thinking ""Musk planned this demo; it'll go how he wants it to."" That, dear reader, is where everyone was wrong. After the stage-demo science experiments, a proud Musk asked his lieutenant to throw the ball bearing at the Cybertruck's driver side window. A moment later, a web of cracks appeared where the ball bearing hit the glass. Musk, seemingly horrified, let out an expletive. For some reason, the lieutenant repeated his assault on the back passenger's window, and broke it too. Musk attempted to save face, saying, ""it didn't go through."" For the rest of the presentation, the broken windows just sat there, behind Musk: the new symbol of the Cybertruck. And Tesla will go down in history for one of the biggest fails in stage demo history. Oh, MoviePass. You were always too good to be true. A $10 per month deal that let subscribers watch a movie a day, every day, in most theaters around the US was perhaps one of the worst business ideas ever. Especially considering it costs at least $3 more than that just to see one movie. After a roller coaster year of drama in 2018, MoviePass cried ""cut"" and shut down Sept. 14. If you're looking for alternatives, CNET has you covered. Butterflies are beautiful. Unfortunately, they make for troublesome keyboards. In 2015, Apple began selling laptops with a new keyboard featuring a key design that was called the butterfly because of how it worked. (You can watch Apple's video about that here.) But it turned out the butterfly keys were prone to collecting dust, and of failing to register presses, or of sensing too many. The problems were vexing enough that Apple created a replacement program for the entire line while also attempting to solve the problem. Alas, even Apple's design wizards have their limits. With the 2016 MacBook Pro, announced last month, Apple went back to the standard ""scissor"" design. Reviewers were elated. The keys, CNET's Scott Stein said, feel ""more natural, and have a more generous 1mm of 'travel' -- so when you depress the key, you actually feel it move."" We've been hearing for years about grueling working conditions in Amazon's warehouses, but in May, CNET reported that the e-commerce giant fired seven pregnant workers, some shortly after they informed managers of their condition. The ones who stayed on the job quickly learned that Amazon's grueling work environment was even more unforgiving to pregnant employees. For example, Amazon tracks when employees go to the bathroom, something pregnant ladies do quite often. ""I said, 'I'm telling you this because I'm going to have to use the bathroom more,' and [a manager] said, 'It's still against the rules,'"" said Beverly Rosale, one of the women who struggled with work while pregnant. ""We can't control our bladders. If we have to go, we have to go."" When Amazon fired Rosale, she said, the company told her she'd been taking too much time off, without acknowledging her pregnancy. ""It is absolutely not true that Amazon would fire any employee for being pregnant; we are an equal opportunity employer,"" an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We work with our employees to accommodate their medical needs including pregnancy-related needs. We also support new parents by offering various maternity and parental leave benefits."" Amazon earlier said it wasn't able to discuss the specifics of Rosales' lawsuit or other lawsuits. But in response to a request for comment for this story, the company said it ""works hard to provide a safe, quality working environment for the more than 300,000 full and part-time employees working in our fulfillment and operations facilities across the US,"" adding that it offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and paternal paid leave, a work flexibility program for new parents, and full medical, vision and dental insurance. Over the past year, CNET also learned details about the relationship between Amazon's Ring subsidiary and law enforcement. We learned Amazon was helping police build a surveillance network with Ring, and encouraging law enforcement to hawk its video doorbells without disclosing the relationship. Amazon has also partnered with more than 500 cities to use Ring footage for law enforcement purposes, according to digital rights group Fight for the Future. In August, Ring released a map that lets you see if it's working with your local police department. The revelations culminated in a letter from five US senators, sent to Amazon, asking for details about how Ring handles video footage, what its testing and auditing practices are, and its plans in regard to facial recognition. Ring said in a statement for this story that it doesn't own or control users' videos and people get to decide whether to share videos with the police. Everyone in the tech industry is excited about 5G. This new wireless technology is supposed to revolutionize the way we communicate, offering faster and more-reliable internet for our phones, while also more easily connecting cars, medical equipment and all sorts of other gizmos. It's been slowly rolling out over the past year, getting turned on in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and London. But for AT&T, that wasn't enough. While everyone waits for 5G, the wireless giant decided to rebrand its upgraded 4G technology as ""5GE."" Industry analysts, commentators and competitors cried foul, saying AT&T's ""deceptive"" move would confuse everyone. Sprint even sued (the two eventually settled, though AT&T still uses the branding). As for all of us, it turns out AT&T's bet paid off. In May, about one in three Americans surveyed believed they had 5G. (They don't.) Of them, 40% were iPhone owners, who definitely don't have 5G iPhones, because Apple hasn't yet started selling any. Sigh. China-based Huawei is a popular communications technology maker known for creating reliable and cheap networking equipment and smartphones. But the scrutiny over Huawei has heightened over the last few years, in part after FBI Director Christopher Wray warned against buying Huawei and ZTE phones. This led to retailers and government agencies banning Huawei's technology. By this summer, President Donald Trump was calling Huawei a ""national security threat,"" though without evidence. Huawei was put on a government watchlist that barred US businesses from working with the company, which meant Huawei might lose access to key services Gmail and the Google Play app store. The company unveiled its own operating system as a potential alternative. Amid all this, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on Dec. 6, 2018, at the request of the US. She's been imprisoned since, attempting to fight extradition to the United States. Following Equifax's monumental privacy lapse, which allowed hackers to steal personal information of more than 147 million people in 2017, the company announced a settlement requiring it to hand out as much as $700 million in fines and payments to victims. As part of the settlement, Equifax said it would offer 10 years of free credit monitoring or $125 in cash. Well, so many people signed up for the money that the Federal Trade Commission had to warn that the pot of cash set aside might dwindle to the point that people who opted for the payment would get close to nothing. Stay tuned to find out which way Equifax will screw this up next. Oh, Congress, will you ever understand technology? So far, the answer appears to be a resounding ""no."" And thanks to that, we got several Capitol Hill hearings this year that went far off the rails. Chief among them was a hearing on white supremacy, which devolved into partisan bickering. Candace Owens, of the conservative college activist group Turning Point USA, argued to the committee that the hearing's actual goal was ""fear-mongering, power and control"" on the part of the committee's Democrats. One lawmaker responded by playing a video of Owens discussing Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's nationalism. By the end, many of the committee members had left, and all Twitter could talk about was Owens' fiery rhetoric and the streams of racist and ugly comments left on the committee's YouTube page. A Senate hearing the next day was no better. Titled ""Stifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse,"" it became a series of circular debates. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas argued, without evidence, that social media companies were broadly silencing people they politically disagreed with. As the 2020 election campaign heats up, tech companies are scrambling to make sure they don't get blamed for any problems that might arise. Twitter, for example, said it would ban political ads. Google said it would restrict them. Facebook, meanwhile, said it would allow ads from politicians to say whatever they want. ""The reason for [this policy] is that we believe that in a democracy, it is important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying,"" Zuckerberg said during an October hearing on Capitol Hill. ""Political speech is some of the most scrutinized speech already in the world."" Many people disagreed with him, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who ran an ad with a lie about Zuckerberg supporting Trump, just to make her point. ""Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies -- explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine,"" Warren tweeted. ""This week, we decided to see just how far it goes."" Zuckerberg still hasn't backed down. Cruz isn't the only person who worries about how conservatives are treated by the tech industry. It's also a pet issue for Trump, who's claimed -- without evidence -- that tech companies stifle his and other people's social media posts. The White House even set up a form in May, encouraging anyone who's been affected by tech's alleged ""censorship"" to speak out. The White House hasn't released the results of the survey. Still, that didn't stop people from pushing on tech companies directly over conservative issues. They've argued the companies need to embrace ""political diversity,"" a twist on the tech industry's efforts to bring more ethnic and gender diversity into its ranks. One of the most dramatic moments this year was at Apple's annual shareholder meeting, in March, during which some investors argued that the iPhone maker should have mandatory ""ideological diversity"" on its board. ""Diversity is not what someone looks like, it's the sum of what they think,"" activist Justin Danhof said at the meeting. Danhof, who's general counsel for the National Center for Public Policy Research, added that the tech industry's focus on increasing racial and gender diversity is ""racism and sexism."" The proposal was shot down, with more than 98 percent of voting shareholders casting ballots against it. ""We are open to people from all walks of life,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in response, noting that this includes political points of view, religious beliefs and sexual orientation. With Apple, part of the appeal is the promise that its software and devices just work. Until they don't. In September, the company released iOS 13 and Catalina, the latest in its annual free updates for its iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. Every time this happens, there are bugs and various issues that take the company a few weeks to iron out with another software update. But this time, those bugs persisted. In CNET's review of Catalina, Jason Hiner wrote that unless you need the new features, ""I'd recommend waiting for it until after Catalina's first few incremental updates."" ""Catalina is fairly stable,"" he added, ""especially compared to the early releases of iOS 13 and iPadOS this year, but waiting for the first updates is always safe advice for operating system upgrades."" The bugs were so problematic that Apple apparently is overhauling the way it releases software in the future, Bloomberg reported, to ensure that it's more usable on release, and not just after updates to fix new bugs. Before May, Uber seemed poised for an upswing. New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi helped turn around the company's toxic work culture, and appeared to be settling fights with cities around the world. And don't forget that Uber was one of the world's largest startups, valued at potentially $120 billion. Then we found out Uber was hemorrhaging cash. Like, more than $1 billion a quarter. It turned out Uber had never been profitable, and may never be. Uber said it needed to spend money to expand into new markets and to attract customers, but investors weren't convinced. Uber ended its first day of trading on Friday, May 10, at $41 per share, nearly 9% down from the $45 preopen price. The next day of trading, Monday, the stock fell even further, to $36 per share. ""Like all periods of transition, there are ups and downs,"" Khosrowshahi wrote in an email to employees, according to CNBC. ""Obviously our stock did not trade as well as we had hoped post-IPO. Today is another tough day in the market, and I expect the same as it relates to our stock."" It's currently bouncing below $30 per share, valued at about $50 billion. Uber: Well, that was a rough IPO. WeWork: Hold my beer. The company rose to stardom offering ""co-working"" space, a Silicon Valley-esque office environment you could rent, with beer on tap, Wi-Fi and comfy couches. Initially, it was all the rage with aspiring entrepreneurs, but soon it was being used by big companies such as IBM, Facebook, Microsoft and UBS. By 2019, WeWork was valued at $47 billion, based on investments including more than $10 billion from the firm SoftBank. I'm sure you can see what's coming next: The disaster began to unfold when WeWork filed its IPO paperwork publicly, disclosing a complex web of companies that made up ""We,"" and other shady business practices. On top of all that, it turned out the company's CEO, Adam Neumann, had done questionable things like buying buildings WeWork was based out of and then renting space to the company. Or trademarking the company's brand, and then licensing it for $5.9 million (he eventually returned that money, though). Neumann ""stepped down"" from his job in September, but not before agreeing to a golden parachute of $1.7 billion. At that point, the company's valuation was in shambles and it pulled its IPO plans. Oh, you thought we were done with WeWork? Not quite. It also turned out the company had lax security on its Wi-Fi networks, leaving tenants' sensitive documents, like bank account credentials and financial records, exposed. If that wasn't enough, the company in October alerted tenants that at least 1,600 of its phone booths in the US and Canada had ""potential elevated levels of formaldehyde."" Voice assistants have had a bumpy run so far. Sure, they promise to play music, help you automate your smart home, and even tell you the occasional joke if you ask, but they don't always understand you correctly. That said, they've been getting better since their debut a decade ago. And recently, we learned how. It turned out that Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft were all sending anonymized recordings to a group of contractors to ""grade"" how well the voice assistants understood us and to help them learn when they got things wrong. Oh, and they didn't really do a good job telling us they were doing this. Which is a problem when Alexa accidentally records you in intimate moments, or in the middle of an important meeting, or anything else really. Throughout the year, each company admitted publicly that it had in fact been listening to a sampling of recordings, and promised to audit its processes to make sure our security was protected. Apple went a step further, making its program opt-in -- so you're not a part of it unless you explicitly tell Apple you want to be. Typically seen as the friendlier and more politically conscious ride-hailing company, Lyft came under fire this year for allegedly not doing enough to protect riders from sexual assault, kidnapping and rape by its drivers. Hundreds of women have reported incidents, according to lawyers representing victims, and at least 34 people have either filed or joined lawsuits against the company. Uber reportedly has as many accusations, but lawyers said it has a better record of working with victims. Lyft allegedly tends to stonewall victims -- ignoring, dismissing or downplaying their assertions. Neither company has released data on how many assaults are linked to their drivers, but both have said they intend to do so at some point. ""Not a day goes by when we aren't thinking about the safety of our platform,"" a Lyft spokeswoman said. Hundreds of Airbnb hosts and guests have reported run-ins with bedbugs -- the small pests that tend to take blood meals from unsuspecting victims as they sleep. Though hotels, motels and other hospitality locales have also experienced issues with the critters, Airbnb has been criticized for reportedly not having a systematic procedure in place for handling outbreaks. Travelers have reported tales of waking up in rentals covered in red, itchy welts, or inspecting mattresses to find hundreds of the creepy-crawly bugs. In most cases, Airbnb reportedly won't relocate people to a new rental because they're too much of a ""risk."" Instead the company allegedly tells them to book a hotel. ""We take bedbug complaints as seriously as we would any safety or cleanliness complaint,"" an Airbnb spokesman said. Because Airbnb's business model is built on millions of independent hosts renting out their homes, the company doesn't have a lot of control over what those hosts do or don't do to keep house. And hosts have said Airbnb doesn't warn them that bedbugs can be an issue with travelers or give them tips to prevent infestations. Last year, Google employees made history with their worldwide walkout, spurred by sexual harassment allegations at the company. But soon after, employees alleged they were being unfairly targeted by management for their organizing efforts. Two walkout organizers, Claire Stapleton and Meredith Whittaker, said their roles were minimized. Stapleton said she was asked to go on medical leave even though she wasn't sick. In May, six months after the walkout, employees held a sit-in to protest a ""culture of retaliation."" Both Stapleton and Whittaker quit Google this year. Employees accused Google of retaliation again at another rally in November, after the company put two employees on administrative leave for accessing documents and calendar information that Google says was beyond the scope of their jobs. Activists at the company, though, said the move was punishment for speaking out against Google. Both employees had been involved in many employee protests, including a petition urging the company not to bid on contracts to work with border agencies, as well as a campaign against promoting harassment on YouTube. Amazon's giant HQ2 project once was considered a national prize. In 2017, the e-commerce giant announced plans for a second headquarters based outside Seattle. But the where was up to us. Governments around the country were invited to compete, sending in applications with tax incentives, development plans and other reasons Amazon should choose their locale for its second home. The winner would get 50,000 workers and $5 billion in expenditures. About a year later, Amazon announced it would split the project in two, between Queens, New York, and Crystal City, Virginia, just outside Washington, DC. Even before the official announcement, opposition to the New York campus kicked off. Several local progressive politicians, buoyed by the recent election of democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Congress, criticized the project. Amazon's $3 billion incentives package was derided as corporate welfare, especially because of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' position as the world's richest person. Amazon's anti-union posture in a heavily union city was another major problem. The addition of so many Amazon workers was expected to burden an already strained infrastructure. The company's plan for a helipad was mocked. By the beginning of 2019, Amazon had had enough. It pulled the project in New York. The drama over the whole affair is expected to cause more cities to rethink their lavish incentive packages to lure businesses. But it may also encourage other companies to attempt to copy Amazon's approach. Around the same time Amazon canceled its New York plans, Bezos announced he'd been blackmailed by ""top people"" at the National Enquirer. The gossip magazine, whose owner has close ties to President Trump, said the paper threatened to publish nude photos of him unless he ended an investigation into how the publication had obtained and then published text messages between him and his girlfriend. Instead, Bezos published the email exchanges he'd had with the publication, in an effort to expose the plot against him. ""Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten,"" Bezos said in the post, which includes emails allegedly from National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. This was particularly interesting not just because Bezos' dirty laundry was about to be aired, but also because he's the owner of the Washington Post, a newspaper Trump frequently criticizes (And calls it the ""Amazon Washington Post,"" even though it's Bezos himself who owns the paper, not Amazon.) AMI, meanwhile, had admitted just two months prior to ""working in concert"" with the Trump campaign to pay off a women ahead of the 2016 election to quash her stories of having an affair with Trump. The case is still ongoing. Electronic Arts seemed to have a megahit on its hands when it announced Anthem in 2017. The game followed a group of people in mechanical ""javelin"" suits (like Iron Man) as they traveled around the world getting rid of dangerous animals, fighting enemies and protecting one of the last human colonies on an alien planet. The hype followed for years until 2019's February release, during which things turned decidedly worse. At first reviewers, like CNET sister site GameSpot, found technical glitches, inconsistently fun gameplay and a poor story. ""Anthem has good ideas, but it struggles significantly with the execution,"" GameSpot's Kallie Plagge wrote after 27 hours playing the game. ""You never quite shake that feeling of disappointment -- of knowing, throughout the good parts of Anthem, that you'll inevitably come crashing back down."" But the community was already angry. EA staggered the game's release, giving access at first to its highest paying subscription customers. The game ultimately earned a Metacritic score of 59 (""mixed"") out of 100. Only 5 of the 76 critics Metacritic tracked gave it a positive score. Two months later, Kotaku published a lengthy article detailing Anthem's troubled development. At the E3 video game conference in June, EA said it ""learned a lot"" from Anthem's release, but the company didn't apologize to fans. At this point, EA is reportedly -- again, from Kotaku -- in the midst of revamping the game. We'll see if the second time's a charm. On Oct. 5, an esports star, Blitzchung, appeared in an interview at a video game tournament wearing a gas mask and ski goggles, and said ""liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our age!"" Blitzchung was expressing solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, who'd been demonstrating since March over Beijing's involvement with the local government. Blizzard acted swiftly, announcing that Blitzchung was banned from competition for 12 months and stripped of his winnings. The two broadcasters interviewing him, who apparently knew of his plans, were also fired. The backlash was immediate and intense. Some fans argued Blizzard was siding with the Chinese government because gamers in that country bring in millions of dollars a year for the company. Even some Blizzard employees were upset, covering up plaques on the company's campus that said ""Think Globally"" and ""Every Voice Matters."" Blizzard denied that the player ban had anything to do with China, but it reduced Blitzchung's ban to six months and gave him back his winnings. That didn't stop people from traveling to Blizzard's annual Blizzcon fan event in Anaheim, Calif. to protest. At the opening ceremonies, on Nov. 1, company president J. Allen Brack apologized for how the controversy was handled. However, many people criticized the apology for not specifying the actions Blizzard took and for not mentioning the company's ties with China. Really? One of the most horrifying things about the shooting in New Zealand was that the killer broadcast his massacre on live video over Facebook. Fewer than 200 people saw the stream live, and the social network didn't even know about the video until 12 minutes after it ended. But during that time, the video was downloaded and reshared across the internet. In the first 24 hours after the event, Facebook purged 1.5 million uploads of the video, 80 percent of which were blocked before going live on the social network. Facebook wasn't alone struggling against people constantly attempting to reupload the video, but it did bear the responsibility of being the place the video was created. 8Chan, a website that says it's devoted to unrestrained and anonymous free expression, was already known as a hotbed of conspiracy theories and harassment. But the website came under new scrutiny when a terrorist in New Zealand published his manifesto and a link to a livestream from his helmet camera as he killed 51 people on a rampage at two mosques in the town of Christchurch. Following the assault, more attackers posted on the site before they went on similar rampages. 8Chan became an unofficial destination for these posts, where fans would then encourage the killers. 8Chan went offline in August, following a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, whose perpetrator was tied to a manifesto published on 8Chan. The site's owner, Jim Watkins, was subpoenaed and appeared privately before the US House Committee on Homeland Security in September and said he'd keep the site offline voluntarily until tools were developed to counter illegal content. On Oct. 6, the 8Chan Twitter account uploaded a video featuring a new name for the site: 8kun. The new site officially went live Nov. 2. Watkins uploaded a video on the same day saying the site was experiencing heavy traffic. On Nov. 6, domain registrar Tucows removed the site, saying it breached the company's service agreement. 8kun is still offline. Juul was a huge success, until it wasn't. The vaping company, which sold vaping e-cigarettes that are sleek and look almost like a USB-drive. It worked by converting liquid nicotine into vapor, and is battery-operated. The company marketed itself as helping ""improve the lives of 1 billion adult smokers by eliminating cigarettes."" But it was quickly accused of targeting teenagers with ads, effectively creating a new class of addicted customers. Juul was surging in popularity, despite efforts to stop it. Even San Francisco banned the sale of e-cigarettes in June. And the next month, Facebook and Instagram began restricting e-cigarette ads. Everything changed in August, when Illinois reported that a patient had died after vaping. Soon, reports of respiratory illnesses in e-cigarette smokers were rising, and more people started to die. Though Juul wasn't the only e-cigarette maker, the Food and Drug Administration called the company out for claiming its products were safer than those from other companies. By mid November, 42 people had died, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And though President Trump initially said he'd consider a ban on flavored vaping, he reversed those plans. Juul meanwhile said earlier this month it plans to lay off 650 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, as part of an effort to cut costs amid increased regulatory pressure. What a year.

330,https://ew.com/recap/watchmen-season-1-episode-6/,"Welcome to EW’s weekly recap of HBO’s Watchmen. Each week, EW’s resident comic book obsessives Chancellor Agard and Christian Holub will be breaking down the loaded drama. In The Leftovers‘ second season, Damon Lindelof sent the show’s protagonist Kevin (Justin Theroux) on a mind-blowing, trippy, and metaphysical trip to a purgatory-like hotel in the episode “International Assassin.” Tonight on Watchmen, Lindelof and co-writer Cord Jefferson do something very similar and even more impressive and ambitious in “This Extraordinary Being.” Picking up right after Angela downed the Nostalgia pills, the visually stunning episode follows the comatose detective as she travels through her grandfather’s memories and learns about the secret history of superheroes in this world. Let’s dive into this awe-inspiring installment: Christian: What. An. Episode. Last week, Chance, you got to celebrate being right about the fact that there was more to the superhero/cop alliance on this show than met the eye. Now, this episode gave me the chance to relish having correctly predicted something as well. Told mostly in black-and-white, “This Extraordinary Being” confirms that Will Reeves was the real Hooded Justice all along (I knew they would’ve been the same age!). This whole time, Angela has been the heir to the legacy of the original superhero, and she didn’t even know it. As we’ve heard before from Laurie’s research, Will moved to New York City after the Tulsa massacre and became a cop — one of the only black cops on the force, in fact, which inspired another black cop to warn him “beware the cyclops” at his induction ceremony. Will soon realizes that this “cyclops” refers to a faction of white cops who double as KKK members and use a single eye as their symbol. When Will tries to arrest one of their friends for firebombing a Jewish deli, they hang him from a tree, cutting him down just before he would have died. A fake execution, like something out of Dostoevsky. One of the things that really interested me about this episode was its conception of supervillains. There are barely any villains in the original Watchmen. Sure, Ozymandias is the ostensible villain of the comic, complete with his mad scientist monster creation and mass murder, but he can also be a hero depending on how you look at the story. But even beyond that ambiguity, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons made clear that there were never as many costumed villains as there were heroes; Moloch the Mystic is the only one we actually meet. But aren’t the KKK, with their costumes and masks basically supervillains? Admittedly, the show’s KKK characters take it a step further with their literal mind-control plot, but I love the idea that the first superhero was created as a response to the supervillains of the KKK who had put themselves above the regular law. It’s an especially interesting conceit given the 2017 Moore interview that circulated on Twitter this week, in which he made the spicy claim that perhaps Birth of a Nation was the first superhero movie, which would make superheroes an outgrowth of white supremacist mythology. This episode makes precisely the opposite claim, that superheroes were created to beat the supervillains of white supremacy (one thinks of Captain America, the hero of two Jewish creators, punching Adolf Hitler on the cover of his first comic). There’s a lot more to talk about here; it feels like my brain is on fire. Chance, what did you think of the contrast between the Minutemen TV show (which we’ve been repeatedly warned was “garbage”) and the reality of Will’s life? Chancellor: I think that contrast is actually related to your last point. It’s easy to forget superheroes like Captain America and Superman were created by minorities (often Jewish) in response to the villains of the 20th century. As time goes on and the medium spreads, though, those ideas get lost as superheroes get co-opted for other purposes. “This Extraordinary Being” gets at this idea. When Will and his wife June create Hooded Justice, they decide to paint the area around Will’s eyes white so that people believe Hooded Justice is a white man. “If you’re going to stay a hero, townsfolk are going to need to think one of them is under [the hood],” says June. This is their way of making his mission to take down the racist KKK more palatable to the public. In fact, this decision reminded me of two superheroes. First, there’s Wonder Woman. Inspired by the two women in his life, Wonder Woman co-creator William Moulton Marston used that comic to sneakily spread his then-radical ideas about feminism, pacifism, and bondage. Second, there’s the X-Men. The fact that Will has to hide who he truly is from a world that he’s trying to save reminded me of how the X-Men were constantly trying to save a world that hated them and would love to exterminate them. Through his exploits as Hooded Justice, Will ends up inspiring others to take up their own masks and eventually the New Minutemen are created. Captain Metropolis invites Will to join, and Will agrees because he’s eager to gain allies against the racist conspiracy in the city. Unfortunately, that’s not actually what happens because Metropolis and the other vigilantes don’t care about Will’s noble cause. Instead, the Minutemen co-opt what Will created to fight supervillains like Moloch, ignoring the real bad guys who are causing even more harm. Similarly, superhero comics did stray from their nobler and more political beginnings and became overtaken by big battles, time travel, and end-of-the-world events. What I loved about this episode is how it does feel like its steeped in history and plays with several archetypal origin stories. In our recap of the premiere, I noted the similarities between Will and Superman’s origin stories, which this episode confirms was intentional by flashing between the pages of Action Comics #1 and Will escaping Tulsa. But “This Extraordinary Being” also tips its hat to Batman’s origin when Will stops a couple from being mugged in an alley right after he was almost lynched. Will’s one-man assault and headshot spree on the KKK’s warehouse — in which he wears his police uniform and not the Hooded Justice costume — also reminded me of the Punisher. One of the reasons there’s so much to dig into in this episode, though, is because of the filmmaking. Christian, did you find any of the visuals to be particularly thought-provoking or awe-inspiring? Christian: As far as filmmaking goes, I would say the most interesting visual element of this episode is the constant switch in perspective between Will and Angela as the person experiencing these memories. Laurie warns at the beginning of this episode that you’re not supposed to take someone else’s Nostalgia pills, which reminded me of the recent X-Men comic House of X’s very specific rules about not putting one mutant’s mind in another mutant’s body. Apparently taking all of her grandfather’s memory pills at once puts Angela into a coma (Laurie and others occasionally break the action to check in with her over the course of her trip) but I’d say it’s a fair trade given how much she learns about the secret history of superheroes in the process. The fact that Angela is actively undergoing these memories prevents “This Extraordinary Being” from feeling like any old TV flashback episode. Angela is as shocked by these events as Will was when he experienced them, reminding us that past events can feel as new and present as ever to someone learning about them for the first time. It’s yet another opportunity for us viewers to experience time the way Doctor Manhattan does, where the past, present, and future are all happening and intertwining at once. As the story goes on, this duality between Angela and Will becomes even more powerful, climaxing in the death of Judd Crawford. At last we see that Will wasn’t lying when he said he killed the chief of police; he just obscured some of the details. On his last mission as Hooded Justice, Will stole the KKK’s mesmerizing mind control camera. Over the years, he’s adapted it for his own use, shrinking the machine down from a mammoth old movie projector to the size of a flashlight. This is how a 100-year-old man killed an active duty police chief: By shining the flashlight in his eyes and forcing him to obey his every command. Except now that Angela’s experiencing these memories, she is the one killing her friend. King’s expressions are brutal as she undergoes this uniquely nightmarish experience. At the same time, things have changed since she first learned of Judd’s death; she’s found the KKK robe in his closet, even if she doesn’t yet know (as we now do, thanks to Looking Glass) that Judd was one of the leaders of the Seventh Kavalry. I love Will’s line to Judd about the KKK robe right before making him hang himself: “If you’re so proud of your legacy, why hide it?” But as satisfying as it may be to hear that line, the episode is clear that Will’s use of violence against his racist tormentors is not entirely a positive thing. When he kills the deli firebomber and the rest of the Cyclops organization in their meat warehouse, director Stephen Williams films it to look like a first-person shooter game or a mass shooting (neither of which are far removed from the Punisher, as you noted). The result of this massacre is the ruination of the Reeves family, and I’m reminded of “Moving Beyond Pain,” bell hooks’ critique of Beyoncé’s Lemonade: “Female violence is no more liberatory than male violence…Violence does not create positive change.” The same idea could carry over to black-on-white violence. Sure, the racists are dead, but what toll has that taken? Will’s horror at coming home that night to find his son dressing up like him is one of the most arresting scenes in the episode. On the one hand, we’re learning that Sister Night is the heir to the legacy of Hooded Justice, the first superhero and her grandfather. On the other hand, we also learn that Hooded Justice never wanted anyone to take after him, much less his own descendants. Even if superheroes started as a way to combat white supremacy, maybe they weren’t supposed to last forever. Then again, white supremacists have sure managed to stick around, haven’t they? On top of a Twilight Zone homage, the black-and-white coloring of this episode evoked the Rorschach masks worn by the Seventh Kavalry. Contrary to their simplistic racial worldview, this episode is all about uncovering history’s blurred lines and mysteries. Chance, you correctly noted that Hooded Justice was the creation not just of Will but also his wife June. What do you make of June being the figure to ultimately pull Angela out of her N-hole? Chancellor: It’s not surprising Angela developed some emotional connection with June while stuck in Will’s memories because of how they both view him. When Angela broke into the cultural center a few episodes ago and saw her family tree, she said to the holographic representation of Will, “Wherever you are, leave me the f— alone.” As we saw in the episode, June had a similar and even more visceral interaction with Will many years before. However, it appears as though they eventually did reunite because an older version of her is here in his memories. Perhaps, this is foreshadowing the fact that Angela has come around to her grandfather.

Plus, Dennis Quaid on finding love with a 26-year-old Last modified on Mon 25 Nov 2019 11.48 GMT Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories.  Michael Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former three-term mayor of New York City, has formally launched his late bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination with a $30m national TV ad campaign, in which he casts himself, one of the world’s richest men, as a “middle-class kid who made good”. The 77-year-old’s self-funded campaign will skip the first four primary states to make a play for the “super Tuesday” states in early March. ‘Existential threat.’ Bloomberg is reportedly running because of his concern that none of the existing Democratic candidates can defeat Donald Trump, whom he describes as “an existential threat to our country and our values”. Amy Klobuchar. The Minnesota senator, one of the more centrist candidates in the Democratic field, said on Sunday that her party “better not screw this up” by alienating independents and moderate Republicans. Any hope that congressional Democrats held of building bipartisan support for the president’s impeachment appears to have been dashed, with the GOP remaining united in its defence of Donald Trump. Despite a week of damning testimony, in which fresh evidence emerged of Trump’s misconduct over Ukraine, those Republicans who braved the Sunday shows stuck firmly to a series of pro-Trump talking points that are misleading at best. Navy secretary. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, has fired the Navy’s top official, Richard Spencer, over his handling of the controversial case of a Navy Seal accused of war crimes in Iraq, who had won Trump’s backing on Twitter. A set of classified internal documents, known as the China cables and leaked from within the Chinese Communist party, describes the workings of the network of prison camps that holds more than a million ethnic minority Uighur Muslims from the country’s north-western Xinjiang region. The documents also throw light on the surveillance technology being used by Beijing to monitor the same minority communities, both inside China and beyond its borders. Beijing responds. The Chinese embassy in the UK has responded to the leaked cables, calling them “fake news” and insisting “there are no so-called ‘detention camps’ in Xinjiang”. Hong Kong votes. After months of political and civil unrest, Hong Kong voters have delivered a “slap on the cheek” to their city’s Beijing-backed leadership, with landslide victories for pro-democracy candidates in the weekend’s local elections. The former Bolivian president Evo Morales has ruled out standing in his country’s next elections, to try to prevent the current unrest descending further into civil conflict. “In the name of peace, sacrifices have to be made and I am sacrificing my candidacy even though I have every right to it,” he told the Guardian’s Jo Tuckman in an interview in Mexico City, to which he fled following the “coup” that ended his 14-year socialist rule earlier this month. ‘Racist’ elite. At least 32 people have died in recent clashes between the Bolivian authorities and pro-Morales protesters, who are mostly poor and indigenous. Morales blamed the crisis on the country’s “racist and vengeful” old elite, backed by the US “empire in the north”. Taylor Swift won six American Music awards on Sunday night, including artist of the year and artist of the decade, taking her all-time total to 29 to surpass Michael Jackson’s record of 24. The former congresswoman Katie Hill, who resigned in October after the publication of nude photographs and allegations of an affair with a staff member, said on Sunday that rightwing media outlets attack women because “they’re easier targets” for bullying. The latest group of 32 US college students to be named Rhodes scholars is made up mostly of minorities, including the first transgender woman selected for the prestigious program. Prince Andrew is to withdraw his patronage from all 230 of the charities he currently supports, as part of the continuing effort to contain the public relations fallout from his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Florida nudist resorts split between purists and partygoers Pasco county near Tampa Bay is the nudist capital of the world, home to at least 13 nudist resorts and neighborhoods. But an ideological gap has opened up between Lake Como, the oldest and most traditional of the resorts, and the nearby Caliente Club, known for its wild swinger parties, as Jordan Blumetti discovered. Dennis Quaid: ‘I didn’t go looking for someone younger’ Dennis Quaid has long grown bored of talking about the cocaine addiction that landed him in rehab three decades ago. But now he’s in the tabloids for another reason: his engagement to a 26-year-old PhD student, Laura Savoie. And that, he tells Martha Hayes, he’s more than happy to discuss. Mass shooting leaves Fresno Hmong community shattered Last weekend gunmen fired into a backyard where friends had gathered to watch a football game in Fresno, California. Four people were killed, all of them members of Central Valley’s tight-knit Hmong community who, writes Sam Levin, came to California as refugees fleeing violence in south-east Asia. Wexit: Alberta’s push for independence Alberta, the oil-rich western province known as the Texas of Canada, has suffered years of recession and frustration with the federal government. Now a new party founded by an Alberta farmer is channeling those resentments into a push for secession, or “Wexit”, as Leyland Cecco and David Agren report. Facebook, Twitter and Google have vowed to “self-regulate” in an attempt to appear responsible amid forthcoming elections in the US and UK. But after years of shallow claims about their democratic potential, it’s clear the tech giants are in fact a major threat to democracy around the world, says Siva Vaidhyanathan. More than 60 countries will hold elections in 2020. Facebook and Google will be important variables in almost all of them. The third season of the US annual rugby competition, Major League Rugby, will kick off in February with three games over two weekends in Las Vegas. But despite some big new signings, there are rumours one of MLR’s founder clubs might leave to form a breakaway league, writes Martin Pengelly. Despite their 2-1 defeat by Manchester City, Chelsea’s midfield has been reinvented under Frank Lampard’s management, a turnaround to give their fans hope for the future. Arsenal’s 2-2 draw with Southampton, by contrast, was a disappointment that leaves Unai Emery’s future very much in doubt.

For the first stop of his Democratic campaign, Bloomberg went to Norfolk, where he criticized Trump over the firing of Richard Spencer. The civilian leader of the Navy said he could not in good conscience follow an order by the president to allow a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes to retire without losing his SEAL status. “The fact remains: We have a president, a commander in chief, who has no respect for the rule of law, and no concern whatsoever for ethics or honor, or for the values that truly make America great,” Bloomberg told a group of reporters at a downtown hotel. Virginia is a critical Super Tuesday state that is key to Bloomberg’s campaign strategy of bypassing early states to focus on the crush of states that vote later in the cycle. And the locale offered the billionaire and former mayor of New York City more than just the latest controversy in Washington to promote his platform. The neighboring city of Virginia Beach suffered a mass shooting on May 31 that killed 12 people at a municipal complex. Bloomberg, 77, said that such shootings have become “almost routine” and that “we have to put an end to this madness.” Gun control is a hallmark of Bloomberg’s political identity. His group, Everytown for Gun Safety, has pumped more than $6 million into Virginia campaigns alone in recent years to support like-minded Democrats, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Democrats retook both chambers in Virginia’s Legislature earlier this month. Bloomberg said it was proof that “with the right candidate, we can turn areas from red to blue.” Bloomberg, a centrist who became a Democrat last year, joined the presidential race Sunday, just 10 weeks before primary voting begins. His Democratic rivals have already pounced on his plans to rely on his personal fortunes to fund his campaign, accusing him of trying to buy an election. Bloomberg said Trump was a “threat to our country, to our values and our national security.” But he also cast doubt on the crowded field of Democrats whose performance, he insinuated, forced him into the race. “I think that there is a greater risk of having Donald Trump reelected than there was before,” Bloomberg told reporters. “And in the end, I looked in the mirror and said that I just cannot let this happen.” The former Republican touted a platform that also focused on combating sea-level rise, economic inequality and health care. He said he’s already beaten Trump in other arenas, at least symbolically, devoting tens of millions of dollars to pursue policy priorities that are in sharp contrast to the president’s. For instance, Bloomberg has helped shutter 282 coal plants in the United States and organized a coalition of American cities on track to cut 75 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2025.”I know what it takes to beat Trump because we already have, and I will do it again,” Bloomberg said.

Bloomberg also chatted with people at a diner in downtown Norfolk that was mobbed with reporters and at least some people who were eager to support him. Among them was Craig Schranz, 43, an emergency medicine physician who said he’s fiscally conservative and socially liberal like Bloomberg is.

336,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/magazine/alanis-morisette-jagged-little-pill-musical.html,"Feature The album was an emblem of young women’s anger in the 1990s. And now it’s coming to Broadway. Credit...Kelia Anne for The New York Times Supported by By Rachel Syme The Alanis Morissette song “Hand in My Pocket” is a list of opposites that aren’t really opposites at all, when you really think about it. “I’m short but I’m healthy,” she sings, in the half-yodel, half-dove-coo that people still channel in late-night karaoke bars. “I’m sick but I’m pretty, babyyyy.” Being petite has no bearing on a person’s hardiness, but of course, that isn’t the point. Morissette wrote the song — which became the fourth track on “Jagged Little Pill,” an album so popular at its height that it sold nearly half a million copies in one week — in less than an hour when she was 20. The lyrics are more affective than logical, more moody than meticulous. Morissette was showing that young people contain multitudes and that they are eager to describe — to themselves, to some distant, judgmental grown-up — their contradictory inner lives. Listening to the song 25 years later, as I did over and over one morning in May while waiting to meet Morissette at a resort an hour south of Los Angeles, was comforting, like an oversize, beloved cardigan that has grown a bit baggy in the sleeves. Still, taken as a whole, the album has undeniable power: It’s urgent and raw. It may be difficult to comprehend now, in the fractured world of streaming and microfandom, but “Jagged Little Pill” was once one of the biggest albums in the world. In 1996, the record sold more than 10 million copies; it has sold another 20 million since, according to Entertainment Weekly. To put it another way, this one album, written by a former teenage pop star from Canada, has sold as many copies as Taylor Swift’s entire discography combined. Morissette’s lyrics are funny and rebellious (it’s still electrifying to mouth the words “Would she go down on you in a theater?” from “You Oughta Know”), but they came packaged in high-gloss, catchy, grand ballads. She wasn’t just angry at an ex-boyfriend; she was slicing herself open with rage, interrupting his dinner to howl “you told me you’d hold me until you died, and you’re still alive.” Most of the songs on “Jagged Little Pill” began as a transcription of Morissette’s interior monologue while she was living alone in Los Angeles, spending a lot of time rollerblading on the Santa Monica pier. She had moved there from Ontario, where as a child she became first a television star and then a pop sensation. She began searching for collaborators, finally settling on the producer Glen Ballard, who had worked with Michael Jackson and Wilson Phillips. (“Ironic” was the only song whose lyrics they wrote together; the rest came directly from Morissette’s diary.) After a year, she and Ballard had a demo of unpolished, one-take recordings that they’d made late at night in Ballard’s studio. What happened next is the stuff of rock legend — a dozen labels rejected the demos, but then Guy Oseary, a 23-year-old A.&R. executive at Maverick (which was then Madonna’s label), heard “You Oughta Know,” “Perfect” and “Hand in My Pocket” and signed Morissette on the spot. A majority of the vocals on the album were drawn from the original tapes. Within six months of its release, it seemed as if “Jagged Little Pill” was playing on every radio station, all the time. The video for “Ironic,” in which Morissette portrayed four different versions of herself (wild, childlike, whimsical and determined) in four different outfits belting in a station wagon, ran on MTV several times a day. Both her voice and her look — long brown tendrils parted down the middle, blousy satin shirts or flannels and tight leather pants — were unmistakable and inescapable, widely imitated by her fans and parodied by “Mad TV.” She was the musical guest on “Saturday Night Live.” Rolling Stone put her on its cover with the headline “Angry White Female.” She was nowhere, and then she was everywhere. Morissette won four Grammys in 1996; Radiohead opened for her on tour. At the same time, she was subjected to withering condescension by both critics and other female musicians, who either labeled her an unhinged “banshee” or a varnished sellout. Her emphatic tone and lilting urgency are still sometimes viewed with a kind of knee-jerk disdain (recently Jezebel ran a viral post titled “Jagged Little Pill Is Actually Very Bad???” in which a writer argued that the album’s lyrics were jejune and best relegated to the dustbin of her youth; hundreds of commenters pushed back). But as I walked around the resort — where women were drinking chardonnay in the shade of giant succulents before noon — I wondered if the critics of “Jagged Little Pill” over the years have simply failed to understand the quality that made it a staple of road trips and impromptu group singalongs. The fact that it makes you feel perpetually 16 is not a drawback but rather its core appeal. All the tracks on the record, even the schmaltzy ones about falling in love, are tender and peeling at the surface like a sunburn. As “You Oughta Know” began to play in my earbuds and Morissette warbled that first, shaky “I,” I immediately felt a rush of dopamine to my brain. In its piercing tone and operatic overstatement, “Jagged Little Pill” remains a wonderfully transparent document of a young woman’s emotions, of her passion, of her capacity for catharsis. If her tone was singular then, it isn’t anymore. We live in a moment when women are fed up, openly, much of the time. Morissette’s register no longer sounds histrionic — it’s descriptive of a mood many of us recognize. And now the album will be ushered back into the mainstream by way of a new Broadway musical (written by the screenwriter Diablo Cody and directed by Diane Paulus, who won a Tony for “Pippin”), which will open on Dec. 5. When Morissette arrived in the resort’s “California coastal” restaurant, she was glowing and six months pregnant, wearing a fluttery white eyelet top, a pair of maternity jeans and sensible suede Newbark loafers. Though she was 45 and about to be a mother of three, there was something discordant about seeing a person who is practically synonymous with adolescent angst in this place, with its bungalows and golf carts and saltwater pools and the general vibe of a rehab facility for exhausted celebrities. Morissette explained that she was here to decompress after a recent move to Northern California. She had brought along her two young children, Onyx and Ever, and her husband, the rapper Souleye. She was finally done with living in Los Angeles, ready to be closer to her best friends, to Big Sur, to the redwoods, to skiing at Lake Tahoe. More people “un-school” their kids up north, she said. She was mentally preparing for a busy summer and fall. There was the baby, of course, and a new album — her first in eight years — would be coming out in the spring of 2020, right after “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical, whose development Morissette was intimately involved with. Glancing around the restaurant’s stuffy private dining room, which was dark and furnished like a sleek airport lounge, Morissette kept one hand on her belly, while the other one gestured gently to her publicist. She asked if I wouldn’t mind moving somewhere sunnier, maybe up to a suite, where we could order room service. The way she said this wasn’t divaesque, just matter of fact. Some rooms are inspiring; others are not. In the elevator on the way to our new location, Morissette asked me, in a soothing voice, if I had also felt a bad energy in the room. When I nodded, her eyes lit up. “So you’re also an H.S.P.,” she said. “A highly sensitive person.” Morissette has a calming, patient aura, like a therapist you’ve been seeing for years. She smiles widely and often, and you feel compelled to offer up confidences large and small: issues you’ve been working through with your mother, or how you’ve been off dairy lately. Her team refers to her in their communications by the unicorn emoji, and this feels apt: She has a fanciful, almost girlish lightness to her. [Read our review of an earlier production of “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical.] Upstairs, as we sat across from each other on opposing plush love seats with a floor-to-ceiling window beaming sunlight into our faces, Morissette told me that over the years, several producers had come to her with proposals to adapt “Jagged Little Pill” for the stage. But they always wanted to make a show about her life. “I have no desire to do a jukebox musical,” she said. Then Cody came to her with the idea that the songs from “Jagged Little Pill” could be used to chart the story of a contemporary family. After several workshops (which also included Paulus), the musical they created now touches on almost every climactic issue of 2019: opioid addiction, a queer woman whose mother won’t accept her, a white family butting heads with an adopted black daughter, a sexual assault and an ensuing #MeToo battle. It’s a lot to pack into one musical, but too-muchness is Morissette’s way. Though some people involved with the show had doubts about putting a high school rape onstage, Morissette believed the show could take on delicate issues like abuse and consent. “I’m not naming any names, but some people were really concerned, like ‘How are we going to back this up? This is a really huge subject,’ ” she said. “I said: ‘It’s me. How could I not back it up? I’m here.’ ” She assured the doubters that because this plotline came from her life, she would work with Cody and Paulus to make it sensitive and substantial. Morissette was actively participating in the creation of the show; during its initial run in Boston, she sat in the audience most nights, scribbling notes about how to deepen the relationships between the characters. I asked her how she even made it through the ’90s, when she was so exposed and often ridiculed for her candor. Morissette stared directly into my eyes. “Some part of me goes: I wasn’t dead because I’m Canadian, and because I’m therapy-minded, and because I will lose my [expletive] and sob for three hours in my hotel room and then feel somehow cleansed after that.” Then she got up to pace the room. Another explanation occurred to her. She clenched her jaw. “And it’s because I’m angry enough to survive. You know?” “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical, it should be said, is not a very angry show. Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of the caustic teenage-pregnancy comedy “Juno,” who wrote the book, felt that it was important to balance the album’s darkness with moments of whimsy. “Not the Doctor,” for example, now takes place in the context of a couple’s therapy session gone wrong. “Ironic” is set in a high school writing workshop: One character reads her poetry about “rain on your wedding day” to the class, and her peers pick her apart for the malapropism. To take Morissette’s oeuvre seriously, as Cody does, involves believing that she was always in on the joke — and that because she can laugh at herself, the moments when she breaks down feel more earned. Cody told me recently that working on the libretto for “Jagged Little Pill” made her fall in love with writing again. She had been going through a rough patch with screenwriting, feeling pushed to produce commercial pablum. “I come from garbage land, where everything exists to sell a toy,” she told me. We were sitting upstairs, on a summer afternoon, at the French restaurant Tout Va Bien in Midtown Manhattan. Cody has short black hair and was wearing a rockabilly-style vintage dress. She was in New York, with Paulus, to present a few numbers from “Jagged Little Pill” to the press. “Being able to work on something where people are talking about trauma and psychoanalytic concepts was very refreshing.” What Cody liked most was the opportunity to put new ideas into the show in real time, in much the same rapid-fire way that Morissette originally wrote the lyrics for the album. After the 2018 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., for instance, she wrote in a two-second reference about gun violence. “It’s not a show about gun control, and yet that moment is still in the show,” she said. “Because we just thought, This is something else that is [expletive] up.” Cody connected to “Jagged Little Pill,” the album, almost in spite of herself. She was a fan of riot grrrl music growing up (“I liked the kind of bands that would pull their tampon out and throw it at the audience”) but said that she was instantly drawn to the theatricality of Morissette’s words. “I can actually tell you the very first time I heard it,” she told me. “I specifically remember being in my bedroom, in the suburbs of Chicago.” She was 16 and tuned into Q101. “I remember the D.J. saying, ‘Wow, I am really excited to play this song.’ ” Cody said she always considered “Jagged Little Pill” to be a “concept album,” with a latent narrative stringing the songs together. It is one of the reasons, she said, that after three years of developing the musical, she is “still not sick of those songs.” From a plot perspective, Cody saw Morissette’s charge to update the album for 2019 as a call to maximalism; the show, she felt, should try to grapple with as many pressing cultural issues as it could in order to mirror Morissette’s own unbridledness. The first character Cody invented, a Connecticut housewife named Mary Jane Healy (played by Elizabeth Stanley), is a stressed-out mother who has become addicted to opioids after a car accident, an incident that triggers her memories of a college sexual assault. She won’t admit her dependency to her family — her husband, whom she no longer sleeps with; her Harvard-bound perfectionist son; her adopted queer black daughter — and she becomes increasingly isolated. “All I Really Want” is now sung by the whole Healy family at breakfast, as they talk past one another. Frankie, the Healys’ daughter (Celia Rose Gooding), sings: “Do I stress you out? My sweater is on backwards and inside out” as a provocation to her nit-picking mom. Throughout the song, she goads her mother while she makes activist posters to take to school, and then the number swells into a throng of students at a protest holding signs about reproductive rights and gender equality. On the original record, Morissette stops singing for a second in the middle of the song to make a point about how people fill silences with their own anxieties. “Here, can you handle this?” she sings. In the musical, the moment becomes the occasion for the Parkland reference: As Frankie sings these words, she holds up a sign that says “How Many More?” as an image of high school students participating in a lie-in protest is projected behind her. It’s not exactly understated, but neither is “Jagged Little Pill.” These issues demand in-your-face confrontation, the show seems to say. It’s an argument for abandoning nuance out of necessity. Paulus told me that the show started to come together for her when she realized it was less about razzle-dazzle and more about working through complicated questions in the form of song and dance. This may be why so much of the choreography, from Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, is jerky and tortured, as if the dancers are trying to crawl out of their own skins. They are mimicking Morissette’s movements when she first sang the album, those shimmying contortions that made her look as if she was actively sloughing off her demons. “Jagged Little Pill,” the album, reflects real loneliness and trauma. Morissette wanted me to know this, perhaps because at the time she was derided as a packaged studio creation, someone merely pantomiming a gritty persona. The songs in which she’s seething, she explained, were entirely authentic. When she was just 14, Morissette signed with MCA Records after she starred in the children’s television show “You Can’t Do That on Television.” The label promoted her as Canada’s answer to Debbie Gibson and Tiffany, but behind the scenes, she was experiencing depression and anxiety and felt older men were taking advantage of her. “I mean, I was flying alone when I was 10,” she told me. “I was going on a music-video shoot with four men to Europe when I was 14. I was always the one that everyone was like, ‘She’s going to be fine.’ Meanwhile, I’m like chewing my nails down to the quick and throwing up and having sexual-abuse stories all through my teens.” Though she worked with Ballard to craft her melodies, “Jagged Little Pill” was lyrically and vocally her own. “I mean, I was just writing about what I was thinking about and mulling over and ruminating, what I was tortured by or yearning for at the time,” she said. “Jagged Little Pill” most likely could not have existed outside its exact musical moment, cresting to popularity just after grunge tipped into the mainstream. Its crispy production borrowed from what was happening in Seattle (and fused that sound with sticky pop licks), but Morissette was far less punk-oriented in her ethos than either Courtney Love or riot grrrl bands like Bikini Kill, L7 and Bratmobile. Her success seemed to highlight the subtle difference between dirtiness and messiness in female performance. While Kathleen Hanna performed in ripped clothes and sold fanzines denouncing the “white male patriarchy,” Morissette performed in arenas and turned her anger into anthemic choruses — her messaging was accessible, easy to hum along with. For the female musicians who actively resisted being swept up by the industry, which was (and still is) mostly run by men, accessibility was a kind of betrayal (see Fiona Apple’s declaring “this world is [expletive]” from the stage of the MTV Video Music Awards, or Ani DiFranco’s refusing to sign to a record label she did not own). The riot grrrl ethos was “girls to the front” — a communal taking up space — while Morissette’s was more like “girls to your car,” where you could process your baggage in private. One was like being at a protest, and the other is like being in therapy — different impulses, but both about making conscious changes. Morissette’s music clicked quickly with the public: She was selling millions of records, touring the country and finding at shows that her fans had invented dance moves to go with “Hand in My Pocket.” But as soon as the album started climbing the charts, it was met with derision from some critics; even praise could be backhanded. When Rolling Stone listed “Jagged Little Pill” as one of the 100 best albums of the ’90s, it wrote, “Proof that the gods of rock are unfair bastards: A former TV moppet from the not-so-dirty North hooks up with Wilson Phillips’ producer and makes an opportunistic angst-rock platter that not only sells 13 million copies — it doesn’t suck.” Beyond snippy journalists, Morissette found she had an even harder time being accepted by her peers, despite the fact that several popular female musicians at the time were banding together for events like Lilith Fair. At the height of her fame, Morissette tried calling other successful artists on the phone to ask for advice, but she said she couldn’t break through. Even the women who came before her seemed to turn their noses up at her sudden rise. When Joni Mitchell was asked by Details magazine in 1996 to comment on the state of contemporary music, she responded, “It’s appallingly sick, for the most part,” and went onto disparage Morissette: “Alanis Morissette writes words, someone else helps set it to music and then she’s kind of stylized into the part.” Looking back on that time, Morissette told me: There were a lot of women “who were not sisterly or kind. Then over time, way less publicly, they would apologize, or they would take responsibility, or they would say, ‘I’m so sorry I said that.’ ” She continued, “I, naïvely, thought that fame was going to create this sense of connection ... and the opposite wound up being true.” Morissette may never have been outwardly political enough to bond with the riot grrrls — and her peers had legitimate reason to complain that their rebellion was being diluted by pop radio writ large — but she wasn’t necessarily trying to attract the kinds of fans who already bought zines and wore “Do My Nipples Offend You?” T-shirts. “Jagged Little Pill” functioned more like an invitation, allowing young women (and their fathers, and their mothers, and their second cousins) to tap into their rage in a way that they maybe would not have done without seeing her on MTV. The academic Sara Marcus, who wrote a book on the history of the riot grrrl movement, told the writer Allison Yarrow, the author of “90s Bitch,” that she may have been too quick to judge Morissette back in the day. “Some women aren’t aware of Hole, but they’re listening to Alanis Morissette,” she said. “Now we’re at a third-generation degraded copy, and at the same time, there’s an embrace of anger and obscenity that does something for people.” The culture Morissette came into was one in which female artists were regularly abused, and then sidelined, by male executives. Other women who came up during that time, like Liz Phair and Tori Amos, are now writing their memoirs and detailing how they were dismissed and objectified; in her recent “Horror Stories,” Phair writes about being stalked, screamed at and groped in the studio by her older male collaborators (her music was deeply informed, she writes, by “the treacherous waters of the male appetite”). If Morissette lacked subtlety in her lamentations about the abuse she suffered or the love she felt she deserved, it was because she wanted to be explicit. When she sang “You took me for a joke, you took me for a child, you took a long hard look at my ass, and then played golf for a while,” her message was impossible to ignore. Rhetorically, pop music has caught up with Morissette. So many hit songs now feature women excavating difficult moments from their lives and putting them on display: Kesha’s “Praying,” Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” Demi Lovato’s “Sober,” Lana del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness,” Adele’s “Hello,” Billie Eilish’s “Xanny,” the entirety of the Beyoncé album “Lemonade.” These artists might not cite Morissette as a direct influence, but “Jagged Little Pill” opened up a space in popular music for women to be performatively overwrought, and out of that surplus to find a searing lucidity. Morissette remains, to this day, one of the only artists who seem to invite singing like her when her songs are on: It is hard to hear “Hand in My Pocket” and not want to affect her singular and strange, almost Alpine voice. You become Morissette because what she is saying is less of a verbal transmission and more of a whole-body release. She gave voice to her own humiliation and abasement, and in re-enacting that, you may feel a bit humiliated yourself, like a teenager slamming a bedroom door. But it also feels generative. We’re all pissed as hell. Why be coy about it? The climax of “Jagged Little Pill,” the musical, happens during the second act, when a character named Jo (the phenomenal Lauren Patten), a queer high school student in a floppy beanie and a butch track jacket, sings “You Oughta Know” to the girl who left her to make out with a Harry Styles look-alike in her English class. Patten’s interpretation of the song is a slow burn; it starts as a whisper and ends as a wail. By the last chorus, she is teetering on the edge of the stage, practically vomiting up her words, beating at her chest in a pool of tomato-red light. Every time Patten performs “You Oughta Know” in the musical’s previews, she stops the show. This is not a euphemism; people get out of their seats at this exact moment. At first, Paulus and Cody were surprised by the interruption and tried to contain it with lighting cues. But people kept standing up. They’ve now built the applause into the run time. At the matinee I attended in November, the woman next to me sprang up before the song was even over, hollering through cupped hands as if she were at a hippodrome. I was so swept up in her enthusiasm that I, too, began to scream. There is something inherently dopey about a standing ovation in the theater — all that wriggling out of tiny velvet seats, all that collective emotion unleashed — but this one felt so eager and automatic that it transcended cheesiness. We were all cheering for Patten, who had wrung out her guts onstage, and we were cheering for Morissette, who created a song we have been humming for much of our lives. But also, I thought, as I glanced around the audience, many of us were also clapping for our younger selves, when we first blasted “Jagged Little Pill” in our bedrooms. As we sat down again, I thought I could hear a sigh of tenderness pass through the room, for the people that we used to be. Advertisement",2019-11-26 05:00:10,Alanis Morissette Isn’t Angry Anymore.

337,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/26/gun-violence-us-schools-database,"More than once a month in the past year, gunfire has turned deadly, gun control advocates find First published on Tue 26 Nov 2019 12.58 GMT A gun is fired on a school campus in America nearly twice a week. Suicide, homicides, a police shooting, attacks on students by other students: more than once a month this past year, gunfire on American school and university campuses has turned deadly, according to a database of school gunfire incidents compiled by advocates.  In the latest in a series of brutal shootings in California, and 11-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy were shot to death in the parking lot of an elementary school in Union City, California, in the early hours of Saturday morning. Police had no immediate motive for the shooting, but said that a suspect or suspects had fired into the van the boys were sitting in multiple times. Schools are one of the safest places for kids in the United States, and shootings in and around schools represent only a tiny fraction of the violence that children face here on a daily basis. But even the small amount of gun violence that occurs at American schools adds up. Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, at least 233,000 kids across 243 schools have been exposed to gun violence during school hours, a Washington Post investigation found. Experts are quick to put that number in context. Researchers found that nearly 1,300 American children aged 17 and younger die from gunshot wounds each year, and they are more likely to be killed in homes or neighborhoods than at school. Domestic violence is particularly deadly. In San Diego, a domestic violence mass shooting claimed the lives of three young boys and their mother, all shot to death by the boys’ father on 16 November, according to police. The fourth brother, nine-year-old Ezekiel Valdivia, died on Saturday afternoon, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. That single domestic violence shooting was deadlier than any of the school shooting attacks in the United States so far in 2019, according to tallies compiled by the Washington Post and the New York Times. “Gunfire on school grounds is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how gun violence affects children and teenagers,” said Ruhi Bengali, a senior associate at Everytown for Gun Safety, the country’s largest gun control advocacy organization. But tracking gun violence on school grounds, as Everytown has done since after the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, does provide a window into the many ways gun violence burdens young people, even in places that are “inherently meant to be safe spaces for learning”, Bengali said. Everytown’s analysis found that 20% of all gunfire on school grounds comes from unintentional shootings, but that even these “actually resulted in a fair number of injuries. Gun suicides, with no intent to harm anyone else, represented 12% of all incidents,” she said. As with other kinds of gun violence in America, students of color, and black students in particular, were disproportionately affected. Black students make up only 15% of the school population for K-12 schools, yet represented 24% of student victims in instances of gunfire on school grounds, she said. For the students affected by ongoing gun violence in and around their schools, local officials can offer additional counselors, but little evidence of national change on gun laws: Republican lawmakers have blocked any substantive gun control laws for the past quarter-century. In Union City, where the two kids were killed in the elementary school parking lot, students are out of school this week for the Thanksgiving holiday, but will have “district and community mental health providers available” when they return to school, spokesman John Mattos said. Not far away, students at Carl Munck elementary school in Oakland have also had additional counselors available to them. The president of the school’s Parent Teacher Association, Misty Smith Walton, was shot to death outside her Oakland apartment earlier this month. Her death wasn’t a school shooting. But that didn’t mean it does not affect the school. “She was always looking to improve her sons’ classes and their school, always there to do whatever was needed in the front office, on the yard or anywhere else on campus,” the superintendent said in a statement, calling her death a “horrific crime”.",2019-11-26 07:58:28,Scale of gun violence at US schools revealed by new database,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

339,https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2019/11/26/umass-boston-donations-el-paso-shooting-survivor,"By Arianna MacNeill   In the aftermath of the El Paso, Texas, Walmart shooting, a 9-year-old boy was recognized as a hero for helping his mom reach safety. And his bravery inspired a UMass Boston police officer to, in turn, help him. UMass Boston Lt. Clara Molina said she saw the interview Telemundo, a Spanish-language news station, did with Eduardo Gabriel Mier, who was in the store that day when a gunman opened fire. Twenty-two people died in the Aug. 3 shooting and another 24 were injured, but Eduardo and his mother, Ana Gabriela Vitela, escaped. “My mom froze. I yelled at her to go but she remained still,” the 9-year-old said. Eduardo then grabbed his mother’s hand and pulled her toward an emergency exit. In another interview, Molina said reporters asked the boy what he wants to be when he grows up, and he told them he wants to be a police officer and save others.   “That statement that he made there really touched my heart, and it was like, ‘I need to do something about it,’” Molina told Boston.com, noting that she also wanted to encourage Eduardo to follow his dream. Molina wrote a letter and sent it out to police departments in the area and also around the country, asking them for donations; the department also posted about the effort on social media. Over 50 police agencies sent gifts for Eduardo, including patches, hats, T-shirts, and coins. “We got a lot of very good responses,” Molina said, adding that the department also collected money to buy the boy an iPad.   Molina planned to fly down to Texas with Officer Matt Coviello on Nov. 10, but a family emergency kept her home; another officer went in her place. The El Paso police helped deliver the gifts to Eduardo, according to Molina, adding that he also got to go in a police cruiser. “The smile on his face when he opened the presents, I was in tears when I saw that,” Molina said. “We are proud of him, we recognize his bravery, and we want him to pursue his dream. If he wants to be a police officer, he can be a police officer.”   Molina said she hopes to meet Eduardo and his mom someday; she remains in contact with the family and wants to mentor the boy. Thinking back to why she pursued police work, Molina said it was a dream she had since childhood, noting that it’s how you treat people and “the compassion to people, that’s what makes a difference.” “When tragedy happens, people come together,” she said. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qklneGa15U  ©2021 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC  Stay up to date with everything Boston.

The reality is this is someone who said white supremacy is a hoax and why does Fox allow him to still be here in the first place?” Earlier this year and mere days after a white supremacist deliberately targeted Mexicans in the El Paso mass shooting that left 22 dead, Carlson took to his primetime show to claim white supremacy is “not a real problem” and a “hoax,” prompting calls for his firing. Hemmer, meanwhile, attempted to plow through, asking Blake to respond to Carlson’s opinion about Mrs. Obama throwing her hat in the ring while ignoring the New York assemblyman’s criticisms. “Not gonna happen,” Blake said about Obama running, before adding: “But I think the core question is he shouldn’t be on here at all.” “We get it,” Hemmer snapped back. “We didn’t bring you on to talk about Tucker Carlson but to talk about the Democratic field.” They would go on to talk about the presidential race for the next couple of minutes. The fireworks, however, were not completely over. After Blake took another shot at the network over its rhetoric and coverage, Hemmer stopped him short. “I didn’t bring you on to bash our network,” the Fox anchor said. “With all due respect, why don’t we keep it on topic?” “But it’s relevant,” Blake retorted. “No it’s not,” Hemmer fumed. “It is not relevant to the conversation we’re having. Save it for later.” In an interview on Tuesday evening, Blake told The Daily Beast that when he knew that Hemmer was going to ask about Carlson’s Obama prediction, he “decided that enough’s enough.” “The reality is that Tucker and Laura Ingraham and so many others over there continue to toss out ridiculous theories while simultaneously never being called out for their blatant racism and discrimination,” he said. Asked whether he thought Hemmer made a fair point when the anchor said he wasn’t going to let him bash the network, the New York lawmaker answered no. “I respect Bill and I’ve done interviews with him in the past,” Blake said. “There was one piece that was telling—when he said ‘save it for later.’ So you invited the vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee on Fox and you were surprised that I had criticism for Tucker Carlson and Fox? That by itself is pretty perplexing and surprising.” And as to whether he thinks Fox will invite him back on the air? “At the end of the day, you are a news network where you welcome different voices. There are many examples of times I have been on Fox enduring a barrage of attacks,” he concluded. “If they don’t invite me back because I called out the racism of one of their anchors, it speaks a lot about them and the network.” Contributing Editor Got a tip?

Little was clear Tuesday morning in Washington when authorities locked down access to both the White House and the U.S. Capitol. But it was clear to me what was probably unfolding: an aircraft had likely punctured the bubble of restricted airspace protecting Washington, D.C. I’ve been through dozens of these drills on Capitol Hill since 9/11. If you’ve been at this for as long as I have, you can usually divine what sort of security threat is afoot at the Capitol and how serious it may be. Some of it is “feel.” Some of it is observation. Some of it is the way authorities respond. LOCKDOWN LIFTED AFTER APPARENT AIRSPACE VIOLATION CAUSES DC SCARE I wasn’t in Washington on Tuesday morning. I was in Nashville for a wedding. I had just concluded a jog around Music City's version of ""Capitol Hill"" and the Tennessee state capital grounds word filtered through that there was a problem in D.C. A “universal” alert for both the White House and the Capitol usually indicates some sort of an incursion by air. But dozens of Congressional sources confided there were serious problems with alerting those who work on Capitol Hill, saying the response was “uneven” at best. One source on Capitol Hill even likened U.S. Capitol Police's handling of things to “Animal Farm"": Some people appeared to be “a little safer” than others. Several sources who work on Capitol Hill tell Fox they were warned that the Capitol complex and the surrounding buildings were “closed” and that no one could enter. Other sources who had already arrived for work were advised to shelter in place, lock the doors to their offices and remain inside. Fox is told some officers told those emerging from the Capitol South Metro Station just behind the Cannon House Office Building to head south. That’s good advice if a plane is coming in and they’re worried about people being near the Capitol. But it doesn’t do much good for people who weren’t alerted at all and were already inside the buildings. OFFICIALS STILL PUZZLED ABOUT 'HOVERING OBJECT' THAT PROMPTED LOCKDOWN IN DC “No good,” said one source. “This is a life and death situation.” Most appallingly, no one who works on Capitol Hill ever got any sort of electronic alert or alarm that anything was going on at all. Such alerts and advisories happen constantly if you work on Capitol Hill: Street closures due to protests or a malfunctioning road barricade. A suspicious package in the Hart Senate Office Building. On Monday, U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) issued an advisory regarding a “training exercise.” Officers direct passerby to keep at a safe distance from the U.S. Capitol Tuesday. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) “Small groups of USCP officers may be seen running to multiple locations and maintaining tactical formation. Again, this is only a training exercise,” announced a USCP advisory Monday night. It’s remarkable how many alerts go out about forgotten backpacks. Yet on Tuesday… nothing. Authorities weren’t sure if they had an actual, threatening aircraft bound for the Capitol on Tuesday, a gyrocopter (more on that in a minute) or someone’s hobby plane which strayed inadvertently into super-restrictive airspace after taking off from nearby Leesburg, Va. Congressional staffers trying to get to work didn’t know if they were facing another 9/11, a bomb, a chemical attack or a mass shooting. The security posture at the Capitol went to “Air Con Orange,” the status designating Washington is under threat from an incoming aircraft. “We were really scared,” said another Congressional source who asked not to be identified. “Even some information makes you feel better.” Complaints from angry and rattled Congressional chiefs of staff and even lawmakers themselves flooded the inboxes of Congressional security authorities. A coalition of dozens of House chiefs of staff fired off an angry missive to USCP Chief Steven Sund. “There were no corresponding alerts sent via email, text, PC pop-up window, audible alarm, siren, or verbal announcement to staff. This is highly problematic due to many of us and our staff already being in the building or in transit,” fumed the chiefs of staff to Sund. “Additionally, as of 1:00 pm, there was no corresponding ‘All Clear’ given.” The chiefs of staff then asked to know the current protocol for alerting people of threatening incidents at the Capitol. The chiefs also inquired what goes into triggering an alert and questioned how USCP will alert people when there is an incident. By midday, House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving released a memo explaining what happened – and issuing a mea culpa. Visitors are allowed to return to the U.S. Capitol Tuesday. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Irving told the Congressional community “there was a report of a possible aircraft in restricted airspace. In an abundance of caution, USCP began monitoring the situation for any potential threats, and as a result, access to the Capitol Complex buildings was restricted for a short time.” In his memorandum, Irving told the Congressional community they had to do better. “We acknowledge that communication must be improved, and my office and the USCP are working to refine communication protocols and alert systems during significant events, wrote Irving. Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger sent a similar missive to the Senate community. “If the incident had escalated requiring staff to take action, USCP was prepared to send out the appropriate messages,” wrote Stenger. That said, it’s still unclear whether an aircraft actually pierced restricted airspace encapsulating Washington. USCP scrambled a helicopter that circled the Capitol grounds. As is standard in the post-9/11 world, the Air Force dispatched jet fighters from nearby Joint Base Andrews. “We don’t know what the hell it was,” said one knowledgeable source, noting it could have been a “weather anomaly.” Fox was also told it may have been “geese.” This phenomenon is baffling because officials received information as to the location of the phantom craft, were told that it may have been “hovering” and were even given a readout on “knots,” measuring purported airspeed. People wait near the U.S. Capitol and congressional office buildings Tuesday. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Fox specifically inquired whether Capitol security systems may have been hacked, or, if this may have been a “test” by terrorists to judge how people may have responded. “That’s what they want us to do,” said one source familiar with Congressional security protocols. “Put our systems to the test, see how we respond and then plan around what we do.” Fox is told neither scenario of a possible hack nor a “test” was plausible in connection with this incident. This brings us back to the 2015 incident when disgruntled former letter carrier Douglas Hughes took off from Gettysburg, Pa. in a gyrocopter, little more than a flying lawnmower,  and headed for Washington. Hughes managed to land the gyrocopter on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol to protest big money in politics. There was almost no way to detect Hughes’s craft, let alone defend the Capitol against an incursion of this nature. It’s one thing to restrict massive aircraft to protect Washington against a 9/11 style attack with F-16s screaming through the air from Andrews. A smaller aircraft poses greater dangers. Put drones in that category. There’s a reason why “flying under the radar” is an idiomatic expression. It’s because, well, some things, like the gyrocopter, actually can “fly under the radar.” After the gyrocopter incident, security officials tinkered with “dialing up” the sensitivity of systems that protect the Capitol. However, there’s a problem with detection. Buildings in downtown Washington emit radiation. Flocks of birds soar over the National Mall. The systems are bolstered too much, they pick up everything – and not just the real threat. Over the years, USCP dramatically improved how they handle Capitol evacuations for possible air incursions. For a few years after 9/11, authorities used to simply dump all buildings on the Congressional campus, causing panicked people to sustain broken ankles and torn ligaments trying to flee. Flushing the buildings also presented another set of problems. Perhaps potential terrorists wanted an evacuation so everyone would dash into the streets. Then, a would-be-terrorist would start plucking off people with a high-capacity rifle or launch a chemical attack. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That’s why it’s sometimes better to shelter in place. Other times, it's better to run for your lives. The biggest takeaway from Tuesday’s incident is that it may have been a “tweener.” Officials weren’t certain what was up. That made it a challenge to make a hard call on what to do. The dearth of information looms large over this incident. And perhaps that’s because officials still don’t definitively know if they had a plane coming in or not.

342,https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/why-is-the-pulse-nightclub-shooting-getting-a-museum/,"On June 11, 2016, Omar Mateen, who had pledged allegiance to ISIS, killed 49 people at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. In the aftermath of the incident, a temporary memorial was set up. Last month, the onePULSE Foundation selected the winning design for the National Pulse Memorial & Museum. That’s right: In addition to a memorial, there will be a museum. While we can all agree a memorial is certainly appropriate, I was curious about the inclusion of a museum in the design program and dug deeper into what this was all about. First, I researched whether any other mass shootings in the past twenty years had created or proposed a museum. If there was, I couldn’t find them.  Why does the OnePULSE Foundation believe this shooting requires a museum? And this isn’t a small one-story museum either, it’s a spiraling tower, with vertical gardens, public plazas, and a rooftop promenade—nothing subtle about it. Beautiful event hosted by @onePULSEorg to unveil the design for the National @pulseorlando Memorial and Museum! The legacy of the 49 angels taken by hate will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come. Just WOW! 🏳️‍🌈#WeWillNotLetHateWin #ForThe49 #HonorThemWithAction pic.twitter.com/6AKTJqjwQp — Rep. Carlos G Smith (@CarlosGSmith) October 30, 2019  PJ Media contacted the foundation for more information, but no response was provided before this article was published. While the foundation’s mission statement is clearly worded to say the Pulse shooting affected the entire community, it also says it “was both a terrorist act and a hate crime” targeting the LGBT community. But while the shooter had pledged allegiance to ISIS, and the shooting was undeniably a terrorist act, when you read the onePULSE Foundation’s website, there appears to be a lot more focus on the implication that the shooting was an anti-LGBT hate crime. The credo “We will not let hate win” is repeated many times across the site. However, the shooting wasn’t about anti-LGBT hate. As Vox reported in April of 2018, “There’s now conclusive evidence that the shooter wasn’t intending to target LGBTQ people at all.” That evidence is explained in a motion on behalf of the shooter’s wife’s, Noor Salman, filed at the United States District Court, Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division.  Salman’s lawyers asked the court to rule as inadmissible the argument that Mateen targeted the LGBT community. “The veracity of Salman’s statements is the predicate for arguing that the attack on the Pulse nightclub constituted a premeditated attack on the gay community, as opposed to a random target selected by Mateen,” her lawyers wrote. “As such, the Government must assure the Court in advance that it intends to put forward facts and pursue a line of argument that Pulse was a premeditated target. References to an attack on the gay community have no foundation in the expected evidence and are therefore improper in the Government’s opening statement.” In short, Omar Mateen, after discovering a high level of security at his original target, looked for a random Orlando nightclub to target. As Vox noted, “This evidence dramatically changes the mass shooting’s narrative; politicians and individuals across the political spectrum had positioned it as an anti-LGBTQ hate crime. Instead, the new evidence suggests, the Pulse nightclub shooting was intended as revenge for US anti-terror policies abroad.” Despite this, the foundation appears intent on perpetuating the false narrative that the Pulse nightclub targeted by the shooter for being a gay nightclub. And the proposed museum will be the epicenter of that misinformation campaign.  According to the competition background information, the museum program will: That doesn’t sound like a museum about a terrorist attack inspired by revenge over United States anti-terror policies; it sounds like a museum about an LGBT hate crime that wasn’t. The foundation didn’t even attempt to be subtle in their Request for Qualifications (RFQ) from interested firms. In the RFQ, it is specifically stated that “Expertise on issues affecting the global LGBTQ+ community will be considered a plus.” This seems to blatantly contradict the mission statement that the mass shooting affected more than just the LGBTQ+ community. There’s something unsettling about the LGBT community trying to assume “ownership” of the shooting as an incident that affected them above all other communities. Could you imagine someone arguing that the 9/11 attacks was just an attack on New York, not the United States? The Orlando community absolutely should build a  permanent memorial to honor the lives lost and affected by the shooting, but the museum portion of the project seems intent on doing more harm than good with a mission based on a lie. While there are other memorials for mass shooting victims, there do not appear to be any other museums for mass shooting events. Why is the Pulse shooting different from other mass shootings that there should be an entire museum? Based on the materials provided by the foundation, it’s because they feel they have an opportunity to “have a conversation” with the community about anti-LGBT violence, even though that’s not what the Pulse shooting was. The shooting was a response to U.S. anti-terror policies overseas. The attack was an attack on America, not the LGBT community, and it’s shameful the way the onePULSE Foundation is trying to make it all about the latter.  _____ Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama’s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

343,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/27/syracuse-university-racism-campus,"More than a dozen hate incidents at Syracuse University in upstate New York have created a climate of fear among students – and tough questions for the school’s leaders Last modified on Mon 2 Dec 2019 16.21 GMT It’s a university, it says, for those wanting a “quintessential college experience”, and which touts its “gorgeous campus” and 150 years of history. But in recent weeks, Syracuse University in upstate New York – a five-hour train north of New York City – has been in the news for far less harmonious reasons: over a dozen hate incidents involving racist and antisemitic slurs have created a climate of fear for students and some faculty.  Nathena Murray, a sophomore, told the Guardian: “Just knowing that there’s people who have such hatred toward people who look like me … I have found myself having to look over my shoulder when I’m walking, be cautious with whom I’m sitting with.” Student protests against the university’s administration for not taking the incidents seriously and hesitating over broad diversity efforts have culminated in calls for the resignation of the school’s chancellor, Kent Syverud. Despite an investigation into the incidents by the school – which says it is doing all it can – and Syracuse police, the incidents have continued. The FBI has come in to help investigate. In the early hours of last Tuesday, students reported to campus police that they received a copy of the Christchurch manifesto – the document that was sent out minutes before the deadly mass shooting in New Zealand in March – while in the library via Airdrop. In order to receive an Airdrop, the sender and receiver have to be in close proximity. As word of the incident spread, students panicked. Various law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have said the Airdrop element was an unsubstantiated rumor – they have not been able to “locate a single individual who directly received an AirDrop”, though the investigation is still continuing. Hours before the alleged Airdrop, an anonymous user on GreekRank.com, a forum typically used by fraternities and sororities, posted the manifesto on Syracuse’s GreekRank page. “1488, Brothers and Sisters. Read up” read the post’s title, a number that represents an in-the-know nod to the white supremacist movement. The incident came as tensions on campus were intensifying. Among the incidents, anti-Asian and anti-black slurs were written inside multiple dorms. A swastika was drawn in a snowbank near campus. An antisemitic death threat was sent to a professor hours after the alleged Airdrop incident. Syracuse officials say they believe as many as five people could be responsible. An anonymous donor has offered up to $50,000 to anyone who comes forward with information. So far, students have been punished for one incident: four students and members of a fraternity were suspended after the university found them to be part of a large group of men who yelled the N-word at a black woman walking on a street near campus. But the perpetrators of all other incidents remain at large. The most recent report from the university’s department of public safety from 21 November – two days before the university closed for Thanksgiving break – said it was investigating four other recent incidents of racist graffiti. Syracuse University is home to over 22,000 students, all living within a three-mile radius. Like many smaller cities in upstate New York, Syracuse’s surrounding areas tend to lean conservative, and it’s not uncommon to drive out a few minutes from the city of 140,000 people and see Confederate flags and Maga signs in front yards. Tahliyah Tabron, a freshman, said that not knowing who was behind the attacks put her on edge. “It could be somebody that walks by me, it could be somebody that’s in my class. It could be somebody that lives on my floor. That’s the kind of thing that did instill some fear in me.” On a campus where black and Asian students each make up about 6% of the university’s student population and 8% of students are Hispanic, the attacks have felt personal. “Imagine walking into the bathroom and seeing I hate [N-word]. If you’re a black person, change that word to your name because that’s what it’s saying,” said Dumebi Enemor, a freshman. In October, Enemor said she overheard students watching a college football game on TV shout racist remarks at a black player. “ It’s not just in our heads,” she said. The attacks have spread to a faculty member, Genevieve García de Müeller, who received an antisemitic death threat to her work email. García de Müeller, who is Mexican and Jewish, said: “It got me really scared because it felt like they were very specifically trying to tell me that there was some threat to me as a person.” She added that the university administration was slow to make the incident known, sending out an internal email nearly 48 hours after she received the email and reported it to police. It took the chancellor two days to talk with her after she received the email. By then it was too little, too late. “My case is representative of how faculty of color are being treated on campus,” García de Müeller said. “They try to pretend these things don’t happen because it’s going to affect the way that people think about the university.” The hate speech on Syracuse’s campus coincides with a broader increase in hate crimes in the US. The university insists it is doing everything it can to investigate the incidents and stop them. But the recent incidents have challenged the leadership of the school’s chancellor, Kent Syverud, who has recently faced criticism for being a champion of free speech. He created a Free Speech Working Group in the spring and told faculty in a meeting in September that “if our students are going to learn or seek knowledge and grow, I think they need to be exposed to a true range of views”. In response to the string of incidents, Syverud said in a video statement that the recent incidents “are hate speech and not free speech”. Some students and faculty have echoed García de Müeller’s concerns and say they have been disappointed and angry with the administration’s handling of the incidents. They say leaders have been slow to act on and condemn them. Hundreds of students set up camp in the Barnes Center, a sports center, for an eight-day sit-in as part of the #NotAgainSU movement. Student protests culminated with a heated forum last Wednesday. Organizers gave Syverud until 7pm to sign on to a list of demands that included broad diversity and inclusion efforts. Syverud hesitated to sign a list of demands from #NotAgainSU, saying he could not promise to meet all of them yet. Chanting “sign or resign”, students marched to his off-campus residence several blocks away from the forum. Syverud signed the demands later that night. The #NotAgainSU students ended the sit-in the night after the forum but are still calling for Syverud’s resignation. They say he signed a revised version of the demands they did not agree to and missed their deadline. With many students gone for the Thanksgiving break, tensions on campus have eased, though the #NotAgainSU organizers say they will move forward with next steps after break. In a statement to the Guardian from Bea González, the university’s vice-president for community engagement and special assistant to the chancellor, said the university believes it has started to find common ground with protesters “on some of the key issues we’re facing”. She wrote: “We understand this has been a painful and unsettling time for many in our campus community as misinformation spread faster than facts and information. It’s important to note there has been no physical violence, nor has there been a threat against the physical safety of our campus community.”",2019-11-27 04:16:46,'It could be someone in my class': US university hit by hate incidents,,623382,http://www.theguardian.com/us

          / MoneyWatch A Charles Schwab charitable fund has stopped allowing customers to make donations to non-profits linked to the National Rifle Association through its $10 billion donor-advised fund. The decision to suspend contributions to charities linked to the gun owners advocacy group, which has not been previously reported, was made in the past few months. It comes at a time the NRA has faced a drop in donations, as well as allegations that it abused its non-profit status. Schwab's fund had donated a total of $146,000 to NRA-affiliated charities in its past three fiscal years, according to IRS filings. Attorneys general in the District of Columbia and New York have opened investigations into whether the NRA illegally transferred millions of dollars in tax-exempt payments from its non-profit, the NRA Foundation, to the parent organization. Donations made directly to the NRA would not qualify as tax exempt. ""The NRA strives to comply with all applicable regulations,"" NRA outside counsel William Brewer III said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. ""As we have stated on several occasions, the NRA is confident that its business practices enable its mission to protect Second Amendment freedoms."" Fred Kaynor, a vice president at Schwab Charitable, the independent non-profit that manages Schwab's affiliated donor-advised fund, told CBS MoneyWatch, ""Like other donor-advised fund providers, Schwab Charitable follows IRS guidance and suspends grants to [non-profit] organizations that are under investigation. In accordance with this policy, Schwab Charitable is not currently facilitating grants to 501(c)(3) public charities involved in the investigation of the NRA."" Kaynor did not say whether Schwab would lift the suspension on NRA-linked groups if the organization is cleared of wrongdoing. ""We are disappointed in Charles Schwab's decision, however, it has no material impact on the NRA, its affiliates, or our mission to protect the Second Amendment,"" said Andrew Arulanandam, managing director of public affairs for the NRA. ""Our members appreciate that, unfortunately, not every corporation is fully committed to our cause and freedoms."" Schwab is the most recent large financial firm, including Bank of America and Citigroup, to distance itself from the NRA and the gun industry following a rash of mass shootings. The NRA and other gun rights groups have criticized banks for refusing to process gun purchases or lend to gun manufacturers. City officials in San Francisco, where Schwab is based, passed a resolution in September that labeled the NRA a ""terrorist organization"" following a recent mass shooting there. The non-binding resolution called on the city and its agencies to limit their relationships with companies that do business with the NRA. Schwab declined to comment on whether the measure played a role in its decision. Wells Fargo, which is also based in San Francisco, has continued to lend money to gun companies as well as to a number of non-profit groups linked to the NRA. Schwab on Monday said it will buy rival TD Ameritrade for $26 billion. As part of the deal, Schwab is moving its headquarters to Westlake, Texas. Bloomberg reported last year that the NRA Foundation had an investment account at Charles Schwab. The brokerage firm said it does not disclose the identity of its clients, citing privacy concerns. Schwab offers one of the largest donor-advised funds in the country, which is run by an affiliate organization, Schwab Charitable. Donor-advised funds allow individuals to designate money for charitable giving and get a tax break without making an immediate donation. Individuals direct Schwab regarding what charities should receive their funds in its donor-advised fund. All of the money must eventually go to charity, but there is no limit on when donations must be made. Experts have criticized the practice, arguing that financial firms, which earn fees from managing the funds and facilitating transactions, have turned charitable giving into a for-profit enterprise. Schwab says that, while its donor-advised fund makes grants to charities specified by its clients, every grant made by the fund goes through a ""strict"" approval process. ""Schwab Charitable does not condone hate groups, and we take concerns about the illegitimate activity by grant recipients seriously,"" said Kaynor, who also dismissed the idea that the firm makes money off its donor-advised fund. ""The amount of support Charles Schwab & Co. provides to Schwab Charitable is far greater than any fees Charles Schwab receives for investment management."" Other donor-advised funds managed by large financial firms have also directed large donations to groups tied to the NRA. The Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund, which is the largest donor-advised fund in the nation, donated nearly $375,000 to NRA-linked groups in its past two fiscal years, according to IRS documents. Like Schwab, Fidelity said it is generally up to clients where the money in its donor-advised funds goes. But the company will not donate to charities that are currently under investigation by either federal or state authorities, as is the case with the NRA and its affiliated charities. A Fidelity spokesperson declined to say whether the company was still facilitating donations to NRA-linked charities. An official at the National Philanthropic Trust, which is part of an advisory group of the largest donor-advised funds, said Schwab officials recently contacted the organization about the brokerage's decision to suspend grants to the NRA. The NPT official said he has not heard of other funds making the same decision, and that its advisory group, which meets regularly, has not discussed the issue.

He was supposed to decorate the Christmas tree with his mother after Thanksgiving dinner – their annual ritual – and celebrate the holidays with his newborn nephews. Instead, his mother spent the weekend giving away baskets of Thanksgiving food in Jerry's honor. ""Holidays aren’t the same anymore,"" Jerry's mother, Maria, said. Jerry Wright was one of 49 people shot and killed at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 – and just one of the hundreds of people who've died in mass shootings in recent years. ""I would do anything to have my son back. It’s been three and a half years, and I miss him every single day,"" Wright said. ""They say time heals, but it doesn’t heal this."" For survivors living in an age when society has grown numb to a seemingly endless loop of mass shootings, the holiday season can feel particularly painful. Times of intense triggers about the loss of a loved one are more likely to happen around anniversary times, when another shooting happens, and during the holidays, said Robin Gurwitch, a professor and psychologist at Duke University Medical Center. During those times, some survivors turn to faith. Sharon Risher lost her mother, two cousins and a childhood friend in 2015 when a white supremacist killed nine people at a bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. ""I light candles on their birthdays. I have a special place in my room I call my faith corner. On Christmas, I’ll say a prayer,"" she said. For Sari Kaufman, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last year's shooting still feels surreal – a former student opened fire at the high school, killing 17 students and staff and wounding 17 others. ""All the emotions are so raw even two years after,"" Kaufman, 17, said. ""Getting our diplomas, and graduating, and getting our cap and gown and knowing that ... I think some of my friends still haven’t processed everything."" Mass shootings: Including El Paso and Dayton, there have been 112 people killed in mass shootings this year. Since 2006, nearly 1,800 people have died in a mass shooting in the U.S. (defined as a shooting with at least four fatalities, not including the suspect), according to the USA TODAY/Associated Press/Northeastern University mass killings database. Other databases track more shootings and cite higher totals. In 2019 alone, there have been 32 mass shootings and 170 fatalities – the most mass shooting incidents in more than a decade, according to the database. Many more victims have been psychologically scarred. ""There’s so many happening that we’re beginning to forget,"" Wright said. ""Somebody told me recently that there’s so many they all begin to run together. And that’s the biggest tragedy."" Wright said that when she hears about another mass shooting, she can't bear to watch the news coverage. ""It puts me right back. I know exactly what those parents or loved ones are going through,"" Wright said. ""I don’t want to take away from the mother whose son dies in her arms when he goes to take out the trash. Those stories are just as terrible as mine. But in a mass shooting, this horrible thing happens to you in such a public way."" El Paso mass shooting: Walmart unveils memorial for victims For Risher, news of shootings that affect minority groups, in particular, hurts the most. ""In my black experience, in being a minority – the (Tree of Life) synagogue shooting, it hurt,"" she said. ""When it really gets to hate crimes, then that hits home even more because now you’re part of a minority of a minority. We have subsections of mass shootings. Is that not crazy?"" Risher had been on a speaking tour about the Charleston shooting when she heard the news about Parkland. ""I thought I was going to die,"" she said. ""... When I saw that it was the school, I felt like someone hit me in the chest with a hammer."" School shootings strike a particular chord for Kaufman. Earlier this month, a shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, left three teens dead, including the gunman. ""When I saw the Saugus school shooting, it brings me back to everything on the day – how the news reports come in, the interviews,"" she said. ""We completely lost our innocence that day."" Many survivors have found solace in a range of online and offline support groups. Wright participates in the survivor network with the nonprofit Everytown, which advocates for gun control. She's also in two Whatsapp chats – one in Spanish, and one in English – for the ""Pulse moms."" ""We try to support each other. Sometimes there’s no one else who can really get it. It’s kind of ironic because none of us knew each other until our children were killed together,"" Wright said. Las Vegas victim dies: Deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history Wright said she's met many other survivors through the network and her own organic chain of relationships, including a mother who lost her 17-year-old son in the Parkland shooting. ""This is so sad that you can now have someone mentor you through this process. But I’ve been there to be an ear, be a shoulder and remind her that she needs to take care of herself – that yes, nightmares are part of it,"" Wright said. Risher, similarly, has become close to a survivor of the shooting that claimed 22 lives at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, this past August. On Friday, residents shed tears and prayed during a ceremony unveiling a memorial dedicated to the victims. ""The survivors, when we’re together, you know that these people have been through something horrific. It is the loneliest club you don’t want to be a part of,"" Risher said. Young people, in particular, will channel their trauma into activism, Gurwitch said. The Parkland students have gained worldwide attention for speaking out against gun violence and organizing school walkouts. ""Sharing my story constantly – some people have vivid flashbacks – but I see it more as a coping mechanism for me,"" said Kaufman, who has spent nearly the past two years organizing voter registration drives and speaking at events about red flag laws and universal background checks. Kaufman said that, about a year ago, she met with some survivors of the 1999 Columbine, Colorado, shooting. ""It was interesting but frightening to see that, 20 years out, the emotions don’t leave you,"" she said. ""But also, it was inspiring to hear that they are still working on gun issues and mental health care."" Kaufman, Risher and Wright said they plan to continue working on gun violence issues. Kaufman plans to study political science in college and run for office one day. Risher wrote a book about the Charleston shooting and continues to speak about what happened there. Wright said she tries to raise the issue of gun violence with everyone she meets. She's worked on a podcast about life after losing Jerry and on a music video with musician Michael Franti. She'll even bring up the issue to the person waiting next to her in line at the grocery store. ""When you choose to be the voice your child no longer has, on the one hand, it is empowering and you do feel like you’re honoring your child. But it also makes it very hard when these things keep happening,"" she said. ""When people find out, they always say ‘I can’t imagine.’ But I wish for a moment everybody could imagine it. Then we would have found a solution by now."" Jerry won't be at the dinner table Thursday, but Wright said she's still giving thanks for the time that she did have with her son. ""It’s sometimes very hard to see the positive and stay grateful,"" she said. ""I did have the blessing of having him for 31 years, and I tell myself that."" Resources The National Child Traumatic Stress Network at nctsn.org provides a variety of resources regarding school and mass shootings. The National Center for PTSD at ptsd.va.gov and the National Alliance on Mental Illness at nami.org provide mental health resources. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357), provides confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders.

347,https://www.ocregister.com/2019/11/27/politics-of-immigration-add-stress-for-many-latinos-and-leave-them-wary-of-seeking-help/,"Trending: Dr. Luis Garcia glanced at his watch, sighed and tapped the mic. It was 10:20 a.m., 20 minutes past the scheduled start, and it was clear that this Saturday’s workshop — talking about the psychological risks of being an immigrant — would not be well attended. Garcia looked up from the podium, scanned the approximately 200-seat auditorium at MemorialCare Long Beach Medical Center, and saw just seven people, most of whom were sitting in the back. “Buenos dias… Good morning!,” Garcia said. “We’re going to start in about five minutes. “I apologize for taking so much of your time,” he added. “I don’t know why there aren’t more people here.” Actually, he did. The same political and cultural trends that are creating an epidemic of stress-related health woes in the Latino communities of Southern California — everything from rising pre-term birth rates to widespread depression to little kids diagnosed with PTSD — also are making many people wary of venturing out in public. Cowed by the threat of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, harsh changes in immigration policies, and racially motivated violence (such as the recent mass shooting at a Wal-Mart in El Paso), some Latinos are avoiding contact with anybody who might be deemed an authority, according to Garcia and other leaders of public mental health programs. That wariness extends to seminars, health fairs and other gatherings that might improve their health. Garcia, vice president of quality care for the nonprofit health network Pacific Clinics, said attendance has fallen by half at some of the workshops he holds. But the need for those classes — which offer information about mental health problems and how to seek appropriate treatment — is real and growing. Garcia said those who do come to his events include a growing number of adults suffering from serious mental health disorders and substance abuse, and parents who say their kids are depressed, anxious or suicidal. But when he gives out contact information to get some help, Garcia said, many are too scared to follow up. “The first thing they’ll ask is: ‘Will I be safe if I go to you for services? I don’t want any problems.’ They ask a lot of legal questions,” Garcia said. “And you can see the main issue is they are so afraid.” Latinos have long been reluctant to seek care for mental health problems, and that reluctance has soared since the 2016 election of President Donald Trump, several health providers said. People who are undocumented, and others who are citizens but have family members without legal status, worry that contact with a public health clinic means their information soon will be shared with immigration authorities, even though providers say such information is protected.  And the Trump administration’s “public charge” rule — a proposal that’s currently on hold but, if implemented, would penalize Green Card applicants for using certain public benefits — is scaring off many legal citizens from seeking mental health care for themselves or their U.S. citizen children, providers said. This mistrust couldn’t come at a worse time. Numerous studies have tracked a spike in stress-related health problems in the Latino community since the 2016 election. A study in JAMA Pediatrics, which looked at nearly 400 U.S.-born Latino teens with immigrant parents, found they had higher-than-normal levels of anxiety, higher blood pressure and more trouble sleeping. Another study found an unexpected surge in preterm birth rates among Latina mothers. Other surveys by The Children’s Partnership and California Immigrant Policy Center detected greater anxiety and fearfulness among Latino parents and their children. These fears are pushing immigrants to isolate themselves and their children, further undermining their mental well being, experts said. “It’s a double bind,” said Gloria Montiel, a strategic consultant with the Santa Ana-based nonprofit Latino Health Access. “There is an increased need for mental health services, and real preoccupation (within) the community.” Montiel’s organization works to provide mental health treatment to people in Orange County, offering help that ranges from an on-site, Spanish-speaking therapist to assistance in navigating the healthcare and legal systems. Part of the agency’s work involves face-to-face outreach, she said, but even that is hampered by fear. “People are really hesitant to even open the door,” Montiel said. “It’s becoming harder to convince them… that we’re not reporting their information (to immigration authorities),” she added. A similar phenomenon played out last year at an event in Bell Gardens put on by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. The event, aimed at the area’s Spanish-speaking community, promised a Zumba class, free haircuts and more than 100 vendors. But when the day came, and turnout was shockingly low, organizers asked the few people who did attend why other Latinos in the area didn’t come. “People said they don’t want to come out of their house,” said Ana Suarez, a health program director with L.A. County Dept. of Mental Health. “We had more vendors than we had attendees,” Suarez added. “It was really sad. It was like having a big birthday party and nobody shows up.” Some elements of this dilemma pre-date current politics. Among older Latinos, for example, mental health issues carry a stigma, prompting many who suffer to deny the problem. And some people, particularly first-generation immigrants, simply don’t have the vocabulary to describe mental distress, said Sergio Aguilar-Gaxiola, director of the UC Davis Center for Reducing Health Disparities. The Mexican indigenous language Mixteco, for example, doesn’t have a word for “depression,” he noted. Those factors, combined with a severe shortage of bilingual and multicultural mental health providers, can make it harder to get proper treatment. Patients sometimes show up at a doctor’s office complaining of physical symptoms, such as body ache or fatigue, when in fact they’re suffering from depression or PTSD. “If the providers are not well trained on psychiatric issues, it will take them some time to diagnose what the problem is,” Aguilar-Gaxiola said Without treatment, mental health conditions intensify over time, he added, leading to problems that can ripple through their lives. “It interferes with their work, with their relationships with family and friends and co-workers,” he said. “It limits people’s ability to reach their potential.” Despite the challenges, Latino outreach is ramping up. Sometimes, the message is simply telling people that mental health treatment isn’t connected to immigration enforcement, and that seeking treatment isn’t a threat to staying in the United States. Suarez, with Los Angeles County, said her agency has been asked by community groups to send in promotoras — Spanish-speaking health workers — to teach a class about the connection between trauma and immigration issues. The broader goal, she said, is to help handle the growing crisis in the Latino community. Suarez and others who work in the field also said the health promoter, or “promotora” model, which is common in many Latin American countries, remains an effective way to reach some Latino communities. Promotoras are not mental health providers. But, because they speak Spanish and tend to be well-known within the community, they can be effective health messengers. Laura Olvera Arechiga, a promotora with the non-profit Vision y Compromiso, said she and three other outreach workers in Riverside County will hold public workshops to address stress, depression, anxiety, trauma, violence and suicide prevention. Arechiga, who is originally from Mexico, has worked as a promotora for asthma prevention but said many of the people she helps also struggle with mental health problems. Montiel, with Latino Health Services in Santa Ana, said her group is trying to partner up with trusted institutions, such as schools and churches, to spread the word about the help they can provide. The organization, she added, also has contracted an on-site therapist so that community members who are fearful of going to a mental health clinic can get counseling at their offices. In the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, the county recently launched a range of services — knitting, Zumba, hiking — to help get out the word about mental health to the Latino community. Diego Rodrigues, chief operating officer with Alma Family Services, which runs the program, said the idea is to create a non-threatening space where people can talk about mental health and also have fun. “The whole purpose is to destigmatize mental health, and think of mental health as just wellness, which the whole community can benefit from.” Meanwhile, Dr. Garcia with Pacific Clinics continues to speak at mental health outreach events, even when the audience is small. “For me, it’s very clear… I have to go and talk with people,” he said. “I want to avoid any tragedy, keep these kids and their families safe, and encourage them to do the prevention that they need to do.” Claudia Boyd-Barrett writes for the Center for Health Reporting at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics.

349,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/11/27/kendrick-castillo-mother-speaks-stem-school-shooting/,"Trending: At 12:50 p.m. on May 7, Maria Castillo texted her son, Kendrick, at school, asking when he would be home. When she didn’t receive a reply, she called. And called. And called. But her 18-year-old boy — a teenager who loved robotics, fishing and the outdoors — never came home. “My life is over. I don’t have a life,” Castillo told a Douglas County judge on Wednesday morning through an endless stream of tears. “He was my life.” Castillo described the unbearable anguish of losing her only child during the final day of a legal hearing that will determine whether a 16-year-old accused in the killing will continue to be tried as an adult or whether his case will be sent back to juvenile court.  Just a few feet away, Alec McKinney, the defendant, cried as Castillo talked. For the past seven days, McKinney’s public defender and prosecutors from the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office have presented witnesses and made their arguments as to which court the 16-year-old’s trial should be held and if convicted, whether he should be housed in a juvenile or adult prison. Douglas County District Court Judge Jeffrey K. Holmes will rule on Dec. 4 via written order. Defense attorney Ara Ohanian promised that his client would plead guilty if the case was returned to juvenile court. District Attorney George Brauchler argued that a teen who planned a mass shooting for weeks deserves to be tried as an adult. Kendrick Castillo’s mother was the last witness in the hearing, and it was the first time she has spoken publicly since her son was killed and eight others were wounded in the shooting at STEM School Highlands Ranch. Maria Castillo said she drove to the school on May 7 after her husband, John, told her there had been a shooting. Kendrick wasn’t there so she drove to a hospital where she met with a doctor. “The doctor said, ‘I’m sorry,'” Castillo said. She didn’t know what that meant. “He didn’t make it,” the doctor said. “He’s dead.” Castillo punctuated her responses with tears and sniffles, recalling her boy as the “best son you could ask for.” Classmates have said Kendrick was the first student to leap from his desk and tackle a shooter in their classroom. Others who joined him in the fight also suffered gunshot wounds. “I don’t want to eat. I don’t want to sleep. I don’t want to work,” she said. “I wish I could trade places with him.” Maria and John Castillo go to Kendrick’s grave every day. They go in the cold. In the snow. In the rain. “I tell him, ‘Goodnight,'” Maria Castillo said. “I tell him I love him.” In closing arguments, Ohanian described the death and destruction at STEM as a tragedy. He never argued that his client was innocent but said McKinney deserved “a chance at a second chance.” He described a child born into a home full of domestic violence, drugs and alcohol. McKinney suffered from an absentee mother and a system of mental health providers and the Department of Human Services that let him fall through the cracks, Ohanian said. “Alec can redeem himself,” Ohanian said. Brauchler summarized the prosecution’s arguments Wednesday, saying McKinney planned the shooting in advance, did not hesitate during the “heinous act” and showed no remorse afterward. The district attorney also noted McKinney has admitted to lying to medical professionals, his family and teachers about his drug use and homicidal thoughts. “What message would be sent to the community, to other adolescents, if this case is sent to juvenile court?” Brauchler said. After the hearing, John Castillo told reporters that it is important to the family for McKinney to be tried as an adult. “Just because juveniles are looked upon as being young doesn’t mean that they don’t have the capacity to do mass homicide shootings and domestic terror,” he said, adding that lawmakers need to consider tightening the books on juvenile offenders. “We have to wake up to that, and that’s why this is so important. We need to set precedents.” The Castillos did not miss a minute of testimony during the seven hearings, taking their customary seats every morning near the front of the court room. Day after day, they listened to attorneys outline the actions of a teenager sitting just feet away, someone charged with sparking the actions that killed their son. “I look over and I keep looking for empathy, some type of human emotion,” John Castillo said of McKinney. “And I hate to say it, but I see crocodile tears.” Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts",2019-11-27 18:25:44,“He was my life:” Kendrick Castillo’s mother speaks for the first time about losing her son in STEM School Highlands Ranch shooting,,390346,http://feeds.denverpost.com/dp-news-breaking
350,https://www.monstersandcritics.com/true-crime/hamilton-avenue-murders-saw-desmond-turner-and-james-stewart-massacre-a-family-of-7/,"Home » TV » True Crime The crime that unfolded at 560 North Hamilton Avenue in Indianapolis on June 1, 2006, is still remembered as the worst mass shooting in city’s history. A terrible incident that left 7 people dead, including 3 children. They were the members of a working class family who were honest and hardworking, victims of James Stewart and Desmond Turner, two criminals who mistakenly thought the family were hoarding a large quantity of cash and drugs. Shortly before 10 pm on the night of June 1st, witnesses saw Turner and Stewart enter the property, carrying military style weapons they massacred everyone in the house. The victims were: Alberto Covarrubias, 11; David Covarrubias, 8; Luis Albarran, 5; Flora Albarran, 22; Emma Valdez, 46; Alberto Covarrubias, 56; and Magno Albarran, 29. Three generations of a family were destroyed. On hearing shots neighbors dialed 911, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Kermon was first to arrive at the scene. He found Flora Albarran (mother to shot Luis Albarran) crying in the street, she was pointing at the house shouting “they’re shot.” Kermon discovered a ransacked house, with bodies lying throughout the home, and spent casings on the floor. The victims had been shot at close range. Stewart was arrested the following day without incident, however, a massive manhunt involving local, state, and federal authorities was launched for Turner. Two days he was found with relatives at a fast-food restaurant, here he surrendered to police. The death penalty was initially sought for Turner, however, in exchange for pleading guilty he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead. Stewart, an habitual offender, was sentenced to 425 years. Jasmine Albarran, who’s father Magno was a victim, has spoken out about the devastation that the crime caused, and her struggle to come to terms with what happened. Police Officers who worked the case have spoken about how deeply affected they were by the slaughter of this family.

Blanchard, 19, had gone missing on Oct. 23. She was last seen on surveillance footage in an Auburn convenience store on the night she went missing. The case will now proceed as a homicide investigation, a statement released by the Auburn police department said. According to Lee County District Attorney Brandon Hughes, upgraded charges are possible once the cause and manner of death are confirmed after medical examination.  Blanchard’s remains were found by the Auburn police in a wooded area in Macon County, southwest of Lee County. Two suspects,  Ibraheem Yazeed, 29, and Antwain Shamar Fisher, 35, were arrested in connection to Blanchard’s disappearance after her vehicle was found abandoned with her own blood inside in Montgomery. A witness at the convenience store had seen Yazeed forcing Blanchard into her car against her will. The blood in the car was “indicative of someone suffering a life-threatening injury,” officials stated in the affidavit. Both Yazeed and Fisher have been charged with first-degree kidnapping and are being held in Lee County jail. A third suspect, David Lee Johnson Sr., 63, has been charged with hindering prosecution. The step-daughter of the UFC star studied at the Southern Union State Community College, which has multiple campuses in East Alabama. Auburn Police Chief Paul Register said that her family was heartbroken, but they can now begin to deal with the situation and move forward. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said that she was heartbroken for Blanchard’s family. “Like Alabamians across our state, I was praying for a much different outcome. I will be keeping them in my prayers and ask the people of Alabama to continue to do so as well,” Ivey said in her statement.  Blanchard’s college tweeted a message saying their worlds seemed dimmer and their hearts heavier on hearing the news about Aniah.

352,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/29/iraq-in-turmoil-as-45-shot-dead-by-security-forces-in-protests,"Deaths follow torching of Iran’s consulate in a challenge to Tehran’s power and influence on its neighbour Iraqi security forces have shot dead at least 45 protesters after demonstrators stormed and torched an Iranian consulate in Najaf, in what could mark a turning point in the uprising against the Tehran-backed authorities. At least 29 people died in the southern city of Nassiriya when troops opened fire on demonstrators who blocked a bridge before dawn on Thursday and later gathered outside a police station. Police and medical sources said dozens of others were wounded.  Four people were killed in Baghdad, where security forces opened fire with live ammunition and rubber bullets against protesters near a bridge over the Tigris river, the sources said, and twelve died in clashes in Najaf. In Nassiriya thousands of mourners took to the streets, defying a curfew to bury their dead after the mass shooting. Video of protesters cheering in the night as flames billowed from the consulate were a stunning image after years in which Tehran’s influence among Shia Muslims in Arab states has been a defining factor in Middle East politics. The bloodshed that followed on Thursday was one of the most violent days since the uprising began at the start of October, with anti-corruption demonstrations that swelled into a revolt against authorities seen by young demonstrators as stooges of Tehran. While many of the protests focus on domestic issues, like corruption and lack of job opportunities, the post-Saddam years have seen Iran embed itself in nearly all aspects of Iraqi governance. Since the withdrawal of US forces in 2011, Iran has consolidated itself not only in Iraq, but in Lebanon, where Hezbollah plays a dominant role. In Syria, Tehran’s war against Isis allowed its proxy forces to establish footholds. Following the violence in Iraq, Iran closed the Mehran border crossing on Thursday night for security reasons, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported, citing a local border official. “With attention to the recent events and the unrest in the country of Iraq the Mehran border has been closed from tonight,” Mojtaba Soleimani, the manager of the border post said, according to Mehr. He said it was not clear when the border would reopen. In Najaf, a city of ancient pilgrimage shrines that serves as the seat of Iraq’s powerful Shia clergy, the Iranian consulate was reduced to a charred ruin after it was stormed. The protesters, overwhelmingly Shia, accused the Iraqi authorities of turning against their own people to defend Iran. “All the riot police in Najaf and the security forces started shooting at us as if we were burning Iraq as a whole,” a protester who witnessed the burning of the consulate told Reuters, asking not to be identified. Another protester, Ali, described the attack on the consulate as “a brave act and a reaction from the Iraqi people. We don’t want the Iranians.” But he predicted more violence: “There will be revenge from Iran, I’m sure. They’re still here and the security forces are going to keep shooting at us.“ Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack and demanded “the Iraqi government’s firm response to the aggressors“. So far, the authorities have been unyielding in response to the unrest, shooting dead hundreds of demonstrators with live ammunition and tear gas, while floating proposals for political reform that the protesters dismiss as trivial and cosmetic. The prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has so far rejected calls to resign, after meetings with senior politicians that were attended by the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, the elite unit that directs its militia allies abroad. Abdul Mahdi on Thursday summoned a senior military commander in Dhi Qar province, where Nassiriya is located, to Baghdad to explain why the situation had deteriorated, a military statement said. The military commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of paramilitary groups whose most powerful factions are close to Iran, suggested the unrest in Najaf was a threat to Shia clergy based in the city. The paramilitary fighters would use full force against anyone who threatened Iraq’s most senior Shia cleric, grand ayatollah Ali Sistani, commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said in a statement posted on the PMF website. “We will cut the hand of anyone trying to get near al-Sistani,” he said. The influential populist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr issued a fresh call for the government to resign, while warning those who torched the consulate that they risked provoking a violent backlash from the authorities. “Do not give them cover to end your revolution, and stay clear of religious sites,” he said in a statement on Twitter. If the government does not resign, “this is the beginning of the end of Iraq,” he said.",2019-11-28 20:24:01,Iraq in turmoil as 45 shot dead by security forces in protests,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
353,https://www.nationalmemo.com/struggling-nra-gave-big-raises-to-executives/,"The National Rifle Association has had a bad couple of years, hemorrhaging membership, money, and public support. But that did not stop the group from giving its top officials huge pay raises last year, including a 57 percent increase to chief executive Wayne LaPierre. The numbers, disclosed in the gun lobby giant’s latest tax filings, were reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday night. Between 2017 and 2018, compensation for the NRA’s top officials increased by 41 percent as the group’s spending on its core programs dropped significantly. Perks for top officials, the disclosures revealed, include charter and first-class jet travel for the leadership and their guests, as well as memberships at health and social clubs, plus housing expenses. LaPierre received overall compensation in 2018 of nearly $2.2 million, even as the NRA reported a $55 million decline in income, and its 2018 campaign spending was less than half of its totals for 2014 and 2016 congressional races. It was reportedly so cash-strapped that it even slashed spending on free coffee for its employees. Meanwhile, its revenue from membership dues have been dropping for years, declining by $35 million in 2017 alone. Dozens of its corporate partners have fled in response to online pressure, and it was forced to shut down its failed NRATV streaming service earlier this year. Despite its major financial struggles, the NRA reportedly considered buying LaPierre a $6 million mansion in a gated Dallas-area golf club to protect him from potential attacks after a 2018 mass shooting left 17 people dead at a high school in Parkland, Florida. That shooting — and the NRA’s fierce opposition to any meaningful action to prevent similar future attacks — began a sea-change in public opinion. For the first time since 1999, polling has found more Americans view the NRA unfavorably than favorably. A Fox News poll in August, taken after two more horrific mass shootings, found just 42 percent support for the group, versus 49 percent disapproval. Even among gun-owning households, the group’s support dropped to 56 percent from 67 percent a year earlier. Still, the group continues to maintain a stranglehold over Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. After initially expressing support for universal background checks and red flag laws in the wake of mass shootings in Texas and Ohio over the summer, Trump quickly caved to LaPierre’s demand that he “stop the games” and get back to blocking gun legislation.

Business By John Crudele Submit November 28, 2019 | 10:32pm  Designed for backpackers, bush pilots, and everything in between, we don’t recommend leaving the beaten path without an AR-7 in tow. 🇺🇸⁣ ⁣ Tag someone who’d love to see an AR-7 under their tree this Christmas in the comments. 💬⁣ ⁣ Photo by @_benchristensen 📸⁣ ⁣ #henryusa #henryrifles #huntwithahenry #22lr #2A⁣ A post shared by  Henry Repeating Arms (@henry_rifles) on Nov 26, 2019 at 6:14pm PST  My last column, in which I expressed a moderate view on gun control, touched a raw nerve like no dentist ever did with the ammo-loving crowd. And I think I’m starting to change my views on this issue — but not in a way that the gun-lovers will like. As a reminder, in that column I took offense to a company selling a rifle with the sales pitch “Nothing Says ‘Merry Christmas’ Like An AR-7.” Irreverent! Totally unacceptable. I also said in that column it’s time to stop selling assault weapons that can kill a lot of people in a short period of time. I didn’t, as many readers alleged, say that the AR-7 was one of those weapons. Two different issues. But I guess people were looking for a fight. I also made clear that I understand the allure of guns and how they fit in to family traditions. That brought out some deep thinkers in the gun crowd, like this guy who wrote: “You forgot to include what size panties you wear in your AR-7 article so that both of your friends could get you a proper gift for Christmas.” Wow, what wit! A double zinger! But how did he know about my undergarments? Have you been looking in my window? Many of the emails came in the middle of the night, so it was probably the booze writing. So, after all the notes I got, I now believe I’m being too moderate on this issue. There were so many people who were too cavalier about gun ownership and maybe shouldn’t own them. (“Cavalier,” for the panty guy, means “showing a lack of proper concern,” since I’m sure he’ll have to look it up.) I didn’t mention this in my last column, but I’ve known President Trump for more than 30 years. And I know that he reads The Post and my column regularly. When Trump is reelected, he will no longer need the support of the NRA or gun owners because 2020 will be his last election. So maybe the president can then be convinced to change his views on guns in general and automatic rifles in particular. Trump is a reasonable man, and the country may be one mass shooting away from revisiting the Second Amendment. I’ll probably give him a call.

356,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/supreme-court-about-to-hear-the-biggest-gun-control-case-in-a-decade.html," Matt Post is too young to remember the last time the Supreme Court heard a case over gun control. But the 20-year-old college student is hoping the nine justices think of him and other members of the so-called mass-shooting generation when they consider the scope of the Second Amendment during arguments in a landmark dispute next week. ""The shooting in Sandy Hook happened when I was in sixth grade, and I think it's hard for people who didn't grow up with this to learn how it weighs on you,"" Post, an activist with March for Our Lives, said in a recent interview. ""Someone can just come in and slaughter your classmates,"" he said. ""The Constitution guarantees you a better childhood than that."" On Monday, the Supreme Court is set to hear its first major Second Amendment case since 2010. The dispute, over a since-repealed New York City handgun regulation, comes amid heightened criticism of the nation's uniquely permissive gun laws. A decision is expected by July, in the midst of the 2020 presidential election. Gun-control advocates worry that a ruling could spell doom for measures that have been considered lawful by appeals courts in the past nine years, like assault weapon bans and restrictions on gun use outside the home. For gun-rights supporters, the case is a welcome return to the Second Amendment for a court that they see as having abandoned such cases for too long. While the top court has repeatedly taken cases featuring other aspects of the Bill of Rights, some conservatives, including Justice Clarence Thomas, have lamented what they see as the justices treating the Second Amendment as a ""second-class right.""  With a divided Congress unlikely to reach a deal on gun legislation any time soon, the most important vote on the issue for the foreseeable future is likely to come from the justices. The case has already spurred fighting among lawmakers. After a group of Democratic senators led by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., filed a brief in connection with the case warning the court it could be ""restructured,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate told the justices that they would protect them. The composition of the court has shifted since the court last heard a case involving gun legislation. Justice Anthony Kennedy has since departed, and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have joined it, forming a reliable conservative majority. Kavanaugh in particular has expressed an expansive view of gun rights. The court established a loose framework for gun legislation in a pair of cases decided in 2008 and 2010. In the 2008 case, D.C. v. Heller, the court found that the Second Amendment protected gun ownership unconnected with service in a militia. In 2010, the court applied that ruling to the states, in McDonald v. Chicago. Hannah Shearer, who researches Second Amendment litigation at the Giffords Law Center, an anti-gun violence group, said that since 2010 lower courts have treated the provision similarly to the First Amendment. ""They consider whether the law burdens Second Amendment rights, and whether there is a compelling public safety reason that is supported by evidence,"" Shearer said. The worry among gun-control proponents, Shearer said, is that the court could do away with considerations of public safety, known as a balancing test. ""It would mean that judges couldn't consider the public safety need for any given gun law and would only be looking at whether the law is supported by early American history,"" she said. Kavanaugh is on record as an opponent of the balancing test, having laid out his views in a 2011 dissent issued while a federal appeals court judge in Washington. ""Heller and McDonald leave little doubt that courts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny,"" he wrote. Thomas, who has been vocal about gun rights, and Gorsuch, whose approach to the law focuses heavily on how the Constitution was understood in the 18th century, are also likely votes in favor of broadening the reach of the Second Amendment. So, too, with fellow conservatives Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, who were part of the Heller and McDonald majorities, though their records are less certain. A sliver of hope for those on the left is that the court could drop the case altogether, due to a recent move by New York. The suit was brought by a group of gun owners living in New York City and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, an NRA-affiliate group, which challenged a New York City regulation barring the transport of handguns outside the home, including to a second residence. But that rule, which was believed to be the only such regulation of its kind in the nation, no longer exists. After the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, New York rushed to do away with the rule, seeking to avoid a ruling that could weaken gun control laws around the country. Attorneys for New York argued that the city's move made the case ""moot,"" or no longer active, and urged the court to dismiss the matter. But the court has not done so, and the gun owners argue that their case is still live because the city could still penalize them for past violations. The Trump administration, which is supporting the gun owners before the court, has argued that the case is still worth hearing because the gun owners could theoretically seek financial damages, though they haven't done so yet. In any case, the justices have decided to move forward with oral arguments. They have warned the attorneys who will be arguing on Monday that they should be prepared to debate whether the case is still active. ""We hope and expect that the court will dismiss this case as moot,"" Shearer said. If it does so, the legal landscape for gun legislation will likely be unchanged, at least for now. The case is New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York, New York, No. 18-280. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

357,https://slate.com/technology/2019/11/max-headroom-blipvert-trump-information-overload.html?via=rss,"Each day, it seems, brings a bewildering flood of news stories: impeachment hearings, the mess in Syria, another mass shooting, corporate malfeasance, the details of each development quickly surpassed by some new outrage powered by algorithm. In a recent BuzzFeed News piece called “The 2010s Have Broken Our Sense of Time,” Katherine Miller writes, “Life had run on a certain rhythm of time and logic, and then at a hundred different entry points, that rhythm and that logic shifted a little, sped up, slowed down, or disappeared, until you could barely remember what time it was.” This unrelenting drumbeat leaves many people feeling as though their heads are going to explode. But that feeling—of cascading content literally occupying more space in your brain than is available—isn’t so new. The same sentiment was behind a largely forgotten TV character: Max Headroom. Max Headroom was an animatronic TV icon in the 1980s, a sort of computer-generated, wise-cracking talking head and pitchman. He was an early avatar of the knowing, cynical, and irony-laden sensibility that dominates the media landscape today. Eventually, Headroom’s creators conjured up a weird 1985 TV movie, Max Headroom: Twenty Minutes Into the Future, to backfill the origin story. It eventually became a TV show, broadcast in the U.S. from 1987–88, and it was a wacky one. In a dystopian future, the world is dominated by media conglomerates. Execs meet behind closed doors to discuss how best to manipulate the dupes and rubes who consume what advertisers are selling. A distracted, alienated, and largely powerless citizenry has been consigned to mindless consumption of whatever is on their screens. And those screens are sometimes literally killing them. In the TV pilot an enterprising journalist, Edison Carter, stumbles on a dark secret. Channel 23, where he works, has developed something called the blipvert, which compresses 30 seconds of commercial content into three seconds before anyone has the chance to change the channel. There’s one small problem: The blipverts can cause people to spontaneously combust from having too much information packed into their heads. Eventually, network honchos hire two hit men to kill Carter. While trying to evade them, he is knocked out of commission when his motorcycle careens through a movable garage arm, with the words “Maximum Headroom” on it. Hence, he becomes the half-revived, half-computerized gadfly, Max Headroom. The show was a stark and depressing portrayal of loneliness, captured in the blipvert victims’ relationships with their television screens. It imagined people completely alienated from one another, their only connection to the outside world mediated by television conglomerates. Even Carter, in the pilot episode, is an egotistical celebrity journalist content to help Network 23 convert eyeballs into ad dollars. Indeed, when he discovers the blipvert’s effects, he is more excited by his journalistic scoop than horrified by the monstrous crime. Worries over the potential of technology to isolate and enervate citizens long predate Max Headroom, to be sure. But the show anticipated in some striking ways our growing anxieties about both the political power of contemporary media platforms and their capacity to disorient and disarm us (in some ways, emphasizing themes that Mr. Robot has so expertly explored). Those longer-term developments have run headlong into a presidency whose agenda seems to be set as much by President Donald Trump’s early morning Twitter rants as anything else. His tweets ensure a constant careening from one plot line to the next as knowing observers have to come think of the day’s news feed. Trumpism, in this context, seems premised on the weaponization of information overload—call it the blipvert presidency. Since the beginning of Trump’s term in office, members of the resistance have been admonishing people not to “get distracted” and to stay focused on Trump’s core transgressions. In other words, we are exhorted to stay vigilant in fighting that unrelenting cascade of misinformation. But maybe those exhortations are based on an unreasonable set of expectations about the carrying capacity of our brains. Maybe sometimes we do need to tune out, to seek out at least some distraction and give ourselves room to check out of the sheer madness and ceaseless torrent of bad faith emanating from the White House. The term of art these days in basketball for navigating the rigors of a long NBA season is load management: the idea that star players need to schedule regular days off, even if they’re not injured, to save their energy for when it matters most, the postseason. Some version of that is perhaps called for here. There are limits to what most people can take in before they feel like their heads are going to explode. It’s not that people should check out completely. Staying informed, involved, and engaged is critical for holding the powerful accountable. But the response to every fresh outrage need not be to stare at it harder and longer. Over the years, cultural critics, including on Slate, have appreciated Max Headroom as a dystopian tale of the depredations of commercialism and the ways in which media conglomerates have concocted a reality suited to their own interests. In 2019, the profound threat we face is that the political system itself is under siege by a concerted effort to obliterate the wall between truth and fiction. The goal of this war on our institutions and our brains is to weaken both. In place of the blipvert as a sinister conduit for commercial projects, we face a firehose of disinformation meant to pave the way for the ugliest politics imaginable. Despite the real threats—to democracy, to our individual psyches, and everything in between—of information overload, we are not yet in the world of Max Headroom. Yes, the big tech monopolies represent a serious collective problem, but unlike the corporations of Max Headroom’s world, they’re clearly not on the same page about every major issue. For instance, Twitter recently announced that it will ban all political advertising in 2020, while Facebook will not consider doing so. This matters because while our screen-saturated world is an irreversible reality, there’s no single entity—not even Facebook—that can turn off the information spigot, nor prevent informed and motivated Americans from the critical work of democracy defense. Indeed, in some ways we’re living in a golden age of activism and concerted collective action. Perhaps vigilance doesn’t have to mean vacuuming up every detail about each new scandal. Overconsumption can be self-defeating. We don’t have to follow every twist and turn of every preposterous offense. In fact, doing so can disorient and demotivate us. Instead, we should commit ourselves to working with those organizations and networks that are tackling the enormous challenges of our day. So, next time you feel guilty because you need a night off from Rachel Maddow or your Twitter feed, maybe it’s OK, even restorative, to give yourself a break. Maybe watch an old episode of Max Headroom instead. Future Tense

So, when he and wife Andrea Chamblee were settling into their Maryland home, the sportswriter had just one request. The den, McNamara decided, would be his sanctum. Chamblee understood and honored his request, and when McNamara launched his passion project – the definitive book about basketball in our nation’s capital – the den became a de facto library, filled with copies of microfiche and carefully indexed interviews. Chamblee knocked on the door merely to deliver his dinner – “Like a 1950s housewife,” she notes – and would return half an hour later to retrieve the empty plate. This routine played out for the better part of 11 years until an afternoon in June 2018 when a man armed with a shotgun stepped into the Annapolis, Maryland, newsroom of the Capital Gazette and began shooting. Five Gazette employees, including McNamara, were murdered and two wounded, sending ripples of grief that accompany every mass shooting in a country where they happen with greatest frequency. Chamblee calls the aftermath of a shooting “a huge circle of hurt and stress and trauma,” and she says the weight felt heaviest as she approached the den’s door. For several weeks, she shuddered as she walked by and learned to keep a box of tissues outside it. Only when she clutched her husband’s urn and determined it belonged there did she summon the will to enter. Once she did, Chamblee found the strength to finish McNamara’s life work – and find a path toward her own. As Chamblee inhabited her husband’s workspace, she found copiously detailed chapter outlines. A list of sources expecting return phone calls. And reams of paper with passages carefully noted in McNamara’s preferred orange highlighter. All provided a road map for Chamblee to finish what McNamara started, as emotionally wrenching as it was. She made the phone calls and filled in the blanks, all the while learning even more about her life partner than she could have imagined. And now, a little more than a year later, she has a tangible product of their shared work. ""The Capital of Basketball: A History of D.C Area High School Hoops"" is a 250-page repository of knowledge on a place that, at its core, is a basketball town. “I’m holding it in my hand and part of me wants to just keep it,” she says. “The other part of me wants everybody to know about it. Because he worked so hard on this book. “The stories are so good and the people are so remarkable. The story just had to be told.” The book hits all the bold-faced names that define D.C. hoops at every level – from Red Auerbach to Dave Bing, Elgin Baylor to Len Bias, John Thompson to Morgan Wootten to Kevin Durant – but its passion is reserved for the hidden figures. The world beyond the District may not know that circus impresario Maurice Joyce persuaded James Naismith to cut the players per side from nine to five in 1892, the better to provide a conditioning challenge for physical education. Or how basketball played a crucial role integrating D.C. thanks to E.B. Henderson, a trailblazing player and coach who wasn’t allowed to coach white students at the turn of the century, yet whose activism ultimately proved instrumental in the founding of the NAACP. While McNamara was knowledgeable about other sports, the book distills the passion of a true hoops head, a man who would stalk his area drugstore for days at a time every October until the Street & Smith’s college basketball annual dropped. McNamara could turn a simple trip to his hair salon into a night of basketball, once telling Chamblee they were bound for Northwest High that evening because the stylist wanted him to see her son play. McNamara’s intellectual curiosity for hoops and his even-handed coverage earned him the trust of coaches from the game’s grassroots to its area royalty. On an off day during the 2010 NCAA tournament, McNamara and Maryland coach Gary Williams’ paths intersected on a morning walk. So for two hours, they talked hoops but not shop, a rare window into the irascible coach who was equally pleased to clear his mind without expectations. Nearly a decade later, Williams would write the foreword for ""The Capital of Basketball."" In talking with Williams and Wootten and McNamara’s former colleagues, Chamblee realized what her husband meant to his profession. It has been heartening, she says, but also “kind of bittersweet.” McNamara’s final days with the Capital Gazette were spent not as a hoops scribe but a jack of all trades; a staff downsizing forced him to work news, sports and even page layout, since, at 56, he possessed all the requisite skills. “All these people tell me how much they liked his writing, how personable he was, and how he could make them see things in the sport – not just basketball – that they couldn’t see,” Chamblee says. “So I was like, why didn’t you tell your bosses at The Washington Post? “He would have liked to have some outside recognition. And now he’s getting it. People are showing up to say how much he helped them get a leg up.” The news media had been under siege from economic and political factors largely in a figurative sense until June 28, 2018, when Jarrod Ramos blasted through the doors of the Capital Gazette with a shotgun. Ramos sought vengeance against the paper when he lost a defamation suit filed after it reported on his harassment of a former high school classmate; a jury will determine if Ramos, who confessed to the crimes last month, will be legally culpable for the murders based on his mental illness. Ramos was armed with a legally purchased 12-gauge shotgun, which he procured 18 months before the attack despite a series of threats against the Gazette via letters and social media. “People ask me if I’m mad at the shooter,” Chamblee says. “From time to time I am, but the people I’m really mad at are the people who ask for the job to protect us – the politicians who say they want the job to make the laws that will keep society civil and protected. “And they turn away for a pittance of money. The amount of money it took for my husband’s memorial service – one guy, you can buy their soul for that amount of money. They can change it. They can make these preventable killings stop, with background checks for every gun sale, with requirements to lock up your guns so your kids don’t get it, so your toddler doesn’t shoot his little sister, so nobody takes it to school. These are really easy, that don’t affect anybody’s gun rights.” Chamblee’s frustration became palpable in February, after she addressed Maryland’s Judicial Proceedings Committee in support of Senate Bill 737, which would have regulated the sale of rifles and so-called “long guns” and created a licensing mechanism for them, similar to handgun sales. But the House and Senate chambers could not agree on a final version of the bill after a conference committee was appointed on the final day of the session. Gun control advocates largely place the blame on committee chair Bobby Zirkin, D-Baltimore County, who let the legislation sit in his committee for weeks. Chamblee has joined that chorus vociferously, accusing Zirkin of “running out the clock” in a Gazette editorial while casting aspersions on the totality of the system. “You’re so determined to protect your crappy little job that you let your constituents die in a pool of their own blood. What is wrong with them?"" she says. ""I get mad at them. I want to throw them out of office. I want to pick them up by the seat of their pants and throw them out, physically. And replace them with somebody who can’t be bought.” Chamblee, herself a former sportswriter and now an adjunct professor at George Washington’s School of Medicine and Public Health, says finishing McNamara’s book has provided distraction, but she expects “I’ll find myself unmoored again” once it begins gathering dust. She has learned that grief can envelop her anywhere. Once, she was waiting out a delayed connecting flight in Chicago when a phone conversation next to her was too loud to ignore. A man was cavalierly discussing the demise of his third marriage but expressed hope that the fourth time around would be the charm. Chamblee burst into tears. “Here’s this guy going through wives like one a decade,” she recalls, “and he asked me why I was crying. And I said, ‘Because my husband just died in a mass shooting, and I don’t know when I’m going to get used to it.’ “And he said, ‘You’ll have to get used to never getting used to it.’ ” The man was a Vietnam veteran who lost several friends in the conflict. “And I thought, ‘That’s a war zone, though,’” she says. “But so is this. It’s a war zone.” Since 1966, 1,220 people have been murdered in mass shootings, according to research by The Washington Post and Mother Jones. That includes 447 killed in the seven years since the murders of 26 students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in December 2012. Mass shootings – loosely defined as the murder of at least four people – occur with enough rapidity that one tends to erase the next. The elementary school, the newsroom, the church, the country music festival – all are subject to the vagaries of the news cycle and the public’s ease in looking away. Yet the shootings’ totality creates a community of survivors who don’t have that privilege. “I’ve learned there’s this huge, unspoken river of people who this happened to, and I’ve been pulled into the tide with them, and we’re all trying to keep our own heads above water,” Chamblee says. “And there’s hundreds and hundreds of us."" So Chamblee expects to put herself out there even more, wherever she feels inspired to fight on her husband’s behalf. She politely accepts kind words that frame her as courageous but stresses that she and other survivors are merely reacting. Living as her husband did – that’s the more noble endeavor. “It takes more courage and strength to be kind and gentle than it does to appear courageous and strong,” she says. “He was willing to give the shirt off his back for anybody. He put himself out there. He was just kind all the time. “Whenever I can’t find something, John would be the observant sportswriter and tell me where it was. And now, every time I can’t find something, I get so upset because he’s not there to say something nice and make me feel less scatterbrained. “And that’s when I really miss him.”",2019-11-29 09:27:35,'Story just had to be told': Slain Capital Gazette journalist's widow finishes his book,,25128,http://www.azcentral.com

Living By Associated Press Submit November 29, 2019 | 3:22pm AP AP AP AP View Slideshow OKLAHOMA CITY — Security is not subtle at the sprawling campus of human resources technology giant Paycom in Oklahoma City. Off-duty police officers roam the grounds, bolstering the company’s own force of armed guards. A basement command center that looks like something out of a spy movie is filled with video screens showing feeds from hundreds of security cameras at company offices across the country. While heavy security has become common at airports and stadiums to deter terrorism, extreme measures have been out of the ordinary at most companies eager to maintain a comfortable work environment and a welcoming atmosphere. But that may be changing, as more are now hardening their defenses with new techniques, and even new legal authority, to deal with growing fears about violence on the job. As mass shootings have become frequent, more company leaders have confronted an absence of clear plans for protecting workers from a disgruntled colleague, even after a threat is received. Now, spurred by an incident at Paycom, the company has produced a formal threat assessment and response guide that serves as a national model for ways to keep a potentially dangerous person away from other workers. The company’s approach also includes a new measure based on domestic violence laws. “This is a huge leap forward in public policy for safety in this country,” said Larry Barton, a University of Central Florida professor who teaches courses in threat evaluation at the FBI Academy. “This is a case study, for me as an educator, that I believe will be taught in business schools and in criminal justice courses for decades to come.” The guide was the product of brainstorming sessions convened by the company with workplace violence experts, law enforcement and civic leaders, after an ex-worker made threats against employees. A new law, enacted by the Oklahoma Legislature this year with Paycom’s guidance, allows businesses to petition the court for a victim’s protective order much like one that a woman might obtain against a former boyfriend. A judge can order a potentially dangerous person to stay away from a business or its employees, which companies couldn’t do before. Barton, a safety consultant for private companies, said dozens of businesses as well as policy makers have expressed interest in both the guide and the new law as a way to protect themselves. Although the number of people killed in workplace violence has remained steady at between 400 and 500 per year, Barton said there has been an increase in the number of on-the-job shootings involving four or more victims. “This has been an especially disturbing year,” Barton said. “We’re tracking now about a 19 percent increase in mass shootings, which is very noteworthy.” Among the recent high-profile incidents are a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May, in which a city engineer killed 12 people at his office, and the fatal shooting of five employees at an Aurora, Illinois manufacturing plant in February by a co-worker. Oklahoma has its own history of workplace violence. In 1986, a disgruntled worker shot 14 people at a post office in Edmond. Five years ago, a woman was beheaded at a food processing plant in Moore by a co-worker who had just been suspended. In the case of Paycom, which employs about 3,200 people nationwide, the former worker was arrested last year and is facing felony charges in connection with threatening messages and social media posts. The case has been moved to mental health court, which is designed to divert individuals with a mental illness from jail or prison. The new threat assessment guide lays out a series of factors that company officials should consider in judging a threat and how to respond. Included are questions about whether an employee has been undergoing personality changes, has a troubled personal life, exhibits confused thinking, is abusing drugs or alcohol or has access to firearms. Depending on how many questions are answered “yes,” responses can range from a one-on-one meeting, to termination to obtaining a protective order or calling 911.

Text to Speech Liberal Democrats are apparently not in the holiday spirit, a fact that was demonstrated on America’s Newsroom on Fox News on Tuesday, where host Bill Hemmer did his best to corral a guest who insisted Tucker Carlson should be fired. That guest was Michael Blake, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and an African-American liberal who was brought on to analyze the Democratic field and in particular Carlson's claim that the only candidate that can unify the Democrats is Michelle Obama. Fox News began the segment with a clip of Carlson saying the Democratic Party is “ripping itself apart over race and gender and class,"" and the former First Lady is “one of the only people who could unite the party’s warring factions.” Hemmer began jovially, noting Blake is a DNC vice chair and a New York state legislator (from the Bronx). ""Nice to see you, sir,"" he said. ""What do you think of the prediction on Michelle Obama. Blake opened with his rant:   BLAKE: She is not running. The core question is why the hell does Tucker Carlson still have a job here in the first place? The reality is this is someone who said white supremacy is a hoax. Why does Fox still allow him to be here in the first place? HEMMER: Do you think Michelle Obama will get in the race? BLAKE: Not going to happen. He shouldn't be on here at all. HEMMER: We get it. We didn’t bring you on to talk about Tucker Carlson, we brought you on to talk about the Democratic field. Are you happy with what you see in these candidates? BLAKE: Absolutely. Each are defeating Donald Trump. Absolutely,” the guest responded, “because I see each of them are defeating Donald Trump, and the reality is we’re in a space where people can continue to ignore his failed promises.That’s where we’re missing the boat. The reason why we are very confident that next November a Democrat is going to win is that we’re talking about jobs, we’re talking about health care, we’re talking about education. By contrast, Blake claimed, Trump is trying to ""avoid the truth."" But if we're talking about jobs, who's avoiding the truth on record-low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics? But Blake kept at it: ""We're talking about jobs while Donald Trump is ignoring the truth. We're talking about healthcare while Donald Trump is ignoring the turth. And the question must be for Donald Trump, for Fox News, for other entities..."" Hemmer stepped in. ""I didn't bring you on to bash our network. With all due respect why don't we keep it on topic?"" Blake replied ""It's relevant."" Hemmer insisted ""it's not...save it for later.""  Blake was referring to comments Carlson made after the August 3 shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, where a white extremist gunned down 22 people while targeting Hispanic immigrants. Carlson played clips of liberals blaming the mass shooting on Trump for anti-immigrant rhetoric and allegedly embracing white supremacists.  CARLSON: If you were to assemble a list, a hierarchy of concerns of problems this country faces, where would white supremacy be on the list? Right up there with Russia, probably. It's actually not a real problem in America. The combined membership of every white supremacist organization in this country would be able to fit inside a college football stadium. I mean, seriously, this is a country where the average person is getting poorer, where the suicide rate is spiking -- ""white supremacy, that's the problem"" -- this is a hoax. Just like the Russia hoax, it's a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power. That's exactly what's going on.

US President Donald Trump on Friday mocked former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke after he confirmed that he would drop out of the race to become the Democratic presidential candidate in 2020, with Trump saying O'Rourke ""quit like a dog."" O'Rourke told the New York Times Friday that he would no longer seek to win the Democratic nomination. O'Rourke had consistently failed to achieve poll numbers like those seen by frontrunners such as Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden. ""My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,"" O'Rourke told The Times. Trump mocked O'Rourke both on Twitter and at a rally in Tupelo, Mississippi Friday. The president and O'Rourke had clashed numerous times in recent years, with O'Rourke particularly critical of Trump's response to the deadly mass shooting in El Paso, Texas — O'Rourke's home town — in August, which left 22 people dead. Speaking in Tupelo, birthplace of Elvis Presley, Trump called O'Rourke a ""poor b******"" and a ""pathetic guy,"" according to a report from The Independent. ""He came out of Texas a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be,"" Trump continued.

In a Friday post on Medium, O'Rourke confirmed he was dropping out and thanked his supporters. He cited financial strain as a reason for bowing out of the crowded (but narrowing) 2020 field. ""Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,"" he wrote. ""My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country."" He declined to endorse a specific Democratic 2020 candidate, but instead said he would support whoever wins the nomination. ""We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020,"" he wrote. ""I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I'm going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is. And proud to call them president in January 2021, because they will win.""",2019-11-01 21:45:18,Beto O'Rourke is dropping out of 2020 Democratic presidential primary - Business Insider,,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com

Liz Alston, historian of Emanuel AME Church, sits in the church secretary's office in 2015 amazed at a $10,000 check that was donated to the church after the June 17 shooting left nine church members dead. SLED agents interviewed her this week. Grace Beahm/Staff State authorities have opened an investigation into the finances of Emanuel AME Church, which received millions of dollars in donations after a racist gunman killed nine worshippers at its Bible study in 2015. State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Tommy Crosby confirmed the investigation Thursday but declined to elaborate. Two women interviewed by SLED agents and an attorney for several victims’ families said that the probe involves the church’s finances. The church’s former secretary, Althea Latham, said she spoke to SLED agents last week about the handling of those donations. Latham's employment was ended less than two months after the shooting because she questioned processing and transparency surrounding the money that was coming in. Given the magnitude of money involved, she suggested tapping an outside financial expert. Church leaders have said her contract simply wasn't renewed. File/Paul Zoeller/Staff Althea Latham (center) was secretary for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney at Emanuel AME Church. Latham hopes that accountability will, four years later now, resolve suspicions that have festered over the donations since they were made and help the survivors, grieving families and church members better heal from the trauma. Attorney Andy Savage represents three shooting survivors and several of the victims’ families. His office confirmed that they were contacted by SLED and are cooperating with the investigation. The church's current pastor, the Rev. Eric S.C. Manning, who was assigned to Emanuel a year after the tragedy, said SLED hasn't reached out to him. “I have no earthly idea what’s going on,"" Manning said. ""That’s news to me.” The Rev. Norvel Goff, who served as interim pastor for the first seven months after the shooting, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The Rev. Norvel Goff, presiding elder of the AME Church district that includes Emanuel, served as interim pastor of the church after the 2015 mass shooting that left most of its ministerial staff dead. Goff took over after the church's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, and most of its ministerial staff were killed in the June 17, 2015, shooting, which was carried out by a self-avowed white supremacist, Dylann Roof. Roof is currently on federal death row for his crimes. As people around the world mourned the deaths of nine people killed during their Bible study, Emanuel's mail drop filled with condolence letters containing checks and cash. Mail arrived by the bagful. In 2015, Latham said she witnessed people in the church open envelopes addressed to victims’ families and survivors of the massacre. Those survivors and families have previously told The Post and Courier that they received mail sent to the church but addressed to them that had already been opened, some of it marked “empty.” Arthur Hurd, whose wife Cynthia died in the shooting, said he witnessed women in the church's fellowship hall open envelopes addressed to victims’ families and remove cash and checks from them without keeping a log of money received. Arthur Hurd filed a lawsuit over handling of the millions of dollars in donations that flowed into Emanuel AME Church after a mass shooting there in 2015 left nine worshipers dead. His wife Cynthia was among them. Hurd later filed a lawsuit, but it looked only at the fund Emanuel created to house the donations. It did not look at the church’s broader finances. Attorney Mullins McLeod Jr., who filed the suit, said Thursday that he had heard from a SLED agent but not spoken to anyone yet. Emanuel leaders have said the church received about $3.3 million in donations. They kept $1.8 million of that for the church and divided $1.5 million among the families of the nine victims, as well as survivor Polly Sheppard, who did not lose a family member in the massacre. Goff, who remains presiding elder over the district that includes Emanuel, has in the past denied any improprieties occurred with the handling of the donations. Longtime Emanuel member Liz Alston confirmed that she spoke with SLED agents on Tuesday. A former church trustee and Emanuel's historian, she said members haven’t received proper financial accounting from church leaders since the shooting, despite the flocks of visitors who still pour in and leave money in the collection plate every Sunday. “I do hope some accountability will come out of this investigation,” Alston said. “Financial accountability is a big problem at Emanuel. Yes, SLED is investigating — at my blessing.” Many of the shooting victims' family members were angered when the church kept more of the donations than it divided up among the families. Among those still hurt by the church's distribution method is Felicia Sanders, who survived by hiding beneath a table and playing dead with her 11-year-old granddaughter. Her son, Tywanza, was killed right beside them. When Emanuel distributed the donations, Sanders received the same amount as other families of the nine who died but no money for herself or the young girl, now a teenager. The child has needed substantial mental health care, including hospitalization, for the trauma she survived. She will likely continue to need treatment in the years ahead, a family spokesman said.

372,https://www.thedailybeast.com/beto-orourke-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race-will-not-run-for-senate,"SEARCH “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.” Politics Reporter Washington Bureau Chief Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) is ending his presidential campaign after struggling for months to gain momentum, as the crowded Democratic primary thins out less than 100 days before the Iowa caucus. “Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” O’Rourke wrote in a Medium post announcing his move on Friday. “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.” Rumors about O’Rourke’s candidacy began shortly after his Senate campaign concluded. But for months, he put off making a decision, leaving top Democratic operatives who may have signed on with him to look elsewhere. The entrance into the race of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, perceived to occupy the same lane for a young, fresh-faced outsider, appeared to further dull the allure of O’Rourke’s bid. When he finally launched he did so with much fanfare. A Vanity Fair article timed to his announcement marketed his bid as a second chance at political greatness for the former Texas congressman after failing to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. O’Rourke was featured on the magazine cover standing on a dirt road, outside a pick-up truck with the words, “Beto’s Choice” written in bold over his left shoulder and the quote, “I want to be in it. Man, I was born to be in it.” And he was, for a few weeks, anyway. In the first 18 days of his candidacy, O’Rourke raised an impressive $9.4 million. But his star began to fall as quickly as it rose. A lack of fully formed policy positions and a series of lackluster debate appearances contributed to his failure to harness the same energy that that was seen during his Senate campaign. A mass shooting at a Walmart in his hometown of El Paso took him off the campaign trail briefly in August as he mourned with his community. When he returned to the race, O’Rourke, 47, called for a mandatory buyback program of assault-style weapons, which ignited loud applause during a Democratic primary debate in his native Texas in September. Days later, his unofficial campaign slogan became “hell yes”—a line from his debate performance that if he were elected president, he would buy back such weapons. While the move helped rally some progressives in key voting states, his promise proved to be politically risky and was met with some skepticism among his fellow Democrats and guns rights activists, who argued he was giving fuel to Republicans by calling for such drastic measures. By the end of his campaign, O’Rourke was at approximately 2 percent nationally. And while he made his plans to withdraw from the presidential race public on Friday, he has consistently ruled out running for any other office in 2020, including challenging Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX). “Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was “born for this.” I don’t think so!,” President Donald Trump tweeted on Friday afternoon. Just hours before he suspended his bid, his campaign released official plans to file for the New Hampshire primary and return to the state on Nov. 8. “Beto will be joined by local supporters at the New Hampshire State House for the filing event,” the release reads. Ultimately, O’Rourke pledged to help elect the party’s nominee to take on Trump in the general election. “We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020,” he wrote. “I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I’m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is.” Politics Reporter Washington Bureau Chief Got a tip?

SEE YOU IN COURT — POLITICO’s Madina Touré: Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city will sue President Donald Trump if he moves forward with plans to cut food assistance — a move that will affect more than 20,000 New York City children. The Trump administration's proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — a federal program that provides low-income people and families with a monthly food supplement — will affect more than 1 million children across the United States, including as many as 21,000 children in New York City, de Blasio told reporters on Wednesday morning during an event at P.S. 20 in Manhattan. BREAKING DOWN SILOS — POLITICO's Amanda Eisenberg: City Council Member Ritchie Torres plans to introduce legislation Wednesday requiring that the New York City health department create a list of free mental health and substance use services and share it with agencies that work with young adults, children and families. … The bill from the Bronx Democrat directs the city to compile the list, which would include services provided or covered by the city, state and federal governments, and nonprofit and community-based organizations, annually. The legislation will also require annual training for agencies to ensure clients are accessing care under the behavioral health umbrella. MATERNAL HEALTH FUNDING — POLITICO's Shannon Young: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has awarded the state Department of Health a $450,000 grant to partner with New York City health officials on sustaining the work of the NYS Maternal Mortality Review Board, Gov.

LET’S JUST DO IT AND BE LEGENDS, MAN — Late Tuesday, BuzzFeed broke an explosive story on a lawsuit filed by an ex-JUUL executive that alleges the company shipped one million contaminated e-cigarette pods last year despite internal warnings. When the executive, Siddharth Breja, recommended putting a ‘best-by’ date on the pods, “the lawsuit claims that then-CEO Kevin Burns shot down that idea, saying, ‘Half our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fos, who the f--- is going to notice the quality of our pods.’” POWDER PROBLEMS — With lawsuit liabilities growing, Johnson & Johnson has spent the last several weeks attacking a government test result that found asbestos in the company’s baby powder. Subsequent tests conducted by the company purportedly found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot. However, “in challenging the FDA’s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts. The private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J,” write Chad Terhune and Lisa Girion in a monster exclusive for Reuters. MAKENA — The FDA’s advisory committee voted 9-7 to withdraw Makena from the market on Tuesday. While recent findings found no safety issues with the drug, which is designed to prevent preterm births and has been widely prescribed since the 2011, they also discovered “ that the weekly synthetic progestin injections didn’t decrease recurrent preterm births in women who took it versus a placebo,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

The problems are much more systemic, according to Maria Abi-Habib and Salman Masood of The New York Times. “Government officials believe he is not the only cause there, and that the bad practices he is accused of, including reusing syringes and IV needles, are so widespread across Pakistan that the entire health care system needs better regulation.” DON’T DO THAT — A Tennessee psychiatrist may lose her license for allegedly whipping patients, The Associated Press reports. SEEKING SERVICES — The Washington Post reports: “The White House announced an upgrade Wednesday to a government website that helps people find treatment for substance use, a step officials hope will help address one of the most enduring problems of the opioid epidemic.” MISSED A ROUNDUP?

374,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/30/elizabeth-warren-ban-deadly-firearm-suppressors/,"Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren’s overarching gun control plan includes a ban on firearm suppressors. The plan is posted on her campaign page, where she pledges to “[prohibit] accessories that make weapons more deadly.” She does not grapple with the fact that a suppressor has been used in only one mass shooting during the 21st century, the May 31, 2019, Virginia Beach attack, And even then, the New York Times reported witnesses heard the attacker’s gunshots as he moved through the building. The left presents suppressors as devices that silence gunshots, yet in reality suppressors simply reduce the sharp, ear-splitting sound wave accompanies the sound of a bullet being fired. The sound of the gunshot is very much audible, even with a suppressor attached. Pertinent to the Virginia Beach shooting was the fact it occurred in a part of the building that was mandated gun-free for city employees. This means the gunman had every advantage, with or without a suppressor, inasmuch as his victims could not shoot back. The Crime Prevention Research Center examined mass public shootings for the time period of 1950 to May 2018 and found that 97.8 percent of them occurred in gun-free zones. Yet Warren’s to-do list for ending gun violence says nothing about abolishing gun-free zones so Americans can exercise their Second Amendment right to self-defense. Warren did, however, mention banning “trigger cranks” along with suppressors.

375,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/11/01/sutherland-springs-shooter-rejected-by-dicks-sporting-goods-bought-weapon-at-academy-wife-says/,"newsPolitics By Lauren McGaughy 4:36 PM on Nov 1, 2019 CDT AUSTIN — The man who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs two years ago tried to buy a gun from one sporting goods store before he was able, just months later, to purchase the AR-style rifle he used in the shooting from another retailer, according to his wife. In an affidavit provided to a group of local families who are suing Academy Sports + Outdoors, Danielle Kelley wrote that her husband, Devin Kelley, tried to purchase a rifle from a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in New Braunfels in late 2015. At the time, the couple lived in Colorado, where high-capacity magazines are banned, and her husband presented an ID from that state, so the manager turned him away, she said. A few months later, however, Kelley purchased a rifle at an Academy store in Selma, a San Antonio suburb, his wife explained. “It was a quick and easy transaction. It is my understanding that the firearm Devin used in the Sutherland Springs shootings was the AR 556 that Devin bought at Academy,” Danielle Kelley wrote. “After Devin purchased the AR, we consistently went back to Academy in Selma. With each visit to Academy, which happened about once a month, Devin would purchase additional magazines and multiple boxes of ammunition.” Kelley added she was unaware of her husband’s criminal history, which made his possession of any firearms illegal. Kelley’s affidavit marked a win for the Sutherland Springs families suing Academy. They claim the retailer’s employees broke federal law by selling an out-of-state resident a magazine banned in his state of residence, accuse the retailer of gross negligence and seek damages for physical and mental anguish, disfigurement and medical expenses. Academy, which is headquartered in Katy, has declined to comment on the lawsuit. The sporting goods chain says it’s not responsible for the shooting because Kelley passed a background check. It argues that federal law defines “firearm” and “magazine” as different and separate things, which means the sale appeared to be legal. Kelley, a veteran, had a history of domestic abuse and other violent behavior that the U.S. Air Force admitted it failed to report to a federal criminal database, allowing him to purchase his weapons without raising red flags. In a December report, the Air Force said it failed on six occasions to report information that would have prevented Kelley from legally purchasing a gun. In addition to the lawsuit against Academy, several Sutherland Springs families have sued the federal government, saying its negligence helped Kelley carry out the shooting. The Trump administration argues the government should not be liable for these mistakes and has also placed the blame on Academy. “The Federal Gun Control Act required Academy to comply with the laws of both Texas, the seller’s state, and Colorado, the buyer’s apparent state of residence,"" Paul David Stern, a Justice Department attorney, said in a filing in the suit against the federal government. “Academy was not permitted to sell Kelley the Model 8500 Ruger AR-556 under federal law because sale of that rifle would have been illegal in Colorado.” Danielle Kelley’s affidavit was provided to attorneys for the families suing Academy, her lawyer confirmed. The rural central Texas community of Sutherland Springs will soon mark two years since the shooting. More than two dozen people, including a pregnant woman, several children and a baby, were killed in the attack, the worst in modern Texas history. Lauren McGaughy.

File/Paul Zoeller  Former S.C. State Rep, Mike Pitts, a Laurens Republican who chaired the House Ethics Committee, was appointed to the magistrate's bench after he retired from the Legislature. File/Paul Zoeller/Staff Chairman Rep. Mike Pitts, R-Laurens. When South Carolina lawmakers confirmed a batch of new magistrates this year, one nominee stood out from the pack: Mike Pitts. The former state House member had made a name for himself in Columbia as a staunch defender of the Confederate flag, and on Facebook he has penned anti-immigration screeds and used racially charged language. In May, for example, he posted a photo of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, an African American Democrat running for president. His caption: “Cory Booker alway [sic] looks like he just hit crack real hard.” None of this, however, prompted any discussion in June, when the state Senate confirmed Pitts along with 33 other nominees for the lower courts. Unlike South Carolina’s felony and appellate court judges, magistrates are not subjected to legislative hearings before lawmakers sign off on their appointments. In fact, there’s rarely any public debate at all. Nominations typically sail through the upper chamber with a single voice vote. Although magistrates oversee mostly misdemeanor matters, their authority is substantial; each year, they decide hundreds of thousands of cases, including criminal ones that can send someone to prison for months or saddle them with thousands of dollars in fines. But the confirmation process allows new recruits to escape public scrutiny and sitting magistrates to remain on the bench even after they’ve been disciplined for misconduct, an investigation by The Post and Courier and ProPublica found. Some appointees have gone on to make racist and sexist comments from the bench. Magistrate Willie Bethune in Clarendon County, for example, said a defendant was attractive and asked her to show off her bellybutton. He was later accused of pressuring that woman into giving him sexual favors. While he denied the charges, he resigned amid an investigation by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, which polices judges and lawyers in the state. Charleston Magistrate James Gosnell, who is white, used a racial slur during a bond hearing for an African American defendant and was reprimanded by the disciplinary office; he described it as an ill-considered attempt to get the man to change his path in life. The judge remains on the bench today, reappointed in May. Beaufort County Magistrate Peter Lamb called crack cocaine “a black man’s disease” and later resigned. As part of an agreement with the state Supreme Court, he acknowledged misconduct in that instance — and in others — and promised to never seek judicial office again, without permission. The Post and Courier and ProPublica found Pitts’ Facebook page while researching the backgrounds of all 319 magistrates in South Carolina. Like many magistrates, he doesn’t have a law license; to qualify for nomination to the lower courts, applicants need only to earn an undergraduate degree and pass a basic competency exam. Pitts served as a police officer in South Carolina for a decade before retiring in 1987. Several of his posts appear at odds with key tenets of the state’s judicial code of conduct, which stresses impartiality and strict avoidance of words or actions that demonstrate bias or prejudice. In a November 2017 post, he complained about people “from the Middle East” in Walmart and wrote, “after being subject to this incident I now support shutting down all immigration until we stop the demise of our culture.” And he has been recently photographed wearing a shirt reading, “Welcome to America Learn the Damn Language!” In another post, Pitts criticized transgender people, saying “they aren’t sure what the hell they are.” Pitts, a Republican who recently took the bench, didn’t respond to messages left by phone and email. Civil rights advocates condemned Pitts’ remarks and called for his removal. “A person with such racist and xenophobic views should not be placed in a position that will inevitably impact the lives of citizens in a diverse community,” said Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “Magistrate Pitts should be removed from his post in order to maintain the objectivity and impartiality of the South Carolina judicial system.” Brenda Murphy, president of the South Carolina chapter of the NAACP, said her group is “totally against” the idea of Pitts donning the robe. “We would not want someone who has made those comments appointed as a magistrate in a local community,” she said. Some state lawmakers also questioned Pitts’ fitness for the bench. Rep. Gary Clary Republican state Rep. Gary Clary, a former state circuit judge, said the posts could be “grounds for recusal” in cases where people of color or transgender people appear before Pitts. “That’s the reason judges don’t normally have Facebook and Twitter accounts,” Clary said. “You are supposed to be fair and impartial.” State Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a Democrat, went further. “None of us were aware of these posts, or his ethnic and racially insensitive comments, which I think disqualify him as a fair or impartial judge,” Harpootlian, a longtime trial lawyer, said after The Post and Courier described Pitts’ posts. “If I was Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent, I would be fearful of appearing in front of him.” S.C. state Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a Columbia Democrat. File/John Carloss II A spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster said no one brought the posts to his attention before McMaster, a Republican, signed off on Pitts' appointment this year. The governor declined to expand on the issue. ​ Chief Justice Donald Beatty of the South Carolina Supreme Court, who oversees all of the state's court officials, also declined to comment. A Republican who served 13 years in the legislature, Pitts has long stoked controversy. When state leaders pressed to remove the Confederate flag from Statehouse grounds in 2015 after the mass shooting at Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church, Pitts was a chief opponent. The following year, he proposed legislation to require journalists to register with the state government or face fines. And in 2018, Pitts co-sponsored a bill requiring South Carolina lawmakers to consider seceding from the Union if the federal government “confiscates legally purchased firearms.” Neither measure passed. More recently, his bid to run the state’s land conservation agency fell apart amid concerns that Pitts, an ex-cop, wasn’t qualified for the job. Critics said the move was a political gift to Pitts following retirement from the House last year. He withdrew from consideration, saying the “aggressive inquisition” he faced during a confirmation hearing had harmed his health after a heart attack last year. “I tired quickly and realized that my cognitive skills have been affected,” he wrote in his withdrawal letter. But within months, Pitts was a candidate for a magistrate seat in Laurens County, a mostly rural area in the upper portion of the state, about an hour from the Blue Ridge Mountains. A quarter of the area’s residents are black. “I have applied for jobs in several different locations in private industry and other places,” he told the Greenwood Index-Journal. “I’m not ready to retire and I’m either too old, too experienced or too hot a potato.” This time, with the backing of his Republican colleague, state Sen. Danny Verdin, he faced far less scrutiny. “The bottom line is, this is a job I’m well qualified for,” Pitts told the Index-Journal, citing his law enforcement background. Sen. Danny Verdin backed Pitts for a magistrate's job. He is shown here speaking in favor of the Confederate battle flag as the Senate prepares to vote on its removal from the Statehouse grounds in 2015. File/Paul Zoeller Unlike any other state in the country, South Carolina allows state senators to hand-pick magistrate judges. Because they are considered local appointments, senators almost never question selections outside their delegation. The governor signs off on the appointments, but largely defers to the legislative chamber. The process for selecting magistrates varies from county to county. In the Charleston metro area, for example, the eight-member senate delegation convenes public meetings to review and discuss the qualifications of potential candidates. Greenville, with seven senators, operates much the same way. But in a dozen of the state’s 46 counties, including Laurens, the selection of magistrates lies in the hands of a single senator. That meant Pitts only required Verdin’s backing. The Post and Courier asked the lawmaker about Pitts’ Facebook posts, but Verdin declined to review them. “That’s not necessary,” he said. “I will have no comment.” Agnel Philip contributed to this report.

WHITE, CARLA MARINUCCI, ALEXANDER NIEVES and GRAPH MASSARA 11/19/2019 09:20 AM EST Presented by Local Solar for All THE BUZZ: California voters are warming up to impeachment. For months, as momentum to try and remove Donald Trump has built to the point that every freshman California Democrat in Congress has gotten on board, the national Republican Party has derided the drive as not just pointless but as political poison. They’ve brandished Public Policy Institute of California polling from May (back before the Ukraine chapter) showing an unequivocal majority of the California electorate opposed beginning proceedings. But new PPIC polling registers a broad shift in favor of the i-word. An eight-point majority of likely California voters now believe the president should be impeached and removed from office, including a slight majority of the all-important independent voter bloc. And those responses were recorded before public hearings launched last week with dramatic testimony from foreign policy officials. There are warning signs within those responses, though: Probable voters were slightly more likely to disapprove of how Democrats in Congress are handling the impeachment inquiry, and the support for impeaching Trump is not uniform across California. Slightly more voters in the Inland Empire and Orange County-San Diego areas are against impeachment and removal; in the Central Valley, home to a couple of contested House races, voters overwhelmingly oppose the idea. (One more data point: a new GOP-aligned ad blitz targeting Dems over impeachment is skipping California). PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS: Former Veep Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren took some flak for eschewing the California Democratic Party convention this weekend, but they remain in the good graces of California Democratic primary voters: they’re effectively tied as the top preference with about a quarter of the electorate each, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders at 17 percent. Sen. Kamala Harris is languishing at 8 percent, a notch above South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Voters continue to feel pragmatic, vastly preferring the candidate they think can beat Trump to the nominee with the best policy ideas. FIREWALK WITH HIM: Gov. Gavin Newsom is doing alright by the state he governs, drawing plurality approval ratings without cracking 50 percent. But wildfire-connected blackouts continue to present political peril, with a plurality of likely voters disapproving of how Newsom has handled the issue. Clear majorities of adults and voters are concerned about losing power. SPLIT ROLL STRUGGLES: The ballot initiative to lift Prop 13 property tax caps and direct the proceeds to schools continues to look politically precarious, with just 46 percent of likely voters saying they would back it against 45 percent who wouldn’t. Take a look at the full PPIC results here. BUENOS DIAS, good Tuesday morning. Another round of public impeachment hearings just began a few minutes ago in D.C., with Lt. Col Alexander Vindman and VP Mike Pence aide Jennifer Williams appearing this morning. — QUOTE OF THE DAY: “I think we're on our third strike for PG&E. Strike one was the San Bruno gas explosion that they tried to cover up and then they lied about it. Strike two was the 2017 and '18 wildfires. Strike three is the woefully inadequate response to these power shutoffs. We cannot nip around the edges; it's now time for this state to be able to have all options on the table. They failed us too many times.” State Sen. Mike McGuire during a legislative hearing that trained legislative anger on the embattled utility and its CEO. — TWEET OF THE DAY: Bloomberg tech-labor reporter @JoshEidelson: “hey I just met you and this is crazy but if you're going to claim the story is factually inaccurate then how about offering an example of a fact in it that is not accurate” — WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced. — “Possible pay-to-play scheme for ambassador role in Trump administration uncovered by CBS News,” via CBS: “Emails obtained by CBS News show the nominee, San Diego billionaire Doug Manchester, was asked by the RNC to donate half a million dollars as his confirmation in the Senate hung in the balance, chief investigative correspondent Jim Axelrod reports.” — “Orinda Halloween shooting: District Attorney declines to file charges,” by the Merc’s Nate Gartrell. — “2 victims identified in mass shooting in Fresno as famous singers by Hmong news,” by the Fresno Bee’s Brianna Calix. BAD APPLES? “Noose, threat of lynching, racist graffiti during construction of Apple’s Spaceship campus: feds,” by the Merc’s Ethan Baron: “All of this happened at Apple’s ‘Spaceship’ campus in Cupertino while the $1.1 billion project was under construction, and a San Jose electrical subcontractor for Apple tolerated it, a just-filed civil-rights lawsuit by federal employment regulators alleges.” — “Congress strikes stopgap funding deal, postpones border wall fight,” by POLITICO’s John Bresnahan and Caitlin Emma: “The continuing resolution unveiled by House Democrats would last until Dec. 20, leaving out any restrictions on border barrier spending, which President Donald Trump demanded in exchange for his signature.” — ""ICE quest for detention space in California draws fire from top Dems in state,"" by the SF Chronicle's Tatiana Sanchez: ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wants to lock in new contracts for four privately operated detention centers before the state bans such agreements with companies on Jan. 1."" BAD FOR KAMALA: “‘Joe is an uncle to our state’: South Carolina polls show Biden with blowout lead,” by POLITICO’s Marc Caputo: “The newest polls are a gut-punch to the two African-American senators who have looked to the state as a springboard, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.” — “Free public college tuition will expand opportunity to more Americans,” by South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the Sacramento Bee: “Cost should never be a barrier to a brighter future – and we can’t build a 21st century economy without including all Americans. So I’m releasing an ambitious plan to make educational opportunity available whether you go to college or not.” BERNIEFORNIA: Sen. Bernie Sanders picked up another California endorsement Monday from Assemblyman Ash Kalra. The San Jose Democrat emphasized Sanders’ economic agenda, which he said would “reverse the 40-year decline of the middle class.” — “California and Nevada Ask: Iowa Who?” by NYT’s Jennifer Medina: “In a series of forums in California and Nevada this weekend, candidates offered a glimpse of how they were pitching themselves to an electorate that is less white, more likely to be represented by a labor union, and often more liberal than crowds in New Hampshire and Iowa.” TEAM SMITH: Assemblywoman Christy Smith continues to pile up the establishment endorsements for her CA-25 bid, with the Democrat adding Reps. Ami Bera and Alan Lowenthal to her growing California delegation list of supporters. Rival Democrat Cenk Uygur has the backing of Rep. Ro Khanna. HEALTH CARE: “Does Gavin Newsom have the answer to Democrats' health-care fights?” by POLITICO’s Angela Hart: “Newsom’s is by far the most relevant — and revelatory — experiential test of the Democratic health care ideas that will be so hotly debated on the Atlanta debate stage Wednesday night. And it offers something for everyone in the race to chew on: “A testament to the power that a promise of a single-payer system can have in galvanizing the party’s base; the unforgiving realities that make a quick conversion to single-payer practically, and probably politically, impossible; and a way for a leader to win broader support for incremental steps that — if pursued diligently enough — could lead to universal coverage.” PRESSURE ON PG&E: ""PG&E aims to reduce shutoffs by one-third in 2020,"" by POLITICO Pro’s Colby Bermel: “In an all-day hearing, legislators grilled PG&E CEO Bill Johnson for his company's forced blackouts last month and heard from other utilities, state officials and community representatives in a standing-room-only auditorium.” — “800,000 people could be blacked out Wednesday, Thursday,” by the SF Chronicle’s J.D. Morris and Carolyn Said: “Power shutoffs could begin a few hours earlier and last hours later than the weather issues but appear likely to be shorter-term than October’s multi-day outages.” JUUL DRAMA: “California sues Juul, alleges company targeted youth,” by POLITICO’s Victoria Colliver: “In the 78-page complaint filed in Alameda Superior Court, the state also alleges that Juul failed to verify consumers' ages and violated the privacy of minors by using their personal email addresses for marketing.” — “Emergency measures: Bay Area cities scramble to stop recent spike of displaced renters,” by The Mercury News’ Marisa Kendall: “Assembly Bill 1482, passed in September, will cap annual rent increases at about 9% and prevent landlords from removing tenants without an approved reason, such as failure to pay rent. But the law doesn’t go into effect until Jan. 1. In the meantime, activists around the state report some landlords are using this window to kick existing tenants out now, presumably with the hope of moving in new, higher-paying renters.” — “Stunned with grief after Saugus shooting: ‘The scares and trauma we see on TV came to Santa Clarita,’” by the LA Times’ Marisa Gerber: “Here in Santa Clarita, in this park that is forever changed, people crumple to their knees before the flag flapping at half-staff. Parents pray and sob, teenagers stare at the balloons, blue and silver for their school colors.” — “Top Senate Democrats release principles for federal privacy legislation,” by POLITICO Pro’s Cristiano Lima. BECERRA SPEAKS: “Decoding California AG Xavier Becerra's battles with Silicon Valley,” by POLITICO’s Cristiano Lima, Nancy Scola and Alexandra Levine: “In a meeting with reporters and editors in the POLITICO newsroom this week, Becerra ... discussed how he’s approaching investigating tech, his thoughts on existing antitrust laws and what he’s telling his old colleagues in Congress.” — “Inside Facebook's efforts to stop revenge porn before it spreads,” by NBC’s Olivia Solon: “The team’s goal is not only to quickly remove pictures or videos once they have been reported, as happened in Zehara’s case, but also to detect the images using artificial intelligence at the moment they are uploaded, to prevent them from being shared at all.” — “Top Senate Democrats release principles for federal privacy legislation,” by POLITICO Pro’s Cristiano Lima. LABOR STRUGGLE: “How Workers Are Fighting Back Against Big Tech,” by Vice’s Rick Paulas: “As these truths become more blatant, a diverse group of workers—programmers and coders, drivers and cafeteria staff—are beginning to bond as a sort of cohesive class.

Blaze Bernstein, age 19 at the time of his murder, loved to cook. Before he traveled back to his home in California for the 2017-’18 winter break, the University of Pennsylvania sophomore had been elected managing editor of a campus cooking publication called Penn Appétit. It’s a position he ended up never filling. On the morning of January 2, his parents noticed that he’d left their house in the Orange County community of Foothill Ranch and tried to contact him. When he didn’t respond, they checked his Snapchat account and found messages between their son and Sam Woodward, a former high school classmate. The two had planned to hang out at a local park. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, texted friends that he and Woodward were meeting for a sexual encounter. Less than a week later, investigators discovered Bernstein’s body in the park, hidden by a tree branch and a mound of dirt. He had been stabbed 19 times in the neck. Authorities quickly identified Woodward as a suspect and found Bernstein’s blood in his car and on a knife in his possession. They learned that Woodward was a member of Atomwaffen Division — one of the most extreme neo-Nazi groups in the country. He was arrested; he pleaded not guilty and is still awaiting trial. The local Jewish community center celebrated Bernstein’s memory by naming its cooking school in his honor. Atomwaffen celebrated Woodward by making T-shirts emblazoned with his mugshot. Bernstein’s 2018 slaying marked the beginning of an extraordinary period of white supremacist violence — a spate of murders and mass shootings that has continued through this year. The October 2018 shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue was the deadliest act of anti-Semitic violence in American history. The March 2019 Islamophobic attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s history. It was followed in April by another attack on an American synagogue (this time in Poway, California), and an August 2019 shooting at an El Paso Walmart that was one of the most brutal attacks targeting Hispanics in US history. In late July, FBI Director Christopher Wray reported that the FBI had made as many domestic terrorism arrests in 2019 as it did in all of 2018 — and further, that “a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we’ve investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.” These killings were often linked to the alt-right, described as an outgrowth of the movement’s rise in the Trump era. But many of these suspected killers, from Atomwaffen thugs to the New Zealand mosque shooter to the Poway synagogue attacker, are more tightly connected to a newer and more radical white supremacist ideology, one that dismisses the alt-right as cowards unwilling to take matters into their own hands. It’s called “accelerationism,” and it rests on the idea that Western governments are irreparably corrupt. As a result, the best thing white supremacists can do is accelerate their demise by sowing chaos and creating political tension. Accelerationist ideas have been cited in mass shooters’ manifestos — explicitly, in the case of the New Zealand killer — and are frequently referenced in white supremacist web forums and chat rooms. Accelerationists reject any effort to seize political power through the ballot box, dismissing the alt-right’s attempts to engage in mass politics as pointless. If one votes, one should vote for the most extreme candidate, left or right, to intensify points of political and social conflict within Western societies. Their preferred tactic for heightening these contradictions, however, is not voting, but violence — attacking racial minorities and Jews as a way of bringing us closer to a race war, and using firearms to spark divisive fights over gun control. The ultimate goal is to collapse the government itself; they hope for a white-dominated future after that. Accelerationism has bizarre roots in academia. But as strange as the racist movement’s intellectual history may be, experts believe it has played a significant and under-appreciated role in the current wave of extremist violence. “It’s not an ideology that exists in a theoretical sense,” says Joanna Mendelson, a senior investigative researcher at the Anti-Defamation League. “It’s an ideology that has actually manifested in real-world violence.” The earliest version of “accelerationism” was, ironically enough, in some ways a celebration of the status quo. The mainstream ethos of the 1990s was thoroughly capitalist, the collapse of the Soviet Union creating a sense that the spread of the American economic and political model was inevitable and irresistible. This coincided with a technological revolution — the rise of widespread internet access and the birth of mass internet culture, a sense of a world defined by and connected through technology in previously incomprehensible ways. At the University of Warwick, a relatively new but well-regarded English university, a young philosophy professor named Nick Land argued that the triumph of capitalism and the rise of technoculture were inextricably intertwined. Drawing on the work of famously dense continental theorists like Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Jean-Francois Lyotard, Land argued that capitalist technological advancement was transforming not just our societies, but our very selves. The self, he believed, was being dissolved by the increasing speed and pace of modern life — the individual was becoming less important than the techno-capitalist system it found itself in. “Modernity has Capitalism (the self-escalating techno-commercial complex) as its motor,” Land wrote in an email to Vox, in characteristically cryptic style. “Our question was what ‘the process’ wants (i.e. spontaneously promotes) and what resistances it provokes.” The “we” he’s referring to is the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a group of Warwick faculty members and graduate students who worked with Land to examine the questions that would come to define this early accelerationism. The writing that came out of CCRU’s work has a hallucinatory, ethereal quality that makes it hard to figure out exactly what they’re trying to say (Land’s marquee book is titled Fanged Noumena). It also feels very of its time; CCRU members obsessed over electronica and used the word “cyber” a lot, all conveying a sense of a society rapidly accelerating toward an exciting future. The CCRU was a fount of mad energy, obsessed with the pace of life under late capitalism; its members had utter disregard for traditional academic norms about scholarship and behavior. This could not last long. The CCRU split from Warwick in 1998, long after the university’s philosophy department had grown tired of its antics. According to Andy Beckett, a journalist who chronicled the CCRU’s rise and fall in the Guardian, Land and his remaining followers moved into a home in Leamington formerly owned by prominent British satanist Aleister Crowley, part of an obsession with the occult that had flourished in the accelerationist ranks. Beckett describes a psychologically tortured group that would scribble strange diagrams on the walls of Crowley’s former home. In Fanged Noumena, Land describes his “tool of choice” during his darkest period as “the sacred substance amphetamine ... after perhaps a year of fanatical abuse [I] was, by any reasonable standard, profoundly insane.” After the CCRU’s collapse, its members spread across British academia as well as fields ranging from journalism to music production. Its ideas rose to prominence again in the early 2010s, taking two separate, and opposed political turns. One was left-wing and academic, a school of Marxist thought focusing on how technology can be conscripted toward building a post-capitalist future. The other was right-wing, and in major part a product of Land’s mind. After his breakdown, Land moved to China and became enamored with its techno-authoritarian political system. He worked as a journalist, reporting uncritically and favorably on the Chinese regime’s accomplishments. When I asked him which politicians he admired, he said he’s “not huge on political figures” on the scene today. However, he added, “[Singaporean technocratic authoritarian] Lee Kuan Yew and [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping were greats.” Land turned this admiration for technocratic strongmen into an entire political ideology. Linking up online with the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin — who writes under the pen name Mencius Moldbug — he helped construct the doctrine of “neoreaction,” or NRx, essentially an argument that democracy had outlived its usefulness. In his 2013 series of essays on the topic, titled The Dark Enlightenment, Land argues that the ideal state is a capitalist monarchy described as “gov-corp,” the state-controlled by an authoritarian CEO organizing policy according to the dictates of “rational corporate governance.” It was essentially a hard-right spin on accelerationism. Neoreactionaries argue that egalitarian and democratic policies described as “progressive” by left-liberals are, in fact, a way of slowing down the only progress worth having — acceleration toward techno-capitalist singularity. Neoreaction is a version of accelerationism adapted to address this problem. “Neoreaction is Accelerationism with a flat tire,” Land wrote in a 2013 blog post. “Beside the speed machine, or industrial capitalism, there is an ever more perfectly weighted decelerator ... comically, the fabrication of this braking mechanism is proclaimed as progress. It is the Great Work of the Left.” Though NRx has no mainstream proponents, it does have connections to prominent figures. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly read neoreactionary literature, and Trump-backing venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s fund supported Moldbug’s tech startup Urbit. In emails to right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos obtained by Buzzfeed, Moldbug claimed to be “coaching Thiel,” telling Yiannopoulos that he “watched the [2016] election at [Thiel’s] house ... He’s fully enlightened.” The extreme right-wing internet is a small place. The rise of neoreaction inevitably led it to cross paths with another online fringe movement of the mid-2010s: the alt-right. Members of the two movements didn’t agree on everything: While Land and Moldbug valorize capitalism and see democracy as the major barrier to a better future, alt-right ideologues like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor valorize whiteness and see Jews and non-whites as the problem. Nonetheless, the two shared core ideas, like an emphasis on the role of genetics in creating human hierarchies, that make them comfortable coexisting in the same online spaces. “Although I am not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff,” as Moldbug once put it. (Land is somewhat more critical, writing in The Dark Enlightenment that “the opportunity for viable ethno-supremacist politics disappears into a logical abyss.”) The result is considerable cross-pollination between neoreactionaries and the alt-right. Ideas and terminology crossed the different group lines; some fringe influencers, such as the YouTuber Colin “Millennial Woes” Robertson, have described themselves as being both neoreactionaries and members of the alt-right. A 2018 Southern Poverty Law Center investigation found that several posters on The Right Stuff , an alt-right website, were heavily influenced by neoreaction. “Many of the ideological seeds that would make me open to Hitlerism started with Dark Enlightenment,” one of the posters quoted in the study wrote. This is the most likely means through which the racist movement became introduced to the term “accelerationism.” There’s no meaningful use of the term or attention paid to Land among American racists prior to the alt-right’s encounter with The Dark Enlightenment — and why would there have been? An abstruse techno-capitalist philosophy seems to have little in common with the herrenvolk hatred of the KKK. It wasn’t until the rise of neoreaction and the alt-right — two very online movements that shared members in common — that the encounter would have happened. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that “accelerationism” has displaced the alt-right in the eyes of many internet racists. In popular usage, the “alt-right” is generally taken to refer to racists on the internet. That’s actually a bit imprecise: The alt-right is a specific subset of online racists, one that believes white nationalism can triumph by trolling journalists and staging real-life demonstrations like Charlottesville. The basic model is Hitler and the Nazi party: Win power through democratic elections, then enact your goals. This has long been a controversial strategy in the neo-Nazi community. It had been tried before in the 1950s and 1960s by the American Nazi Party, whose charismatic leader, George Lincoln Rockwell, attempted to turn it into a legitimate force. Rockwell staged a rally on the National Mall, demonstrated against civil rights, and planned marches through Jewish neighborhoods on Jewish holidays. This amounted to very little politically and, in 1967, Rockwell was assassinated by a former member of his own party. The alt-right’s leaders believed the time was right for another try, in large part thanks to Donald Trump and the internet. Trump is seen by the alt-right not as a crypto-Nazi, but as an outsider sympathetic to white nationalist goals. He served as a figurehead, a rallying point that could help them convert larger numbers of Americans to their cause. The internet allowed them to try out their message with a mass audience: memes and trolling and message boards allowed them to bypass media gatekeepers and reach Trump fans who might be receptive to white nationalist ideas directly. Indeed, the combination of Trump’s rise and alt-right online activity did swell the movement’s ranks considerably. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was supposed to be proof of concept, a demonstration that the pro-Trump shitposters could be turned into a real-world political movement. What actually happened was a wave of national revulsion and backlash, particularly after the murder of counterprotester Heather Heyer by a white nationalist. The alt-right lost access to social media platforms, was hounded out of public demonstrations by Antifa, and unequivocally denounced by virtually everyone in American politics (except Trump). The second Unite the Right rally, held in DC in 2018, was a pathetically low-turnout affair. The silver lining for the alt-right — the president’s “very fine people” comment — wasn’t enough to salvage things. Trump, despite all his vicious rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies, had failed to stop what white supremacists see as the existential threat to America: the country’s long-term movement toward becoming a majority-minority country. The alt-right’s theory of change through elections lost favor with others on the white supremacist fringe. “From 2015, when Trump announced and attacked Mexicans that first day, through around Charlottesville, these people really thought they were going to be victorious in the electoral [process] and be able to take a peaceful route back to power,” says Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project. “That has been completely given up on.” This was the moment that neo-Nazi accelerationism really began its rise to prominence — and promote its new and more violent theory of change to supplant the ideas of the “alt-cucks,” as accelerationists derisively termed their white nationalist opponents. Like neoreaction, neo-Nazi accelerationism holds that the liberal-democratic order is a failure — that we should move beyond it toward a better future, and that the task of political action should be to accelerate the speed of that transformation. Only in their view, that “better future” is not capitalist authoritarianism, but the total collapse of a degenerate and corrupt Western society — and the rebirth, out of its ashes, of a new political order more hospitable to white domination. Their main inspiration on how exactly to “accelerate” this process came from James Mason, a previously unheralded neo-Nazi writer who produced a newsletter called Siege in the 1980s. In Siege, Mason uses the collapse of George Lincoln Rockwell’s political strategy to claim that any attempt to work inside the parameters of normal politics was doomed to failure. A better approach, he argued, was pioneered by serial killer Charles Manson — a correspondent of Mason’s who deeply influenced the theories developed in Siege. The murders committed by Manson and his disciples served, in his mind, as a model of decentralized violent action that would be hard for authorities to stop. If neo-Nazis emulated Manson on an individual level, killed and tortured select targets, eventually they could help spur a white uprising against the system — accelerate the pace of a societal collapse already made inevitable by Jewish and non-white corruption, and set the stage for its replacement by a Fourth Reich. “If I were asked by anyone of my opinion on what to look for (or hope for) next I would tell them a wave of killings, or ‘assassinations’ of System bureaucrats by roving gun men who have their strategy well mapped-out in advance and well-nigh impossible to stop,” Mason writes in Siege. “His greatest concern must be to pick his target well so that his act may speak so clearly for itself that no member of White America can mistake its message.” Mason is still alive today. He lives in Denver and looks like an unremarkable bearded white man — that is, when he isn’t wearing his vintage Nazi uniform and a swastika arm band. He languished in obscurity until 2017, when members of the militant neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen tracked him down. The group was founded in 2015 and had long admired him; many of its members were on Iron March, a neo-Nazi web forum that was an early promoter of violent accelerationism. After linking up with Mason in real life, they received his blessing to continue aggressively promoting his ideas, to promote websites with names like Siege Culture aimed at updating Mason’s framework for modern times. The accelerationism they preached centered on heightening the contradictions, using violence both to target their enemies and force a harsh response from the political system — eventually, they hoped, demolishing the state apparatus that stands between us and a white-dominated future. 2017 was a good time for such a doctrine to begin spreading: The alt-right was buckling under post-Charlottesville strains, drawing adherents from those extremists disenchanted with the alt-right’s comparatively cautious approach. They adopted the alt-right’s tactic of trolling and shitposting to popularize their more violent ideas; the phrase “Read Siege” became a meme they pushed on social media. Atomwaffen organized itself into cells: Adherents would meet up at physical “hate camps,” practice with rifles, and plan their next move. Accelerationist ideas flourished separately on social media platforms and extremist web forums like 8chan and Fascist Forge, reaching neo-Nazi groups around the globe. The dedication to violence in accelerationist spaces is scary. They openly fantasize about the need to kill Jews and non-whites and even celebrate ideologically opposed acts of violence — like Islamist terror attacks — as a blow against the system. Though violence is celebrated as the preeminent tactic, they’re willing to endorse non-violent means as well. Accelerationists have proposed distributing flyers for racist rallies alongside ones for a counter-rally, to stoke social division and create conflict. They suggest you should always vote for the most radical candidate in any election, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, to undermine the system’s coherence. One poster I saw even heralded the rise of Bernie Sanders, a Jewish socialist, on the grounds that his proposed expansions of the welfare state would bankrupt the US government and thus undermine its grip on power. In their view, any sort of increase in social tension is good as long as it accelerates us toward system collapse — and individuals have an obligation to do what they can to hasten us along this path. Even, or more precisely, especially committing murder. “I would be willing,” as one Fascist Forge contributor put it, “to use all resources possible for accelerationism.” Starting in 2017, Atomwaffen members began practicing what they preached. From that year on, the group has been publicly linked to at least five killings, including Blaze Bernstein’s. In October 2019, police in Washington arrested Kaleb Cole, believed to be the leader of the state’s Atomwaffen division, and seized eight guns from his residence. They believed he was about to commit a mass shooting. But the thing about accelerationism today is that it does not require any organized plot or group to lead to mass murder. Accelerationist justifications for violence have suffused online white nationalist spaces to the point where anyone can encounter it and draw their own murderous conclusions. “There is an entire subculture of individuals who are promoting this concept, who advocate for sabotage and destruction against the system,” Mendelson, the Anti-Defamation League researcher, says. “It only takes that one individual who’s inspired by the rhetoric on that message board to act.” The internet has allowed James Mason’s original vision, “lone wolf” violence, to become a reality, not just in the United States but globally: Accelerationism seems to have played a role in the March 2019 Christchurch shooter’s decision to gun down Muslims while they prayed.  Christchurch shooter Brenton Tarrant’s motivation was a mix of hate and fear: Like all contemporary white supremacists, he believed non-white population growth was an existential threat to his race. His manifesto is titled “The Great Replacement,” a term coined by a French writer but in context refers to the theory of “white genocide” by demography that goes back decades in the white supremacist movement. Tarrant’s plan for stopping white genocide drew liberally from accelerationist ideas; he literally titled a section of the manifesto “Destabilization and Accelerationism: tactics for victory.” “Why did you carry out the attack? ... To add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilizing and polarizing Western society in order to eventually destroy the current nihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity that has taken control of Western thought,” he writes. “The change we need to enact only arises in the great crucible of crisis.” It’s difficult to overstate the influence of Tarrant’s attack and manifesto on the internet’s racist right. The Christchurch shooting claimed 51 lives, one of the deadliest white supremacist terror attacks in modern history. The sheer violence of the assault on New Zealand’s small Muslim community turned his manifesto into a must-read on the racist right — and made accelerationism into one of the dominant ideas on the fringe right today.  “Atomwaffen was a relatively insular universe. When the Christchurch shooter starts describing this, it makes a big jump to the wider consciousness of the white supremacist movement,” the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Beirich says. “That clear statement of accelerationism in the Christchurch shooter’s manifesto took this to another level. Now, pretty much everybody on the radical right has read this stuff, imbibed this stuff — and he put it into the public domain for white supremacists.” In April, about a month after Christchurch, a man named John Earnest entered a synagogue in Poway, California, and began firing on worshippers. Earnest’s manifesto is a mix of old-school Christian anti-Semitism and internet-era hatred; the manifesto cites both Tarrant and 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers as inspiration, but seems particularly inspired by Tarrant’s writing (“Tarrant was a catalyst for me personally,” he writes). At one point, Earnest explicitly borrows a clearly accelerationist idea from Tarrant’s manifesto: the idea that using a gun in an attack could hasten the state’s collapse by stoking conflict over gun control. “I used a gun for the same reason that Brenton Tarrant used a gun,” he writes. “The goal is for the US government to start confiscating guns. People will defend their right to own a firearm — civil war has just started.” Several months after Christchurch and Poway, a third white nationalist named Patrick Crusius shot up a Walmart in El Paso, specifically targeting Hispanic patrons. Like Tarrant, Crusius was obsessed with the idea of a demographic threat from non-white immigrants. He pledged his allegiance to the New Zealand killer’s way of thinking. “I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto,” he wrote in a pre-attack screed. “The Hispanic community was not my target before I read The Great Replacement.” It’s tricky to say definitively that accelerationism “caused” Blaze Bernstein’s murder, other acts of Atomwaffen violence, or the three white supremacist mass shootings of 2019. There is almost always a complex web of personal reasons for why an individual chooses to kill; It’s possible they would have turned violent regardless of what ideas they were exposed to. The influence of accelerationism is clearer in some of the killers’ writings than in others (Crusius’s manifesto, in particular, doesn’t seem too indebted to the theory). Accelerationism is a diffuse idea, and it’s best to think of its influence as such. Neo-Nazis didn’t need accelerationism to be violent, but rather the doctrine’s omnipresence in online far-right spaces makes it more likely that both groups and individuals are inspired to embrace terrorism as a tactic. The frequent expressions of support for violence increase the baseline risk that someone turns to it. “As late as Dylann Roof [the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter], the reaction of white supremacists was kind of ambivalent,” says Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League. “Now ... they want more people like that to emerge.” It’s hard to even say how many spaces there are encouraging that process. Atomwaffen is not the only organized group promoting accelerationism; other groups whose ideas fit the doctrine are the Bowl Gang, a small group of online propagandists who lionize Roof; and The Base, a trans-Atlantic neo-Nazi umbrella group that explicitly aims to turn online chatter into real-world violence. These groups have also largely moved beyond open web forums like Iron March, Fascist Forge, and the now-shuttered 8chan. You can find their content on major social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter, but most of it has to be masked or heavily censored in order to avoid bans. (One accelerationist video I watched on YouTube bleeped out the word “Nazi” in the narration in an effort to dodge the censors.) The real hubs of accelerationist activity are secure messaging platforms like Telegram, apps that are harder for law enforcement to surveil and easier to keep free of outside influence. Journalists and professional hate-watchers have gotten access to their channels, but it’s impossible to know exactly how many are operating outside of anyone’s view. Barring federal regulations weakening the encryption protections for these platforms — a proposal that raises serious privacy and data security concerns — it may not be possible to effectively keep tabs on what accelerationists are saying to each other and what they’re planning. White supremacist violence tends to come in waves, with high-profile killings typically inspiring copycats until the movement is exhausted. In that sense, the current wave of accelerationist-influenced violence is hardly unprecedented. But this is the first such wave in the era of internet ubiquity and is largely made up of young, digital-native men. Accelerationists instinctively understand that their statements and actions can rapidly reach a planetary audience. They are exploiting the speed of life under late capitalism to spread hate to the masses, a dark parody of the techno-capitalist singularity posited by CCRU theorists in the early 1990s. In our correspondence, Nick Land told me that “the assumption” behind accelerationism was that “the general direction of [techno-capitalist] self-escalating change was toward decentralization.” It seems that this was partly correct — but in a far more horrifying way than anyone at the time could have anticipated.

Andrew Cuomo. While racist provocation on college campuses is nothing new, the volume of back-to-back incidents and the means through which theyâve been communicated has led to an uproar, with students refusing to attend class and even leaving campus. The incidents in question began two weeks ago, when students discovered racist graffiti targeting African Americans and Asians scrawled in a bathroom on campus. Shortly after, a swastika was discovered drawn in the snow near a residence hall. Then, last Friday, a Chinese student reported that heâd been called a racial slur while leaving his dorm; after that, an African-American student was called a âverbal racial epithet,â according to Kent Syverud, chancellor of the university, in an incident involving members of a fraternity. Syverudâs response to the last episode was to suspend all fraternity activity for the rest of the semester. ""While only one fraternity may have been involved in this particular incident, given recent history, all fraternities must come together with the university community to reflect upon how to prevent recurrence of such seriously troubling behavior,"" he said in a statement. He also announced that a âgenerous donorâ had offered a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest of whoever was responsible. âIt went from vandalism to students of color actively being harassed,â Syracuse freshman Jenna Swetland, who is Asian, told The Washington Post. âItâs getting worse.â These incidents â reportedly 11 of them in total â caught Cuomoâs attention. On Nov. 11, he called for an investigation into the bathroom graffiti; on Tuesday, he suggested that an independent body should probe Syracuseâs ongoing hate incidents. He also threw doubt on Syverudâs ability to remedy the situation, saying that the incidents âhave not been handled in a manner that reflects this state's aggressive opposition to such odious, reckless, reprehensible behavior. That these actions should happen on the campus of a leading New York university makes this situation even worse.â The past few weeks have created a climate of tension and anger on campus. A group of students has been camping out in a campus building as part of a protest theyâre calling #NotAgainSU. Others have left campus amid feelings of anxiety around the rash of racist activity. And early Tuesday morning, someone threw a match into this powder keg. According to the Post, a group of students were studying in the library when they suddenly received an AirDrop notification that theyâd been anonymously sent a document. The enclosed file contained the manifesto written by the man who attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. In the document, the man writes about the so-called Great Replacement, the racist and anti-immigrant conspiracy theory he used as justification for killing 51 people in a live-streamed mass shooting. The Post said the document was also posted on a Syracuse-affiliated web forum alongside the message, âWe must secure the existence of our people a future for white children,â which invokes the infamous â14 wordsâ neo-Nazi slogan. The library incident caused panic because it underscored the previously only existentially known truth: The person or people spreading these hateful messages were closeby in the Syracuse community. AirDropping depends on Bluetooth proximity, so whoever sent the manifesto to the studying students had to have been physically in the vicinity of the library. Students left campus and skipped class, afraid of a mass shooting; professors also canceled classes. âSyracuse University campus is looking extra empty this morning,â tweeted Josh Meyers, a student journalist on campus. âStudents are scared for their own safety.â Even Vice President Joe Biden, who has made combatting white nationalism a top priority of his 2020 presidential campaign, tweeted about events at Syracuse, noting that he received his law degree there. âWe are truly in a battle for the soul of this nation, and it requires all of us to stand up together as a country against racism and bigotry. We must give hate no safe harbor.â Whether it was the work of a troll, a true believer in white nationalist ideology, or both, the AirDrop incident terrified the campus. Thereâs nothing new about the content of these hateful messages, but there is a degree of technology-enabled viciousness at play at Syracuse that underscores the terrifying ease with which one person can now terrorize another. Itâs another piece in the increasingly dystopian puzzle of modern digital life, where as soon as new technology emerges it's disturbingly misused; think China censoring pro-Hong Kong messages on TikTok while mass shooters livestream murder on Twitch. Even if the perpetrator at Syracuse is eventually caught and expelled, their use of AirDrop to spread violent messages is a frightening example of information terrorism. Students at campuses around the country are already on edge due to seemingly constant mass shootings; meanwhile, college campuses are hotspots for white nationalist activism, as evidenced by the âgroyper warsâ at right-wing campus events across the country. Syracuseâs problems portend an ugly future ahead for students. In a campus environment stained by fear and hatred, where mass shootings are almost a routine feature of life and white nationalism is a public force, mass panic can now be sparked by anyone at the push of a button.",2019-11-20 00:00:00,Syracuse's racism scandal foreshadows the chilling future ahead,,109076,http://mic.com/
381,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/virginia-elections.html?module=inline,"Advertisement Supported by With a Democratic governor in office, the party was in full control of Virginia state government for the first time in a generation. By Trip Gabriel Democrats completed Virginia’s historic partisan shift from red to blue on Tuesday, winning majorities in both chambers of the legislature and consolidating power across state government for the first time in a generation. In an election where passions about President Trump and the impeachment inquiry drove voters on both sides, a revolt against the president in Virginia’s rapidly growing suburbs helped remake the state’s political map. Now, under Gov. Ralph Northam, who survived scandal earlier this year, Democrats are positioned to advance a set of sweeping liberal priorities. Going into Tuesday, Republicans held a 20 to 19 advantage in the State Senate and a 51 to 48 edge in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each chamber. Democrats picked up at least two Senate seats, including an upset in a suburban Richmond district by Ghazala Hashmi, who will be the first Muslim woman in the Senate. A former college literature professor, Ms. Hashmi was brought to the country from India as a child. Running her first campaign, she described experiencing a personal crisis after Mr. Trump ordered a ban on immigration from Muslim-majority countries. “I didn’t know if I actually had a home in this country,” she said in an interview before the voting. “My anxiety was caused by wondering if other people would speak up and support the assault we were seeing on civil liberties.” She decided to speak up and represent herself. Other notable winners on Tuesday included Shelly Simonds, a Democrat who lost a House race in 2017 in a random drawing after the votes produced a dead tie. In a rematch, Ms. Simonds defeated the Republican incumbent, David Yancey. Chris Jones, the powerful Republican head of the House appropriations committee, was upset by Clint Jenkins, a small-business owner. And Tim Hugo, the last Republican in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, lost to Dan Helmer in a district that has become more than a quarter Asian and Hispanic — emblematic of the demographic shifts in the state that have remade Virginia, once the seat of the Confederacy. After gaining 15 seats in the House in 2017, Democrats this year picked up at least another five, a signal that the state’s blue groundswell had lost little momentum in the third year of the Trump presidency. The ultimate size of the new Democratic majorities was in flux late Tuesday as a few close races were undecided. “When the House convenes in January, we will welcome new members on both sides of the aisle, and, for the first time in two decades, a new party will sit in the majority,’’ Kirk Cox, the outgoing Republican speaker of the House, who won re-election, said in a statement. In the days ahead of Election Day, Republicans warned direly that conservatives faced an existential crisis, in which they could lose the Virginia they had known, while Democrats argued their opponents had too long tried to block progress on issues like Medicaid expansion, a higher minimum wage and gun safety. Pre-election polling showed the top issues were all ones that favored Democrats: raising the minimum wage to $15, spending more on roads and, especially, after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach this year, expanding background checks and banning assault weapons. After Mr. Northam called a special session in of the legislature in July to respond to gun violence, and the Republican majorities adjourned it after just 90 minutes, Democrats thought they had won a moral victory to use against opponents in the fall. Republicans denounced the session as a political stunt. “The era of Republican obstruction in the Commonwealth of Virginia is now over,’’ former Gov. Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. “While tonight we celebrate the history we have made, tomorrow we must begin rewarding voters with action.” Just months ago, Democrats seemed badly wounded heading into an election year as scandal engulfed Mr. Northam and the other top two Democrats in the state. After a racist photo on Mr. Northam’s medical school yearbook page surfaced in February, he initially acknowledged that he was in the photo. He quickly reversed himself. The party was soon thrown further into turmoil, as two women accused Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax of sexual assault, which he denied. But the headlines faded, offering Republicans less ammunition than they once expected. Recent polls show more voters approve of the governor’s performance than disapprove. The balance of power in both chambers turned on just a handful of competitive districts, all in suburban regions outside Washington, Richmond and in Hampton Roads. Swing-district Republicans backpedaled away from Mr. Trump and the party, a brand that had proved toxic in last year’s midterms with the increasingly diverse electorate in suburbia. Some Republicans campaigned more like Democrats, boasting of support for Medicaid expansion that the party long fought in Richmond, for L.G.B.T. rights and even for gun safety measures. With so much at stake — a referendum on the president, the partisan balance of both houses, political momentum going into a presidential election — money cascaded into the normally low-interest legislative races. More than $1 million flowed to 16 individual candidates, who were seeking part-time jobs that pay less than $20,000 a year. Races where television ads had been unheard-of echoed with a cacophony of attacks while Virginians tried to tune out politics for a brief respite during the World Series. Emily’s List, which supports women running for office who back abortion rights, pumped more than $2 million into Democratic races mostly for the House. The former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was the largest outside individual donor. His group Everytown for Gun Safety gave $2.5 million to help Democrats, and Beyond Carbon, his climate change group, donated more than $600,000 to two House candidates in coastal districts. Republicans’ largest donor was the Republican State Leadership Committee ($3.2 million), a national group that supports state-level races, the value of which became clear after sweeping Republican legislative victories in 2010, which led to Republican-drawn voting maps that have influenced power in the states and in Congress. State senators, who serve four-year terms, had not faced voters since 2015, before Mr. Trump’s election. Many Republican senators who were considered most vulnerable occupied districts carried by Mr. Northam in 2017 and by three Democrats who flipped congressional races in 2018. Another factor aiding Democrats was a court-ordered remapping of districts in southeast Virginia. In June, the United States Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision striking down earlier maps as racially gerrymandered. New maps shifted 425,000 voters in 25 districts. They more evenly distributed black voters, which gave Democrats an overall advantage, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. This year, the prospect of the 2021 redistricting after the next census was a quiet but powerful issue for both parties. In recent days, nationally prominent Democrats campaigned alongside statehouse candidates to raise voters’ enthusiasm, including the presidential candidates Joseph R. Biden Jr., Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris. On Saturday, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, sought to inspire volunteer door-knockers by citing what he viewed as Republican outrages in Washington, including Mr. Trump’s abandonment of Kurdish allies in Syria and smears against a decorated Army officer called to testify in the impeachment inquiry. He suggested Democrats could force congressional Republicans to “grow a backbone” by flipping the Virginia House and Senate. Republican surrogates were less visible. Mr. Trump skipped campaigning for fellow Republicans in the state, though Vice President Mike Pence held a rally in Virginia Beach. At a get-out-the-vote gathering on Saturday for the Henrico County Republican Committee, once a Republican stronghold outside Richmond, the headliner was a local talk radio host, John Reid. “I think Democrats have overreached beyond belief,” Mr. Reid told the party faithful, referring to impeachment proceedings. He predicted Republicans would have a good day on Tuesday. “Donald Trump upsets people — that’s fine,” he said. “It cannot be denied that he’s delivered.” Advertisement",2019-11-06 02:43:21,Virginia Election: Democrats Take Full Control of State Government - The New York Times,,1,http://nytimes.com

Cory Booker's floundering 2020 presidential bid shows how simply being likable may not be enough to win an election. According to Insider polling, 59% of Democratic voters know who Booker is and 34% of them say they would be satisfied with him as the nominee. What's more, about 20% of Democratic primary voters overall say they would be satisfied with Booker as the nominee. Despite all that support, the 50-year-old senator is polling at just about 3% in the latest Morning Consult poll. That's good for sixth place. In fact, Booker's campaign has hovered between 2% and 5% support for the past 10 months. Several times each month since last December, Insider asked more than 1,100 respondents about the Democratic field, specifically whether they'd be satisfied or unsatisfied with each of the known primary candidates as the nominee. More details on what we poll and what we ask can be found here. If Booker was looking for love, then that plan largely worked! Just about everyone planning to vote in the Democratic primary really does appear to like Booker, even if he's not their first choice. Nearly a third of former Vice President Joe Biden's supporters say they like Booker, according to Insider polling, while 25.7% of Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters like Booker. Among Sen. Elizabeth Warren's supporters the love is even greater for Booker, at 32%. Even the supporters of candidates polling worse than him, who would presumably have an even greater incentive to see Booker fail, still like him. Sixty-nine percent of voters in support of Julián Castro, for example, say they like Booker. While being acceptable to everyone may seem like a strength, it may also be a weakness. Voters who say they are satisfied with Booker, according to Insider polling, are satisfied, on average with six other candidates. Compare that with Sanders supporters, who as of last month on average said they were satisfied with only three other candidates. That leaves Booker in the undesirable position of being universally liked but with very little die-hard support. To use a tired metaphor: Booker is like the Heineken of Democratic presidential candidates. There's also some evidence of trouble brewing among the cohort of Democratic voters in Booker's camp. Of the 527 respondents who said they liked Booker in Insider's most recent poll, a staggering 80% of them also said they liked Warren. While Warren's campaign has seemingly stepped off the gas in recent weeks, the Massachusetts senator has locked herself in as a top-tier candidate. If eight out of every 10 Booker candidates also like Warren, how much longer are they willing to be pulled along by a candidate polling at 3% before they decide to cut and run? The answer to that question may hedge strongly on whether Booker makes a splash in Wednesday's Democratic debate. For the entirety of his campaign, Booker has made a clear, explicit attempt to brand himself as ""the love candidate."" A New York magazine cover story on Booker released in September last year described Booker's senate offices as happy, jolly, and filled with exuberant staffers handing out candy and smiles. The word ""love"" was used 12 times in that story. While Booker has largely claimed the mantle of the love candidate, he's not the only one on the campaign trail to try it. Over the past 10 months, the back-bench candidate Marianne Williamson, the early exiter Beto O'Rourke, and the out-of-nowhere surprise success story Pete Buttigieg have all flirted with some form of a nonnegative campaign. O'Rourke, for example, started his presidential campaign by taking the moral high road and refusing to engage in personal attacks against both fellow Democrats and Republicans. ""This is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us, that seeks to unite a very divided country,"" O'Rourke cheerily said during his announcement video. Almost immediately, O'Rourke's support plummeted. That steep declined would be halted only in August, following a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, when O'Rourke emotionally spoke out against assault-style weapons, hurled expletives, and openly called President Donald Trump a white supremacist. O'Rourke's pivot away from positivity coincided with a brief resurgence in the polls, but it was too little too late. By November 1, O'Rourke had dropped out. Buttigieg, whose early campaign was similarly positive and noncombative, has pivoted sharply. From April to October, the percentage of people aware of Buttigieg who supported him dropped to 49% from 62%, setting off alarm bells among his supporters. In the October CNN/New York Times debate, Buttigieg went in swinging and attacked Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy, chided O'Rourke on gun policy, and prodded Warren to ask whether her ""Medicare for All"" plan would increase middle-class taxes. The plan worked. Buttigieg is now by some accounts a top-tier candidate. Then there's Williamson, who has said she's ""going to harness a love for political purposes."" Williamson is tied for dead last and has been for months. All of those cases potentially leave Booker facing a troubling trajectory. The senator has worked hard, and succeeded, in becoming a well-known and well-liked name. He has few enemies, and Democratic voters, regardless of who their first choice is, tend to really like Booker. But they just don't like him enough to be their first choice. And with a field of 16 candidates (and potentially more joining in) being likable, or even lovable, isn't enough to stand out from the crowd.

And besides, even if Drum finds California laws meager, they’re still more stringent than the ones Democrats want to pass in D.C.

Drum writes: You might also want to note that whenever there’s a mass shooting, then by definition the laws currently on the books didn’t stop it. Ditto for murder, robbery, rape, carjacking, and so forth. You can play this juvenile game forever. Pay no attention to it. “[M]urder, robbery, rape, carjacking” are criminal acts. A gun is a tool, not an act, and owning one is a right. If laws passed to alleviate “murder, robbery, rape, carjacking” limited the liberties of victims but empowered criminals, we’d be paying attention. Drum also asks someone to ask me why I put scare quotes around the word “slaughter.” (No problem. I’m a pretty accessible guy!) First, because Chris Murphy uses the word to scaremonger the issue by absurdly accusing Mitch McConnell of enabling shooters. As noted above, California proves that the Democratic bill on McConnell’s desk would do little but inhibit law-abiding citizens from practicing their Constitutional right (which, let’s face it, is point of many of these restrictions). Second, Murphy uses the word “slaughter” to demagogue and create moral panic. Communities need to do more to figure out how to stop broken people from committing horrifying acts, but the chances of a child being shot in an American school over the past 20 years is somewhere around 1 in 600,000,000. Your child has a far higher chance of choking, drowning, falling down the stairs, or being in a car accident than of being involved a school shooting. Schools are safer today than they were 20 years ago. Gun homicides are at near-historic lows. Using phrases like “the slaughter of our children” or “epidemic of gun violence” is hyperbolic and deployed only to create hysteria for political reasons.

Drum writes that: After any mass shooting, the inevitable conservative reply is “Nothing Dems are proposing would have stopped this particular mass shooting anyway.” He adds: The obvious answer is to pass laws that might actually make a difference, but unfortunately conservatives unanimously oppose them all. And: You might also want to note that whenever there’s a mass shooting, then by definition the laws currently on the books didn’t stop it. Ditto for murder, robbery, rape, carjacking, and so forth. You can play this juvenile game forever. Pay no attention to it. The trouble with this line of argument is that it bears no relation whatsoever to how Democrats, gun-control activists, and pro-regulation journalists actually characterize their coveted laws. Why do conservatives point out that the current set of laws didn’t stop “this particular” shooting? Why do they note that nothing that has been proposed would have prevented it either? Simple: Because those who want to change the rules invariably claim otherwise. The shooting in Santa Clarita provided a perfect example of this tendency. Immediately — immediately — we were told that it was “time” to pass “universal background checks” — which . . . California already has, and which didn’t factor in anyway. Immediately — immediately – we were told that it was time to pass an “assault weapons” ban — which . . . California already has, and which didn’t factor in anyway because an “assault weapon” wasn’t used. Why were we told it was time to do these things? Why, to make sure that Santa Clarita, which was not stopped by either measure, “never happens again.” This is not my inference; it was made explicit. Within minutes of the news breaking, we were told that the NRA and Mitch McConnell had “blood on their hands” because they had not helped to pass the aforementioned laws at the federal level. To make this connection explicit, Senator Chris Murphy and others drew a hard connection between the events in Santa Clarita and the lack of action in the Senate. That there was no link between the two seems not to have bothered him one whit. Did it bother Kevin Drum? It doesn’t seem to have. Drum happily concedes that “whenever there’s a mass shooting, then by definition the laws currently on the books didn’t stop it,” and he’s obviously smart enough to understand that the laws that Murphy and co. are proposing to impose federally are the same ones as are already on the books in California. And yet he reserves his ire for . . . the people who point this out. Why? Indeed, Drum seems primarily to be annoyed by “conservatives” who do not want to “to pass laws that,” in his view, “might actually make a difference.” Given his politics, this is understandable. But shouldn’t he be even more annoyed with the non-conservatives who routinely propose things that Drum concedes don’t matter? Whatever one thinks of us, David Harsanyi and I are extremely open about our views on gun control. Chris Murphy, by contrast, is a weasel. Were Murphy an honest broker, he would say “the laws I am peddling did not work in California, and do not have much to do with most mass shootings, and so, inspired by Kevin Drum, I am going to propose a far more draconian set of regulations that directly intersect with the cases that I intend to use to sell them.” But he won’t. Instead, like Pavlov’s senator he’ll react to each and every case in the same way: by pretending that his proposed solutions have anything to do with the ill to which he’s pointing. And Kevin Drum, instead of calling him out for it, will be sure to berate those who have the gall to notice the trick.  Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

Forty years ago, a gang of Klansmen and Nazis murdered five communists in broad daylight. America has never been the same. By SHAUN ASSAEL and PETER KEATING November 03, 2019 Shaun Assael is a New York Times-bestselling author. He can be seen in a documentary based on his latest book, The Murder of Sonny Liston, at 9 p.m. on Nov. 15 on Showtime. Peter Keating is an investigative writer in Montclair, N.J. âDeath to the Klan!â On Saturday, November 3, 1979, that chant swept over Morningside Homes, a mostly black housing project in Greensboro, North Carolina, as dozens of protestersâsome donning blue hard hats for protectionâhammered placards onto signposts and danced in the morning sun. The American left had largely given up on communism by then, but these demonstrators were full-on Maoists. Their ranks included professionals with degrees from places like Harvard and Duke. And they were descending on Greensboro, a city where sit-ins helped launch the civil rights movement in 1960, to ignite another revolution. They danced to a guitar player singing, âWoke up this morning with my mind set to build the Party.â Their children dressed in tan military shirts and red berets. They even brought an effigy of a Klansman, dressed in a white sheet and hood, which kids from the neighborhood joined in punching. The communists planned to begin their march at noon, moving from the housing project to a local shopping center. But just after 11:20, a caravan filled with real Klansmen and Nazis surprised them, snaking through the neighborhoodâs narrow byways. As the protesters stood their ground, a man in a white T-shirt leaned out the passenger window of a canary-yellow pickup truck, and yelled, âYou asked for the Klan. Now you got âem!â The station wagon behind him carried four Nazis. Seven more vehicles followed, carrying nearly 30 more men, including an Imperial Wizard of the Klan. What happened next took just 88 seconds, but still reverberates 40 years later. In a confrontation where white supremacists began firing pistols, rifles and shotguns, and with television cameras rolling but police nowhere to be found, five communists were shot dead in broad daylight. Ten others were injured, some left to lie bleeding in the streets.

Bottom right: A man comforts his wife after the shooting. | Greensboro News & Record But that November morning became momentous for more than the grotesque video footage that still lives on the Internet: The Greensboro Massacre, as it became known, was the coming-out bloodbath for the white nationalist movement that is upending our politics today. Before Greensboro, Americaâs most lurid extremists largely operated in separate, mutually distrustful spheres. Greensboro was the place where the farthest-right groups of white supremacy learned to kill together. After November 3, 1979, it was suddenly possible to imagine Confederate flags flying alongside swastikas in Charlottesville. Or a teenager like Dylann Roof hoarding Nazi drawings as well as a Klan hood in his bedroom while he plotted mass murder. Today, white nationalism is closer to the mainstream of American politics than ever before. The far rightâs fears about âreplacementâ of the white race and outsider âinvasionsâ have become standard tropes at conservative media outlets, and its anger is routinely stoked by the president of the United States. At the same time, right-wing violence is on the rise: Far-right terrorists accounted for the overwhelming majority of extremist murders in the U.S. last year, according to a January report by the Anti-Defamation League. The seeds for this iteration of white supremacy were planted 40 years ago in Greensboro, when the white wedding of Klansmen and Nazis launched a new, pan-right extremismâa toxic brew of virulent racism, anti-government rhetoric, apocalyptic fearmongering and paramilitary tactics. And this extremism has proven more durable than anyone then could imagine. *** Segregationists of the Greatest Generation, who fought German soldiers on the battlefields of World War II, would have thought it beyond preposterous for the Klan and Nazis to make common cause. Adolf Hitler drew inspiration from Jim Crow, but American southerners strongly supported going to war against Nazi Germany. In 1946, a list of American Nazi Party members, obtained by the U.S. Army, showed that just two percent lived in the South. Nazis were dedicated to the violent overthrow of the government, as part of their program of genocidal fascism. Through the 1950s, most neo-Confederates considered themselves patriotic Americans and had faith in the U.S. political system, even as they believed in and practiced white supremacy. But many southern traditionalists experienced the upheavals of the next two decades as a series of betrayals. By the mid-1970s, federal courts had embraced civil rights, and civic and business leaders were dismantling legal segregation. Manufacturing, textile and tobacco jobs were vanishing. Politicians on the cosmopolitan left and corporate right were abandoning blue-collar voters. Vietnam veterans were coming home unappreciated and embittered. In addition, the FBI, after years of pursuing black nationalists, began infiltrating and undermining local Ku Klux Klans through a program, largely forgotten today, called COINTELPRO-White Hate. To be sure, only a small fraction of angry southerners turned to terror groups. But the Klanâs membership grew in the â70s, and so did its public support. Gallup reported in 1979 that 11 percent of white Americans viewed the KKK favorably, up from just six percent in 1965. And with that rebound came something more: Those who were susceptible to recruitment were far more likely than their parents or grandparents to see the U.S. government itself as an alien force bent on destroying the white way of life.

Bottom: A secret gathering of Klansmen in 1950s Georgia. | Wikimedia Commons; AP Photo; Getty Images Meanwhile, American Nazis were expanding their public presence. Some younger would-be fuhrers began trading armbands for sport coats and toning down their rhetoric in media appearances in order to seem more palatable. Other Nazi leaders, like William Pierce, head of the white separatist National Alliance, started looking for partners and muscle, hoping to turn far-right fanatics from vigilantes to insurrectionists. In 1978, Pierce published The Turner Diaries, a futurist fantasy-cum-blueprint for all-out race war. In Pierceâs novel, oppressed whites join forces to create an underground organization that bombs New York and murders thousands of black and Jewish people, among many other horrific acts; the bookâs protagonist ultimately flies a nuclear warhead into the Pentagon. The Turner Diaries was a huge hit with the far right, and has influenced a wide spectrum of racistsâand inspired notorious hate crimesâever since. It wasnât just avowed racists who gravitated to new extremes. In the weird, unusually rootless time between Watergate and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, Americaâs faith in public institutions collapsed, cynicism soared and belief in a wide range of conspiracy theories and cults, from UFOs to the Unification Church, sprouted in popularity. But those rooted in racial resentment took hold in especially bitter soil. White supremacists of all stripes came to believe they faced annihilation, and they prepared to fight it on the home front. The country, in other words, was primed for a fusion of the ultra-right. *** The story of the Greensboro Massacre really begins with an episode that occurred in the summer of 1979, in a tiny, working-class city 60 miles to the southwest, called China Grove. Klan leaders in North Carolina had spent the first half of the year stepping up their recruitment efforts by appealing to the heritage of white supremacy. The Federated Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, for example, staged a historical exhibit at the Forsyth County Libraryâand in an early sign of what was to come, a group of Nazis showed up to ogle the items on view, surprising the media. On July 8, the same North Carolina Klan faction tried to screen The Birth of a Nation, the 1915 racist epic that depicts heroic figures in white hoods trying to beat back the scourge of Reconstruction at the turn of the century, at the China Grove Community Center. But before they could show the movie, more than a hundred protesters, led by communists from Durham and Greensboro, marched on the building, chanting âDeath to the Klan!â and âDecease the rotten beast.â Many carried pipes and chains. The Grand Dragon of the Federated Knights, a pot-bellied mason named Joe Grady, stood on the porch outside the building with some 20 men in robes and white-power t-shirts, rifles drawn, while members of the China Grove police force struggled to create a human buffer. Gradyâs men were eager to fire on the crowd, but a policeman who walked up to him whispered that if they did, the officers trying to keep the peace were the ones who would get hurt. Grady reluctantly agreed to move into the musty bingo hall, where women and children who had been watching the approaching crowd were hiding. Once the Klansmen retreated, a cheer rose up from the protesters, who burned a pair of Confederate flags. Afterwards, once the crowd was gone and the screening cancelled, Grady re-emerged to face the news cameras. Grabbing a shred of burned flag, he vowed, âThere will be revenge for this.â But while Grady put on a brave face for the remaining television cameras, in the eyes of his hooded peers, he had committed a cardinal sin. He had allowed himself to look weak. By that point, the Klanâs resurgence was already triggering confrontations around the country. In Decatur, Alabama, in May 1979, more than a hundred armed Klansmen blocked a civil rights march. Later, that August, rock-throwing protesters pelted Klansmen at an anti-immigration meeting in Castro Valley, California. None of those episodes led to lethal retaliatory violence, however. China Grove was different because it got the attention of a young Nazi named Harold Covington. Born about 20 miles east of Greensboro, Covington had attended an integrated high school in Chapel Hill, where he proudly called himself the âschool fascist.â Jowly and glib, Covington traveled to South Africa where he built a minor reputation as a soldier-for-hire whoâd taken up arms to defend apartheid. By the time he resettled in North Carolina and launched a losing but surprisingly well-run campaign for Raleigh city council, Covington had become an articulate, publicity-seeking ideologue, with a sideline writing campy novelsâa kind of L. Ron Hubbard of the racist resistance. Left: Virgil Griffin speaks at a KKK rally at the North Carolina State Capitol in 1973. Right: Harold Covington. | Getty; Courtesy of SPLC With a sense of himself as a global figure, Covington regarded most Klansmen he met as boorish. The backlash to China Grove convinced him they were also in disarray. And Covington saw no one in the back-country klaverns of North Carolina capable of stepping into the void. Long before he would become a YouTube provocateur by posting white-power videos online, Covington decided to herd them into a single white-power army himself. In a preview of 8Chan, the message-board website that would become a haven for white nationalists in the 2010s, he began bringing together various strains of supremacists, or as he put it, ânormalizing relations.â His early attempts didnât go well. The few Klan members he was able to woo were largely fabulists who made up stories to make themselves seem more violent than they really were. Deciding he needed to get a better cut, Covington organized a racist retreat on September 22 at a borrowed farm outside Louisburg, about 30 miles northeast of Raleigh, and sent word through the bars, garages and diners where âhis peopleâ hung out that they were all invited. With the media dutifully attending what promised to be a freakshow, no detail was too small for Covington to stage-manage. Kids milled around a barbecue pit where a whole hog roasted, while parents doused a huge cross in kerosene. Nazis wore uniforms budgeted at $25 for tailored pants, $10 for boots and $2 for arm bands. The sound system alternated bluegrass tunes and âThe Ride of the Valkyries.â A cute blonde in a âWhite Powerâ t-shirt sauntered with a Doberman and a rifle for photographers. In a crib, a baby wore a small shirt that read âFuture Klansman.â For extra inspiration, a noose hung from a tree. Late in the afternoon, a caravan of 20 Klansmen pulled into the farm led by a gaunt mechanic with a plunging jawline named Virgil Griffin. Griffin carried the title of Imperial Wizard of a backwoods klavern known as the Invisible Empire in Mount Holly, close to the South Carolina border. But he was also something of a joke on the national stage. His rallies, unlike Covingtonâs barbecue, were often threadbare affairs that dissolved into chaos. At one event, heâd been shouted down by protesters singing the theme song from âThe Mickey Mouse Club,â according to an account from a community journalist, Elizabeth Wheaton, who covered radical politics around Greensboro. If Covington looked in the mirror and saw a worldwide revolutionary, Griffin viewed himself as a backwoods patriot. After the China Grove debacle, he concluded that local Klans needed better leadership and more action, and believed he could provide both. Covington was only too happy to help feed such ambitions, elaborately making the Imperial Wizard feel like an honored guest among the other extremistsâwho also included the Klansmen who had peeled off from the Gradyâs Federated Knights after China Grove, and a Nazi-curious crew from Winston-Salem. The extremists nattered about where to buy guns and how to deal with the summer heatâKlan robes were sweatier than Nazi uniforms. And they found common ground. âYou take a man who fought in the Second World War, itâs hard for him to sit down in a room full of swastikas,â a Klansman told the Associated Press, which published a report about the event called âNorth Carolina United Racist Front Forms.â Then he added: âBut people realize time is running out. Weâre going to have to get together.â *** What Virgil Griffin didnât know was that one of his closest allies was keeping the cops informed about this new alliance. Unlike the years after 9/11 when American law enforcement took its focus off white nationalism to fight Islamist terror, the 1960s and â70s were a period of robust intelligence-gathering in the supremacist underground. One of North Carolinaâs most charismatic Klansmen, a car salesman named Bob Jones who recruited 12,000 members to his state chapter, was undone by an aide whose information led to him being dragged before Congress and held in contempt. In the case of Griffin, law enforcementâs material came from a chain-smoking handyman named Eddie Dawson. Born in New Jersey, Dawson cut an odd figure for a Southern Klansman. He spoke with a twitchy northern accent and had an uncanny resemblance to the Hollywood actor William Holden. Having drifted down to Greensboro in the early â60sâa time when black activists were staging sit-ins at segregated lunch countersâhe managed to get invited to a meeting of the Klan, and quickly established himself as an enthusiastic recruit. In one career-building episode, he took an armed joy ride through a poor black neighborhood that he peppered with rifle fire. Dawson, however, blamed the KKK for letting him get sentenced to nine months in jail after he was convicted of assault with intent to kill for the joy ride. He was still bitter when an FBI agent approached him at a coffee shop after he got out in 1969, and offered to pay him $25 every time he told the Bureau about a Klan meeting. Dawson shook hands on the deal. His time with the FBI ended the way most of his relationships didâunhappily. But Dawson resumed his double life a few weeks after Covingtonâs barbecue, when leaflets began appearing around Greensboro that announced a âDeath to the Klanâ march. The posters were the work of a group called the Workers Viewpoint Organization (WVO), which was filled with professionals who had elite-school degrees, identified as Maoists, and used revolutionary rhetoric to match. They had attempted to organize local textile workers, then tried direct action by taking part in the anti-KKK protest at China Grove. Now, they were itching for another, more visible confrontation with the Klan. A WVO flyer announces the November 3, 1979 'Death to the Klan' march and conference to be held in Greensboro. | Greensboro History Museum The leftists had plausible reasons for choosing to organize and demonstrate in North Carolina. At the end of the â70s, the state ranked 49th in the U.S. in blue-collar wages and dead last in the percentage of workers who were unionized. But neither Duke educations nor medical training nor Maoist ideology prepared them to comprehend the culture of electricians, loggers or sheet-metal workersâjobs held by some of the men who would ride the caravan into Greensboroâbeyond seeing them as either recruitable proletarians or irredeemable racists. The communists used language even more incendiary than the words on their flyers. On October 11, for instance, they issued a press release saying the KKK âmust be physically beaten back, eradicated, exterminated, wiped off the face of the earth.â And they took exactly the wrong message from China Grove: that the Klan would be too cowardly to mount any resistance to them. Instead, WVOâs leaflet lit a flame under Griffin and the Klan. It also alarmed the police in Greensboro. Soon, a detective who knew Dawsonâs FBI past was talking with him about disrupting local meetings of communists, which made perfect sense. After all, the KKK rated communists about the same as black people. But Dawson had another angle, too: He could help the police investigate the Klan. With a highly-developed sense of grievance that often left him feeling under-appreciated and under-used, he saw a chance to become the one who was pulling the stringsâboth as an informant and as an instigatorâas confrontations heated up. On Saturday, October 20, when Griffin marched his Invisible Empire through the fairgrounds in Lincoln County, about 100 miles southwest of Greensboro, and told a crowd of 150 that if they cared about their children, they would âkill a hundred niggers and leave them dead in the street.â At a members-only meeting afterward, he introduced Dawson to talk about the planned WVO march. Towering over the 5-foot-6 Griffin, Dawson started out by warning that the communists were recruiting busloads of black college students to flood into Greensboro. Asked whether it would be a good idea to bring guns, he demurred. âIâm not your father,â he replied. âBut if you carry a gun, you better have damned bond money.â The vote among those in the audience was unanimous: Theyâd go to Greensboro to make their presence felt. The following weekend, as word spread, white supremacist groups met in at least three different locations around North Carolina and agreed to head there, too. Dawson earned $50 by telling the Greensboro PD about the October 20 meeting. And he let them know Griffin was planning to come to town and looking for allies. But Dawson neglected to mention his own starring role, or the fact he subsequently drove around Morningside Homes in his Cadillac late at night, pasting leaflets over the âDeath to the Klan!â posters. His replacements featured a dark figure hanging from a noose and the phrase, âItâs time for some old-fashioned American Justice.â The Nazi camp, meanwhile, was getting just as frothy. At a November 1 event that Covington staged for the media in the garage of a sheet-metal worker named Roland Wayne Wood, a dozen of his recruits mugged through a made-for-TV roast of the disgraced China Grove wizard, Joe Grady. Once the cameras departed, the united racists got down to the business of how they planned to crash the communistsâ party in Greensboro. One suggested throwing eggs. Another went further, saying he had a pipe bomb that would be effective if thrown into a crowd. At 11:00 p.m., the group gathered around a television to watch themselves on the local news, only to become infuriated when a press conference held by the WVOâs members got more airtime. As the screen showed one of the march leaders calling the KKK âscum,â Jerry Paul Smith, the Klansman with the pipe bomb, took his gun and pointed it at the TV. Police reports would later quote Wood as saying that he heard Smith mutter, âKill the communist.â *** On the morning of November 3, Dawson called his Greensboro Police contact to say that three dozen supremacists from around the state, including Virgil Griffin, were assembling at a house owned by one of Dawsonâs Klan pals, a few miles from the Morningside Homes march site. A little later, Dawson called again to warn that the place was chock full of firearms. But that information never made its way to the shift commander, who wrapped up a daily briefing at about 10:30 that morning by reminding his men the parade permit listed a start time of noon. The officers could get breakfast, he said, so long as they were on the route by 11:30. A WVO member kneels beside a victim of the shooting. | Greensboro News and Record As the Klansmen and Nazis made their way along Interstate 85 into Greensboro, a Greensboro Police detective spotted the caravan and called in to ask if tactical units were in place. His supervisor, showing no special concern, replied that there was still âanother fourteen minutes by my watchâ for breakfast. The leftists planned to line up their crew at 11:00, then begin marching at noon. But at 11:22, a frightening transmission came over a CB radio: Klansmen were talking about closing in. Before the protesters could react, cars with Confederate-flag license plates began approaching. There were no cops in sight. Dawson, who was leading the convoy, would later tell police and reporters that he merely wanted to put a scare into the Maoists before driving on to the spot at the shopping center where the march would end. It was Dawson who yelled, âYou asked for the Klan. Now you got âem!â But then Griffinâs white LTD screeched and swerved, nearly hitting a marcher. The caravan came to a stop. The communists went from singing to swinging, banging their placards on the cars. Members of the convoy poured out, punching through the melee, grabbing weapons. Dawson told his driver to get the hell out of thereâand since they were in the first car of the caravan, they were able to split. The WVO had packed a few weapons, but were seriously outgunned. One of the WVO leaders, a physician named Jim Waller, lunged for a 12-gauge shotgun heâd stashed in a car, but a Klansman flew toward him before he could fire. The two rolled in the grass, fighting nose-to-nose over the weapon until others started piling on top of them and the pump mechanism snapped. Waller screamed as the pump-action crushed the bones in his shooting hand. WVO signs lay on the ground as a wounded person is taken away by medics. | Greensboro News and Record Amidst the chaos, other white supremacists lined up their shots. A Nazi named Jack Fowler opened the trunk of a blue Ford Fairlane and, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth, handed out rifles and shotguns. David Matthews, from Griffinâs Klan, stood behind the door of a van and nailed his first target, a bookish pediatrician named Mike Nathan. Then Matthews took down an organizer named Jim Wrenn, who was crawling on his belly. Bill Sampson, a former Harvard Divinity student, tried to give Wrenn rifle cover but took two fatal shots in the heart. Roland Wayne Wood observed Waller writhing from his crushed hand. Coolly aiming his shotgun, the Nazi delivered a blast into the physicianâs right side. Matthews, the Klan member, finished the job with another blast into Wallerâs back. The convoy sped away, with Matthewsâ van the last to leave the scene. Climbing aboard, Matthews let the rest of squad know: âI got three of âem.â Moments later, police intercepted the van, but didnât get to Morningside Homes until the shooting was over. *** Eighty-eight seconds of gunfire in Greensboro marked the worst violence in the South since the 1960s. And for the men who shot their enemies dead, November 3, 1979, was just the beginning of a new era of notoriety and collaboration. The botched trials and political response that followed ensured that white nationalism would grow to become more dangerous than ever today. The legal system took three whacks at the Greensboro conspirators. First, police rounded up 14 Klansmen and Nazis, and the state of North Carolina charged most of them with first-degree murder and felony riot. Prosecutors lined up eyewitnesses, videotapes, weapons and FBI ballistics analysis. But they couldnât convince the surviving revolutionariesâwho were stubbornly convinced the cops had conspired to leave them unprotectedâto cooperate. A group of the Klansmen and Nazis who faced murder charges for the Greensboro shooting, photographed before an arraignment hearing in 1979. | Greensboro News and Record At trial, the Klansmen and Nazis wrapped themselves in the American flag and argued self-defense. âThey acted like men to aid someone in distress,â Woodâs lawyer claimed. âThey would not have been worthy of anyoneâs respect if they had done otherwise.â He added that his client just wanted to sing, âMy country âtis of thee, sweet land of liberty, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.â On November 17, 1980, an all-white jury found the Klansmen and Nazis not guilty. âAnytime you defeat communism,â said Jerry Pridmore, one of the men acquitted, âitâs a victory for America.â The U.S. Justice Department then charged nine Klansmen and Nazis, this time including Griffin and Dawson, with conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the Greensboro victims. In April 1984, the federal jury, also all-white, refused to conclude the defendants had violated the law by acting out of racial rather than political hatred. It too delivered not-guilty verdicts across the board. The massacreÂ immediately raised questions about why GreensboroÂ police had not been present to prevent the violence. In this 1981 report, the Durham-based Institute forÂ Southern Studies demanded a federal investigation of the city â even as it voicedÂ skepticism of the Â U.S. Justice Department byÂ calling it âa fickle friend of politically unpopularÂ radicals.â | courtesy of authors Finally, the victims filed a $48-million lawsuit against 87 defendants, including the city of Greensboro, the state of North Carolina, the Justice Department and the FBI. Wood, now on trial for the third time, felt confident enough to give a Nazi salute when sworn to testify. In June 1985, the civil jury delivered a landmark yet twisted verdict: They found eight defendants liable for wrongful death: Dawson, five Klan and Nazi shooters, the Greensboro police detective who received advance word about the attack from Dawson and the lieutenant who was the GPD event commander at the massacre. But the jury applied that decision only in the case of Michael Nathan, the one murder victim who wasnât a WVO member at the time of the shootings. To avoid appeals, the city of Greensboro settled for $351,000, sending a check to Nathanâs widow, who split it among the survivors. Strike three. The supremacists who emerged from the Greensboro trials understood they were free. Free not just to stay out of prison, or to keep burning rags and kvetching about the price of jackboots. Free to work together to stockpile weapons, terrorize neighborhoods and commit violence up to and including murderâso long as their opponents were communists. Police records of the bullet spray and weapons carried during the massacre. | courtesy of authors âThe Klan and Nazis felt emboldened,â says Patricia Clark, a veteran Klan watcher who served on the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which local citizens set up in the mid-2000s to investigate the massacre. âThey thought they won the fight.â By 1980, membership in Klan-Nazi fusion groups began to outnumber that of old-school Klans. And as horizons of hate broadened and merged, alliances deepened around the country. As just one example, four months after Greensboro, the California Knights of the Ku Klux Klan rallied in the city of Oceanside and beat counter-protesters with baseball bats. The marchers brayed a version of âSixteen Tons,â the old coal-mining song. Their rewritten lyrics celebrated the Greensboro killings and ended, âIf the Nazis donât get you, a Klansman will.â The increasing unity of far-right factions was more than tactical. By transfusing âblood and soilâ into American racism, it led to what historian John Drabble called in a 2007 study âthe Nazification of the Ku Klux Klan.â That was bad news for hustlers like Eddie Dawson. Dawson managed to dodge Klan retribution for informing. But he soon found it much harder to profit from playing different extremists against one another. Greensboro turned Dawson into a relicâand the hardening ideology of right-wing terror networks that followed made them harder for the FBI to penetrate. Meanwhile, new doors swung wide open for fanatics like Frazier Glenn Miller, a Covington acolyte and former Green Beret who rode in the Greensboro caravan. Miller founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980. And by merging Klan and Nazi symbolism while instilling paramilitary discipline in his followers, he quickly built the strongest white-power group in the state.

The Greensboro veteran held public marches, harassed local black residents and amassed huge caches of explosives. In 1987, he issued a revolutionary âDeclaration of Warâ filled with calls for assassinations. He coordinated with The Order, a violent extremist group inspired by The Turner Diaries. And he sought allies through voluminous racist literature and eventually on the Internet, where he extolled the mass shooting by Anders Behring Breivik in Norway. Miller returned to racist murder in 2014, when he targeted a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas, and killed three people. That landed him on death row, where he sits today. Greensboroâs aftershocks held their most important lessons for mainstream opportunists. By the end of the 1970s, southern nationalists had spent more than a decade trying to re-code their racism to make it more palatable. As master political consultant Lee Atwater put it: âYou start out in 1954 by saying, âNigger, nigger, nigger.â By 1968, you canât say âniggerââthat hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, statesâ rights.â Republican politicians soon realized they could go even farther. After Greensboro, it became clear that, as historian Kathleen Belew has written, extremists âincreasingly used anticommunism as an alibi for racial violence.â And by targeting the far rightâs dual paranoiasâfederal authority and socialismâGOP operatives were able to harness its nativism while hanging onto the votes of establishment conservatives. Over the next 30 years, Republicans racked up spectacular gains in state legislative seats, governorships and U.S. Senate elections across the South by hammering cultural issues that the far right recognized as approving winks. A decade after Greensboro, establishment candidates were already posing in front of rebel flags and openly courting âwhite heritageâ groups like the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The GOP advanced most in counties where the Klan had been active in the â60s, according to a 2014 study by political scientists from Notre Dame, Brandeis and Yale. During the administration of President Barack Obama, the new generation of conservative politicians had the extremistsâ backs. In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report forecasting a rise in racist violence. Republicans objected so vociferously that DHS rescinded the projection and silenced its domestic terrorism unit. Mike Pompeo, then a congressman from Kansas, said it was âdangerousâ to track homegrown violence. By that point it was hard to tell who was co-opting whom on the right. Republicans were playing to the fringe without worrying where their most incitable elements might channel their anger. A cemetery marker in Greensboro. | Greensboro News and Record And you know what happened next: Jonah turned the whale inside out. Donald Trumpâs bald invocations of racial and working-class grievances made him a hero to the ultras; âMAGAâ is the most common word in Twitter user profiles among members of the alt-right, according to a study by J.M Berger of the research network VOX-Pol. From Charlottesville to Pittsburgh to El Paso, right-wing attacks have surged. The latest evidence: The FBI made almost 100 arrests related to domestic terrorism by July of this year, more than in all of 2018, according to agency director Christopher Wray, who told Congress the majority of cases involved âwhite supremacist violence.â In Greensboro, private citizens tried to find a way forward by empaneling a Truth & Reconciliation Commissionâthe first in U.S. history. But todayâs political landscape, where the language and resentments of white nationalism have taken deeper root than ever, raises the question: What happens when there is no reconciliation in truth? Twenty-six years after the massacre, Virgil Griffin surprised everyone at the Greensboro Commission by showing up and taking questions. Asked why no Klansman was killed in the shootings, he answered: âMaybe God guided the bullets.â California By Jeremy B.

386,https://www.breitbart.com/news/democrats-win-full-control-of-virginia-statehouse/,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Democrats continued their winning streak under President Trump on Tuesday and took full control of the statehouse for the first time in more than two decades. Democrats won majorities in both the state House and Senate in the marquee warmup for next year’s presidential election, the third election in a row in which they have made significant gains since Trump was elected. Of the four states with legislative elections this year, Virginia is the only one where control of the statehouse was up for grabs. Republicans had slim majorities in both the state House and Senate. National groups, particularly those aligned with Democrats, pumped huge amounts of money into the contests as a way to test-drive expensive messaging and get-out-the-vote campaigns ahead of the 2020 cycle. Gun control and clean energy groups affiliated with former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent several million dollars helping Democrats. Virginia also drew several high-profile visits from 2020 presidential hopefuls, including former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as current Vice President Mike Pence. Trump tried to rally Republicans via Twitter but stayed out of Virginia, a state he lost in 2016. His election three years ago has been disastrous for Virginia Republicans, particularly in growing suburban areas. Democrats have won every statewide contest, picked up three additional congressional seats and now are set to control both the state house and the Executive Mansion for the first time since 1994. Republicans were hoping an off-year election with no statewide candidates on the ballot would help defuse the anti-Trump energy that powered previous cycles. GOP lawmakers also were hopeful that the specter of a possible Trump impeachment would anger and motivate the Republican base. Democrats have pledged that when they take power, they will pass an agenda that Republicans have blocked for years, including stricter gun laws, a higher minimum wage and ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, making Virginia the final state needed for possible passage of the gender equality measure. Democrats were keenly focused on gun issues during the election, saying Republicans should be held accountable for failing to pass new restrictions after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach earlier this year. Republicans accused Democrats of trying to use the tragedy for political gain while focusing heavily on past Democratic efforts to loosen restrictions for third-trimester abortion. The GOP also warned of higher taxes and energy prices if they lose the majority. Tuesday’s election could help cement Democratic rule for the next decade, because the winners will decide who controls the next redistricting process. Lawmakers approved a proposed constitutional amendment this year that would create a new bipartisan commission empowered to draw legislative and congressional maps, but Democrats would have to sign off on it again next year before it could be presented to voters. .

387,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Gun-safety-groups-beat-the-NRA-on-its-home-turf-14814618.php,"Terry McAuliffe attends a September gun-control rally outside the headquarters of the National Rifle Association in Fairfax County with former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., center, and Del. Hala Ayala, D-Prince William, second from right, who is running for reelection. MUST CREDIT: The Washington Post by Jahi Chikwendiu GAINESVILLE, VA. — Mike and Tammie Howard can often hear gunshots from the woods near their house on the western edge of Washington D.C.’s sprawling suburbs. Mike Howard can even hear them from time to time at Kettle Run High School, where he coaches volleyball. So a political ad in Northern Virginia about the distance stray bullets travel before you can even hear the crack of the shot struck a chord with them. It’s the type of ad voters in Texas should expect to see soon as gun violence prevention groups gear up to spend big in the state next year after winning major victories in Virginia on Tuesday. “That hits home,” said Mike Howard, who used to coach teams in South Florida that played against Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed in 2018, including the athletics director who Howard knew personally. The ad, filled with images of empty playgrounds and bullets on football fields, was for John Bell, a Democrat who vowed in it, “I’m not afraid of the NRA, especially when it comes to keeping our kids safe.” Bell this week flipped a state Senate district just a few miles from the National Rifle Association’s national headquarters by campaigning hard on gun violence prevention. His ad was one of several funded by gun safety groups, who spent nearly $3 million taking on the NRA on its home turf. Texas Take: Get political headlines from across the state sent directly to your inbox Guns emerged as a top issue for voters in Virginia, a state still reeling from a mass shooting earlier this year — especially for voters in the suburbs like those around D.C. and Richmond, who helped Democrats claim control of the state legislature for the first time in 26 years. “We sent a message to the NRA in their own backyard,” said former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who launched a gun violence prevention group after she was shot at a rally in Tucson in 2011. “We are turning the page on an era where legislators cashed gun lobby checks while communities lived in fear of shootings.” Next on Giffords’ list is Texas, where the group has had recent success helping Democrats. The group spent more than $1 million on TV ads in Houston in 2018, supporting U.S. Rep. Lizzie Fletcher, a Democrat who unseated longtime Republican Congressman John Culberson. The ads went after Culberson for taking money from the NRA and voting for weaker gun laws. Groups like Giffords have “targets up and down the ballot in Texas in 2020,” said Peter Ambler, the group’s executive director. They include everything from the U.S. Senate race to congressional seats and state House districts — especially in the suburbs. “Texas is going to be a big priority of ours,” Ambler said. Virginia is often seen as a bellwether in national politics, but it has some key similarities to Texas. Both states have gun-friendly cultures challenged by rapidly expanding suburbs, where voters are more likely to support gun control measures. For subscribers: Beto O’Rourke exposed a blue spine across deep red Texas Both states have also been racked by gun violence. A gunman killed 12 people at a Virginia Beach municipal building in May. Texas, meanwhile, is still reeling from mass shootings in El Paso and Midland-Odessa in August that left 29 people dead. Polling also establishes that voters in both states are more open to new gun laws than the Republicans running the state house. Guns were the top issue for Virginians just a month ahead of this week’s elections, with overwhelming majorities favoring expanding background checks and “red flag” laws allowing authorities to take weapons away from someone deemed a danger, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll. There’s some evidence voters in Texas feel the same. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll this month found the majority of Texas voters support stricter gun laws, and the vast majority — including most Republicans — favor requiring background checks for all gun purchases. A Quinnipiac University poll last month found 89 percent of Texas voters support background checks for all gun buyers. “Advocates in Virginia have pushed this issue to the forefront,” said Don Mark, a Democratic consultant in Richmond. “It’s a huge shift in this politics, and it’s really driven by suburban voters.” Bell’s was one of two suburban districts Democrats picked up campaigning on gun safety. The party picked up at least five new state House seats, as well, and now controls the entire state government for the first time in a generation. Many of the races were heavily funded by gun violence prevention groups. Giffords spent at least $300,000 on digital ads in the state. Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund, a group funded by New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, spent $2.5 million in the state, including funding Bell’s ad. The NRA in a statement said the result is that ""Virginians are about to experience life under a distant tycoon’s thumb.” “Candidates who proudly accepted Bloomberg’s cash — and every voter they misled — will soon realize the cost of being beholden to a Manhattan billionaire who despises Virginians’ right to self-defense,” the group said. “Fortunately, many NRA-backed candidates in Virginia, New Jersey, Kentucky and Mississippi prevailed over their Bloomberg-funded opponents. As the battle continues, so does the NRA’s defense of the Second Amendment rights of all Americans."" ‘If we can’t change the laws, we’re going to change your seats’ The effort by gun safety advocates followed a special session Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, called after the Virginia Beach shooting. Republicans, who controlled the Legislature, adjourned after just 90 minutes without considering a single bill. “People are tired and fed up that those in control — and at this point in time, Republicans — are doing nothing about this,” said Lori Haas, the state director of Stop Gun Violence, who has lobbied the state legislature on the issue ever since her daughter was shot at Virginia Tech in 2007. “Virginia Tech happened 12 years ago and people thought there would be something … Of course the voters are fed up and demanding change. If we can’t change the laws, we’re going to change your seats.” Some Republicans in the state apparently heard that message. State Sen. Glen Sturtevant, who was unseated by Ghazala Hashmi in a suburb of Richmond, sent out campaign mailers in the weeks ahead of the election claiming support for “red flag” laws. It’s a shift that has started to happen in Texas, as well. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in the wake of the El Paso shooting started calling for expanding background checks — even going as far as to call out the NRA for opposing them. State Rep. Sarah Davis, a Houston Republican, has also voiced support for background checks, as have the Republican mayors of Odessa, Midland, El Paso and Fort Worth. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, meanwhile, is pushing federal legislation that would crack down on people selling guns illegally and expand mental health programs — but notably leaves out measures such as red flag laws and tightening background checks for gun purchases. Cornyn will likely be a top target for gun violence prevention groups, who say his legislation would do little to stop mass shootings. Cornyn’s opponents, meanwhile, have hit him for taking money from the gun lobby, including a $1,000 campaign donation from the NRA’s political action committee two weeks after a gunman killed 22 at an El Paso Walmart. “Even though you have John Cornyn, who is putting forward a fig leaf piece of legislation, he is acknowledging by doing that, that he’s in trouble, that he has to have an answer on guns, that his decades-long embrace of the NRA has made him less safe,” Ambler said. Cornyn has said his proposal “would go a long way toward making sure the background check requirement is more comprehensive” by going after people who go around existing requirements. He has said his is a proposal that can actually make it through Congress and earn the president’s signature. “For those who say we want you to do more — I’m happy to listen, but I’m also interested to know how we can actually achieve the objective, because people have come up with a lot of good ideas, but if you can’t get the votes to pass it in the House and Senate and get a presidential signature, they don’t count for much,” he said earlier this month. Moms Demand Action, another group advocating for stricter gun laws, has already vowed that its volunteers will be out in full force in Texas next year supporting candidates — including three former Moms Demand Action volunteers who are running for seats in the state House: Becca De Felice in San Antonio and Jennifer Skidonenko and Paige Dixon in North Texas. Giffords says its success helping Fletcher flip her Houston seat is evidence of what the group can do outside of Virginia. “Even that was a sign of the times,” Ambler said. “The idea that a gun safety organization would, in the state of Texas, be able to go into the Houston media market and run negative ads against a Republican incumbent based on his connections to the NRA would have been thought impossible just a few years ago. The changing nature of Texas’ big, big suburbs and cities is really driving these shifts.” ben.wermund@chron.com Benjamin Wermund is the Houston Chronicle's Washington correspondent.

By GARY FINEOUT, MATT DIXON and ISABEL DOBRIN 11/05/2019 07:00 AM EST Good Tuesday morning. Welcome to the latest episode of “As the Tallahassee Swamp Turns.” What happened? — On this episode, Ryan West, the longtime chief of staff to Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, started an LLC with state regulator-turned-contract-lobbyist Jeff Woodburn. The two wanted to try and snag liquor licenses through a state lottery. Both said they are simply old friends who wanted to go into business together, and there is nothing illegal about the arrangement. That should be made clear. But, let’s state the situation another way: the top staffer for Florida’s highest financial regulator went into business (in September) with a lobbyist whose firm has business before his office. Never mind — After we asked about the arrangement on Friday, West came out and said — though the business venture was vetted “both legally and ethically” — he would be stepping away in order not to be a distraction. You know what was not part of the process? Telling his boss. When asked for comment, Patronis said he didn’t know about his top staffer’s side business, and West would be leaving his office by the end of the year. Patronis made it sound like West’s exit was already in the works, but it had not been disclosed publicly. ON SECOND THOUGHT — “Top Patronis aide quits business partnership with lobbyist,” by POLITICO’s Matt Dixon: A top state official said he will abandon a business he launched with a prominent lobbyist after POLITICO raised questions about the arrangement. Ryan West, chief of staff to state CFO Jimmy Patronis, said Monday that he is in the process of pulling out of a partnership with Jeff Woodburn, a former state regulator now working at The Advocacy Group at Cardenas Partners. In response to questions about the enterprise, Patronis said West would be leaving the Department of Financial Services at the end of the year.

Scott Plakon hid real estate holdings, ethics complaint alleges,” by Orlando Sentinel’s Gray Rohrer: “Rep. Scott Plakon was hit with an ethics complaint from a Washington D.C.-based watchdog group on Monday, alleging he didn’t disclose extensive real estate holdings on his financial disclosure forms for several years and directed campaign funds to companies he owned.” SURPRISE — “Gun rights groups, Moody target assault weapons ban,” by News Service of Florida’s Dara Kam: “The National Rifle Association condemned a proposed constitutional amendment that aims to do away with assault weapons in Florida as a “classic example of impermissible political rhetoric” designed to inflame voters’ emotions.” WHAT’S IN YOUR WALLET? — “Florida utility regulators prepare to raise energy bills, reduce conservation measures,” by Miami Herald’s Mary Ellen Klas and Samantha J. Gross: “The Florida Public Service Commission will be tested Tuesday as it is asked to take two votes that could have a significant impact on customer electricity bills in the future: one to set rules for charging customers billions to bury power lines and another to wipe out energy conservation incentives that utilities say are unneeded.” MOVING QUICKLY — “Senate fast tracking bill to block local sunscreen rules,” by POLITICO’s Matt Dixon: “A Senate panel on Monday approved legislation aimed at prohibiting local governments from banning certain types of sunscreens, moving quickly to advance a measure that failed to win enough support to pass in the last legislative session.” LOOK IT UP — “Hospital price website targets ‘opaque’ system,” by News Service of Florida’s Christine Sexton: “After three years in the making, the state on Monday launched a website meant to help consumers shop and compare the prices of hospital services --- but it already is coming under fire from a group that represents hospitals across Florida.” — “DOE delays response to ballooning lawsuit over teacher bonuses,” by POLITICO’s Andrew Atterbury — “While Florida schools set medical marijuana rules, senator files bill to protect students,” by Tallahassee Democrat’s James Call — WHERE'S RON? — Gov. DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis are scheduled to make a “major announcement” during stops in Stuart and Fort Myers Beach. NEW STRATEGY — “Giuliani associate Parnas offers to comply with subpoena,” by POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: An indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani is offering to participate in Congress’s ongoing impeachment inquiry, although major legal hurdles remain before lawmakers’ seem likely to be able to tap the potential new source of information on President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-born U.S. citizen currently under house arrest in Florida on campaign finance charges, is offering an olive branch to Congress after previously rebuffing a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee last month.

'Going back to when I ran for president, one of the moments that people remember is when I talked about how we need more welders and less philosophers,' the senior senator from Florida said in an interview.

Rick Scott, was asked by The Daily Beast if his home state was out of the Democrats' grasp if one of the leading progressive candidates became the standard-bearer for Democrats. 'The answer is yes,' Nelson told The Daily Beast.” HERE WE GO — “Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony officially files to run for election,” by Sun Sentinel's Skyler Swisher: “Broward Sheriff Gregory Tony on Monday officially launched his campaign for next year’s high-stakes election, setting up a showdown with his predecessor who was ousted from the post after the Parkland school shooting.” ‘YOU HAVE TO BE AT THEIR EVENTS’ — ""Republicans tout Trump in push for Florida’s Hispanic vote,"" by Tampa Bay Times' Kavitha Surana: ""The rhythms of salsa music pulsed through Al Lopez Park during the annual Conga Caliente festival on Sunday afternoon. Families brought fold-out chairs and enjoyed snacks from the kiosks selling skewers of meat, arepas and plantains filled with cheese, while Latina stars like Albita performed on stage. Amid the student dance groups and vendors hawking sugar-sweet raspados, there was a life-size cutout of President Donald Trump. Some people shook their heads or muttered insults as they passed by while carrying plates of orange fried bacalao, but others stopped to take a picture or high-five the 'Latinos for Trump' volunteers hovering nearby."" STAYING OUT — Republican state Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto, one of the most powerful women in the Florida Legislature, said Monday she won't join the race to replace outgoing Rep. Francis Rooney. Rooney last month announced he would not run for re-election, sparking interest from a long line of GOP elected officials from southwest Florida. Benacquisto, who is leaving the Senate next year due to term limits, announced her decision on Twitter. ""After thoughtful consideration I have decided that running for Congress in 2020 is not the right path for me and my family at this time. I am extremely grateful for the words of encouragement and support from so many friends and neighbors as I have considered this option,"" she wrote.

People living there had tried to save it, pleading with the Tampa Housing Authority and filing lawsuits. But their efforts failed and Robles Pond, a humble community of about 45 acres linked by sandy roads, was replaced with Robles Park Village — a new public housing complex of 67 buildings for whites only.” REGRETS — “‘Queen of Versailles’ Jackie Siegel: ‘We’re sorry we ever started’ house,” by Orlando Sentinel's Hal Boedeker: “At a Las Vegas gala last week for the Victoria Siegel Foundation, Jackie and David Siegel opened up about their lavish home under construction in Windermere. The charity event was to fight the opioid epidemic; 18-year-old Victoria Siegel died of an overdose in 2015.” LITERARY CRITICS — “Commissioners call New York Times ‘fake news,’ deny library funding for digital subscriptions,” by Tampa Bay Times’ Josh Fiallo: “The Citrus County Commission came to a consensus at the end of October: The county should not spend roughly $2,700 annually to buy digital subscriptions to the New York Times for the 70,000 library-card holders who reside in the county. The commissioners were not shy in sharing why they thought it was a waste of money, according to the Citrus County Chronicle. ‘Do we really need to subscribe to the New York Times?’ one commissioner asked. ‘Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?” asked another.’” LOOKING FOR SIGNS — “Who will be Cuba’s prime minister? A general and former Castro son-in-law stands out,” by Miami Herald's Nora Gámez Torres: “Whether in New York, Mexico, or Russia, a face has become familiar in the most recent international trips Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel has made: that of General Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Calleja.” ‘MY AR STOPPED IT’ — “Florida woman, 8 months pregnant, used AR-15 to shoot, kill home intruder,” by Orlando Sentinel's Tiffini Theisen: “The woman who fatally shot a home intruder in suburban Tampa last week was pregnant and used an AR-15 to kill the man, according to a news report.” CRUEL — “Florida man pleads guilty after using power saw to remove saw-shaped nose off sawfish,” by Sun Sentinel's Joe Mario Pedersen: “A Florida man pleaded guilty Friday to killing an endangered sawfish off of Florida’s coast last summer, according the U.S. Attorney’s Office.” — ""Banner year for sea turtle nesting in Southwest Florida,"" by Herald-Tribune's Carlos R.

392,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Beto-O-Rourke-drops-out-of-presidential-race-14803167.php,"Beto O'Rourke, former Representative from Texas, speaks on the sidelines of the Iowa Democratic Party Liberty & Justice Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 1, 2019. The former Texas congressman said in a blog post earlier in the day that he was ending his bid for the White House amid lackluster fundraising and poor poll numbers. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Julián Castro answers questions from reporters after speaking to a crowd at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on Aug. 9, 2019. MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Salwan Georges Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke is among those seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. That’s a break for Sen. John Cornyn, a reader says. For one reader, Beto O’Rourke’s road trip, chronicled on social media, brings to mind another politician seeking to clear his mind. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign for the White House is over. “Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,” O’Rourke said Friday on social media. “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. Acknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.” It’s also the end of a long fall for a campaign that started in March with great promise. In the first 24 hours, O’Rourke raised a shocking $6.1 million and was polling over 10 percentage points nationally — putting him among the top three or four contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. But O’Rourke’s fortunes changed dramatically after former Vice President Joe Biden jumped into the campaign in late April. Starting in May, O’Rourke’s position in the polls declined sharply. Over the past month, O’Rourke has struggled to hit even 1 percent in many national polls, which had him on the brink of failing to qualify for the debate stage on Nov. 20 when the candidates will square off in Atlanta. In order to make the cut, candidates have to make 3 percent in at least four national polls. O’Rourke hit that mark in just two. O’Rourke, a former Democratic congressman from El Paso who came within 3 percentage points of defeating U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, did not say whether he will endorse one of the other candidates for president. However, he did promise to stay involved in his party’s campaign against President Donald Trump. For subscribers: Democrat Beto O’Rourke exposed a blue spine across deep red Texas “We will work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020,” said O’Rourke, 47. “I can tell you firsthand from having the chance to know the candidates, we will be well served by any one of them, and I’m going to be proud to support whoever that nominee is.” Our campaign has always been about seeing clearly, speaking honestly, and acting decisively. In that spirit: I am announcing that my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee. https://t.co/8jrBPGuX4t It didn’t take long for Trump to tweet about O’Rourke dropping out: “Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was ‘born for this.’ I don’t think so!” Trump was referring to a Vanity Fair article published just before O’Rourke announced his candidacy, in which he was quoted saying “I'm just born to be in it.” Oh no, Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was “born for this.” I don’t think so! O’Rourke built his political career on beating incumbents and long odds. First in 2005, O'Rourke defeated an incumbent city councilman in El Paso. Then in 2012, O'Rourke challenged incumbent Congressman Silvestre Reyes in a Democratic primary in El Paso. O'Rourke won and served three terms before taking on Cruz in 2018. O’Rourke did not say what his next step in politics will be. He has previously said he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate again in 2020. Texas Democrats were quick to praise O’Rourke for his aggressive campaigning in 2018 that helped make Democrats pick up seats in Congress and the state Legislature — momentum they hope to carry into 2020. He came closer to winning a statewide race than any Democrat in 25 years. “Beto O’Rourke has done amazing things for the Democratic Party in Texas, and we look forward to his future,” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said. Praised for ‘commitment to end gun violence’ Other candidates running for the White House also lauded O’Rourke. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., thanked him for his advocacy on gun violence, particularly after the August mass shooting in El Paso in which 22 people were killed. “Your commitment to ending gun violence and uplifting the voices of the victims and their families has made this presidential race — and our country — stronger,” Warren wrote on Twitter. Biden, too, pointed to the issue of guns as an area that O’Rourke made an impact. “His passion for solving our gun crisis has been inspiring to anyone who has seen him.” Biden said. The Rise of Beto O'Rourke Congressional upset: O'Rourke, a former punk rock guitarist, overcomes long odds to defeat U.S. Rep. Silverstre Reyes in a Democratic Primary in 2012 and eventually becomes a member of Congress representing El Paso for 6 years. Statewide shocker: O'Rourke, relying on an unrelenting travel schedule and constant livestreaming, comes within 3 percentage points of defeating U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, the best showing for any statewide Democrat in Texas in 25 years. Presidential contender: After declaring he would not run for president, O'Rourke meets with former President Barack Obama in November and then by December is hinting he will run after all. On March 14, after a string of national television talk show appearances, O'Rourke declares he running for president. Early surge: O'Rourke pulls in over $9 million in donations during his first two weeks, hitting over 10 percent in early polls. Enter Biden: Almost from the moment former Vice President Joe Biden announced he was running in late April, O'Rourke's fortunes go South. By mid-summer O'Rourke was polling in the low single digits and his fundraising slowed dramatically. Debate drama: As in his U.S. Senate campaign, O'Rourke struggled to translate his energy onto a debate stage in June. In the first debate with other contenders, O'Rourke appeared flat-footed as lesser-known candidates attacked him. His debate performances got better, but not enough to give him a true moment to launch him back into the upper tier of the race. Gun issues: After the August mass shooting in El Paso that left 22 people dead, O'Rourke became an even more ardent supporter of gun control measures. His previous calls for a voluntary gun buy back program got more aggressive with him turning it into a mandatory program that would require all people with assault-style firearms to sell them back to the government: ""Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" he said in a September debate. October slide: While he qualified for all the earlier debates, O'Rourke's polling numbers made it unlikely for him to qualify for either of the next two presidential debates. On Friday he announces the end of his presidential campaign on social media and before supporters in Iowa. Texas Take: Get political headlines from across the state sent directly to your inbox Since the summer, O’Rourke has been criticized for venturing further and further left politically. Most notably, O’Rourke called for a mandatory buy back program for assault-style weapons such as AR-15s and AK-47s. O’Rourke had originally called for banning future sales of those types of guns. But after the El Paso shooting, O’Rourke called for taking the weapons off the street — even from people who already legally purchased them. “Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,"" O’Rourke said during the presidential debate in September at Texas Southern University in Houston. O’Rourke on Friday was far from offering regrets for his positions on guns or other issues. Instead, he said he was proud of the bold policy positions he rolled out. “We released the first comprehensive plan to confront climate change of any of the presidential candidates,” O’Rourke said. “We took the boldest approach to gun safety in American history; we confronted institutional, systemic racism and called out Donald Trump for his white supremacy and the violence that he’s encouraged against communities that don’t look like, pray like or love like the majority in this country; and we were one of the first to reject all PAC money, corporate contributions, special interest donations and lobbyist help.” O’Rourke’s decision to drop out of the race came on the same day he was supposed to launch a more aggressive push in Iowa. On Friday night he was expected to be among the presidential contenders to speak in Des Moines as he kicked of a five-day run through the state that will begin voting in the Iowa Caucuses on Feb. 3. “Though this is the end of this campaign, we are right in the middle of this fight,” O’Rourke told supporters in a rally in Des Moines moments after he announced he was quitting the race.“I entered this campaign because I believed that we had the ability to bring together a very divided and highly polarized country in the face of the greatest challenges that we have ever known.” When he started the campaign, O’Rourke made his background as the only candidate from a border city with Mexico and his opposition to Trump’s wall central to his campaign. Frequently he talked about how El Paso, Texas, is “one of the safest cities in America — safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.” Nate Lerner, a co-founder of a Brooklyn-based group Draft Beto that formed to lure O’Rourke into the presidential contest said Friday he wasn’t surprised by the news. O’Rourke’s campaign had been sending out “pretty clear” signals it was in trouble through frantic fundraising emails. ‘He’s damaged,’ GOP strategist says O’Rourke’s run frustrated Lerner and others who coaxed him into the race. Lerner said they’d seen him as an “inspiring figure” who knew how to work with new media, with the potential for a viral moment at any time — as he proved during his Senate campaign. “It just never happened,” Lerner said. “He fell short on the presidential stage.” Lerner predicted that O’Rourke is done in Texas, saying he fears some of O’Rourke’s most extreme positions — the mandatory gun buybacks and calls to end tax-exempt status for churches that don’t accept gay marriage - would come back to haunt him. Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist who ran Sen. John Cornyn’s 2014 campaign, agreed. “He’s damaged,” Steinhauser said. “The Democrats are going to make the case we need someone new, we need new blood … the Republicans will be saying, ‘You lost two big races in a row and on the second one you didn’t even get any traction at all — why should we take you seriously at all? Why should we fear you as a candidate?’” Steinhauser said he was surprised O’Rourke didn’t stay in the race longer. He figured O’Rourke was hoping to get a vice presidential nomination. He said there was a time in 2008 when it seemed like John McCain was “left for dead” and he wound up with the nomination. “My general view of these things is hang in there, stick it out,” he said. “He just never had the juice, so maybe it was kind of a bubble. It just burst.” O’Rourke made clear in his announcement on Friday that he doesn’t plan to fade out of politics completely. “I’m confident I will see you down the road, and I look forward to that day,” O’Rourke told supporters.

Mike Lang, a Republican from Granbury, said in a letter to Nevárez. “Chairman Poncho Nevárez, you [have] broken the authority and trust that has been given to you.” Nevárez, an Eagle Pass Democrat who was among the first to support Republican House Speaker Dennis Bonnen in his selection as leader of the chamber, was tasked with leading the House Homeland Security and Public Safety committee this session. After a mass shooting in El Paso that left 22 people dead in August, he was chosen as vice chair of the House Committee on Mass Violence Prevention and Community Safety. Three other Republican lawmakers — Plano’s Jeff Leach, Hillister’s James White and Weatherford’s Phil King, who is a former police officer — called earlier this month for Nevárez to be removed from those committees. A major concern among those lawmakers was the appearance of a conflict of interest, White said. As leader of the Homeland Security and Public Safety committee, Nevárez oversees law enforcement in the state, including the Department of Public Safety, which is leading the investigation into his felony drug possession arrest. Lang, another former police officer who sits on both committees, said Nevárez had taken the first step in admitting to what he had done but “there are consequences for actions.” In a tweet, Lang also expressed concerns about border security, which falls under the purview of the Homeland Security and Public Safety committee. On the day Nevárez was caught on video dropping an envelope with bags of cocaine in September, he had just arrived at the Austin airport in a private plane from his district on the Texas-Mexico border. “It is important that Rep. Nevárez step down as Chairman because trust is an important aspect of our service for Texas,” Lang said in a tweet. “In addition, border security concerns are too great for him to continue his service as chairman.” Nevárez publicly admitted to possessing cocaine and said his recently announced retirement from the House was spurred by an addiction. He turned himself in to authorities earlier this month and is out on bond. He is set to continue in office until a new representative is elected from his district next year. He did not respond to a request for comment. James Barragán. James Barragán covers Texas politics for The Dallas Morning News.

Forty-nine people were killed and dozens more were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub in June 2016. It was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history until a gunman opened fire on Las Vegas concertgoers in 2017. The design concepts are only a starting point for discussions on the Pulse memorial and museum and are open to revisions, according to organizers. The designs were produced by several French architects and artists who worked with an Orlando architectural firm and a DePaul University professor. Plans call for the memorial to feature a garden with 49 trees in honor of the victims who were killed. The museum will have open-air areas, a vertical garden, public plazas and a rooftop promenade, according to the design concepts. A committee of Pulse survivors, architects and central Florida leaders picked the concepts following a public viewing of six finalists' proposals. Members of the public left 2,300 comments about the six finalists, which had been whittled down from 68 submissions. The memorial will be at the site of the former nightclub and the museum will be a third of a mile away.

399,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/armed-man-walmart-pleads-guilty-reduced-charge-66689563,"A man who caused a panic at a Missouri Walmart when he walked inside wearing body armor and carrying loaded weapons in what he described as an effort to test his Second Amendment rights has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- A man who caused panic at a Missouri Walmart when he walked inside wearing body armor and carrying loaded weapons in what he described as an effort to test his right to bear arms pleaded guilty to making a false report Friday after initially being charged with a more serious terrorist-related felony. Dmitriy Andreychenko, 21, pleaded guilty to an amended misdemeanor charge after originally being         charged with making a terrorist threat. Police arrested Andreychenko on Aug. 8 after he filmed himself walking through the store with the weapons, prompting shoppers and employees to leave. The incident came just days after         22 people were killed during an attack at another Walmart in El Paso, Texas. An off-duty firefighter held Andreychenko at gunpoint until officers arrived. Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson said in a news release Friday that Andreychenko didn't intend to carry out a shooting but was conducting what he called a ""social experiment"" in the wake of the Texas shooting and another mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio. The release said Andreychenko had researched both shootings and saved the alleged manifesto of the El Paso shooter on his phone. On the day before the shooting, he posted a picture to Snapchat of a family member wearing his body armor looking down the sights of a rifle with the caption, ""Watch out Walmart."" Under the terms of the plea, he was ordered to serve 48 hours of shock incarceration and two years of probation. He also must receive firearm training, Patterson said the release. The making a terrorist threat carried a sentence of up to four years in prison. Andreychenko's attorney, Dee Wampler, said in a statement released Friday in advance of the plea that Andreychenko is a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. ""His intention was to make a statement of his right to openly carry a firearm, which was legal but — for which he now admits was ill-timed given a recent Texas Walmart shooting,"" the statement said. ""It was a very bad idea which he now regrets. Regardless of how it looked, he never intended to harm or frighten anyone and merely saw it as a way to exercise his rights."" During an interview with KYTV in August, Andreychenko said the act was ""foolish"" and ""innocent,"" but he did not regret his actions. Andreychenko started to record himself with his phone while he was still in the car parked at Walmart. He got the body armor from the trunk of his car and put it on before grabbing a shopping cart and walking into the store, according to the probable cause statement. Andreychenko said his intention was to buy grocery bags. The rifle had a loaded magazine inserted, but a round was not chambered. A handgun on his right hip was loaded with one round in the chamber. ""I wanted to know if Walmart honored the Second Amendment,"" the probable cause statement quoted Andreychenko as saying. His wife, Angelice Andreychenko, told investigators that she warned him it was not a good idea, adding that he was an immature boy. His attorney added in Friday's statement that he should have listened to his wife's advice. The probable cause statement does not allege that he pointed the weapons at anyone, although patrons in the surveillance video could be seen in the background running away. Walmart said in a statement following the incident that it allows concealed and open carry in stores if it is legal in the jurisdictions where the stores are located. It         later said it was requesting that customers refrain from openly carrying firearms at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores unless they are law enforcement officers. However, it said that it won't be changing its policy for customers who have permits for concealed carry. Walmart says it will be adding signage in stores to inform customers of those changes. Since January 2017, Missouri has not required a permit to openly or conceal carry a firearm for those 19 years or older. Roughly 30 states allow the open carrying of handguns and rifles and shotguns in public without a permit.

400,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/parkland-commission-urges-boost-mental-health-funding-66691144,"A commission investigating the Parkland school shooting is pushing Florida lawmakers to boost funding for mental health services TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A commission investigating the Parkland school shooting is calling for improved mental health services, including more funding, to help schoolchildren deal with the stresses in their lives — a strategy the commission hopes will help prevent more violence from erupting at other Florida campuses. The commission released its second report to lawmakers Friday, 10 months after an initial report urged immediate improvements to school safety following killings of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last year. Lawmakers responded to the commission's first set of recommendations by enacting a package of school-safety measures, including raising the legal age for gun purchases, requiring armed security officers on every campus and adopting a ""red flag"" law. ""The needle has moved. We're in a better place than we were 20 months ago,"" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who chairs the commission, said in an interview. ""But we're still not in the place where we want to be in many places in Florida, and there's more work to be done."" The 389-page document released Friday by the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission advocates new laws that would allow authorities to act more quickly against threats of violence, including making it a felony to verbally threaten a mass shooting. While the commission's first report, released in January, focused on the suspect, Nikolas Cruz, and some of the specifics that led to the massacre, this one provides a broader analysis of systemic issues that the commission wants addressed. Key among them, according to the commission, is mental health. Among its findings: Florida's mental health system is inadequately funded. The commission, noting Florida's rank among the lowest of any state in per-capita mental health funding, recommended that the Legislature authorize more spending on mental health programs. The commission, however, did not suggest a specific amount and instead recommended an assessment of how mental health resources are being deployed. Gualtieri said the mishmash of mental health services, limited as they currently are, may sometimes prevent children with behavioral problems from getting the help they need. The commission wants better coordination of services, including better information sharing, to help identify trouble before exploding into harmful situations. The commission also wants to empower judges to intervene whenever they identify a child who might benefit from mental health treatment. In his message prefacing the report, Gualtieri said complacency and noncompliance — even resistance to the new laws — undermine the work being done to make schools safer. ""Complacency is driven, at least in part, by the erroneous notion that a school shooting will not 'happen here',"" he wrote. ""Everyone needs to proceed with a sense of urgency to make Florida's schools as safe as possible because there will be another K-12 active assailant attack in this country,"" Gualtieri said. ""The only questions are when and where."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-11-01 12:33:41, Parkland commission urges boost in mental health funding,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Douglas Haig, 57, was not accused of a direct role in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 at an open-air music festival. Prosecutors never alleged that he had advance knowledge of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. “Doug had no indication whatsoever about Stephen Paddock’s plans,” defense attorney Marc Victor said, invoking the name of the shooter during a prepared statement outside U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Haig declined to comment. “Doug was absolutely devastated when he learned of the tragedy” and that he previously sold ammunition to Paddock, Victor said. Haig acknowledged before U.S. District Judge James Mahan that he had no license to disassemble, remanufacture and reload bullets at his home workshop in Mesa, Arizona. He used the business name Specialized Military Ammunition during sales on the internet and at gun shows around the country. Haig closed the business permanently following an FBI raid less than three weeks after the shooting, Victor said. As a convicted felon, Haig now cannot possess weapons or ammunition. The plea avoided a trial that had been scheduled to begin next month. If convicted, Haig could have faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His plea agreement could get him about two years at sentencing Feb. 19. Victor said he’ll seek probation. Victor argued that as the only person to face a criminal charge following the shooting, Haig could not be fairly judged by a jury drawn from the trauma-scarred Las Vegas community. Victor lost bids to get the judge to dismiss the case; move the trial to Phoenix or Reno; draw jurors from throughout Nevada; and for the judge to hear the case from the bench himself instead of convening a jury. Haig, an aerospace engineer, acknowledged publicly in 2018 that he sold 720 rounds of tracer ammunition to Paddock in the weeks before the massacre. Tracers illuminate the path of fired bullets. Haig said he hadn’t noticed anything suspicious about Paddock during the exchange at his home. A criminal complaint filed in Phoenix said Haig told investigators that Paddock went to his car to get gloves and put them on before accepting the purchase. Authorities said Haig’s fingerprints were found on unfired bullets in the high-rise hotel suite from which Paddock spent more than 10 minutes firing more than 1,000 rounds into the open-air concert crowd before killing himself. Ammunition in the room also bore tool marks consistent with Haig's reloading equipment, prosecutors said, and Haig’s address was on a box that police found near Paddock’s body. Authorities have not said if ammunition made by Haig was used in the shooting. Police and the FBI determined that Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant and high-stakes video poker player, meticulously planned the attack and acted alone. Police reported finding 23 assault-style weapons and a handgun in the suite, including 14 equipped with bump stocks that allow for rapid firing like an automatic rifle. Investigators theorized that Paddock may have sought notoriety but said they never determined a clear motive. Prosecutor Patrick Burns filed documents to let the government keep thousands of bullets and casings seized from Haig’s home, and hundreds of pounds of ammunition components. Haig’s plea came four days after the death of a Southern California woman who was paralyzed by a spinal wound while fleeing with 22,000 other attendees of the Route 91 Harvest Festival. The San Bernardino County sheriff’’s office said Kimberly Gervais, 57, of Mira Loma died at a nursing facility in Redlands.

412,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/probe-offers-clear-answers-virginia-mass-shooting-66994208,"An independent probe into Virginia Beach’s mass shooting fails to offer clear answers for exactly why a city engineer opened fire in his workplace VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- A months-long independent probe into the Virginia Beach mass shooting has concluded, but it offers no clear answers as to why a city engineer killed 12 people in his workplace, according to findings released Wednesday. The investigation, conducted by Chicago-based security company Hillard Heintze, found no warning signs by the shooter that could have helped the city prevent the May 31 tragedy. The firm also said that the longtime city employee did not work in a systemically toxic workplace, which some people in this coastal city of nearly 500,000 had proposed as a possible factor. What the investigation did reveal was a man who experienced the kind of pressures and life challenges that many people do. DeWayne Craddock, 40, had gone through a divorce and was having trouble at work. He wrote emails on his work computer that went unsent but claimed he was unjustly disciplined. But independent investigators were at a loss to explain how such “stressors” could have translated into violence. “The information is just not there,” the independent security firm’s CEO, Arnette Heintze, told reporters after presenting a 262-page report to Virginia Beach’s City Council. “What we can tell you is that in 2016 his life started changing,” Heintze said. “We can tell you that he started acquiring firearms … body armor and silencers. He starts visiting (newspaper websites that are reporting) on mass shootings.” Craddock had worked in the city’s public utilities department. He used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to kill 11 of his co-workers and a contractor who had stopped at the city’s sprawling municipal complex to get a permit. Craddock had submitted his resignation earlier in the day, citing “personal reasons.” The independent probe’s report will likely do little for family members of the victims who have been grasping for answers and critical of the investigations. A police investigation into the massacre is ongoing. An         update in September from police investigators did not offer a clear motive, either. Jason Nixon, whose wife Kate Nixon was killed by Craddock, said the independent investigation was a “dog and pony show” that “regurgitated” information provided by Virginia Beach police. He said no real independent digging was done. “Family members are beyond upset,” he said. Nixon said his wife wrote up Craddock for having a poor attitude. But he said such details were glossed over. Nixon said he plans to ask state police to conduct an investigation. Meanwhile, the probe offered several recommendations to the city. They included suggestions that Virginia Beach improve its workplace violence prevention programs, human resources functions and mass-notification alerting systems. The independent investigation, however, was also somewhat limited in scope. The security firm did not have access to Craddock’s personal computer, which Heintze attributed to an ongoing investigation by the FBI. Dwight Brown, whose daughter LaQuita Brown was killed, said after Wednesday’s presentation that independent investigators failed to talk to him during their probe. Heintze responded that they had talked to at least some members of her family. Heintze also underscored the challenge of trying to understand someone like Craddock. Heintze described the shooter as “truly isolated and such a loner” that he didn’t have relationships with people “who could have provided some insight.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-11-13 19:55:08, Probe offers no clear answers for Virginia mass shooting,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

And it's one he thinks will continue across the United States. U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman awoke Sunday morning Aug. 4 to see that Attorney General Bill Barr, among other law enforcement officials, was trying to reach him with the call that he had dreaded. There had been a         deadly mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio. Often during his three years as lead federal prosecutor for the region that includes Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus, Glassman had reacted to such shootings elsewhere by calling the Cincinnati FBI's leader to discuss what they might need to do, concluding ""but for the grace of God go us."" Glassman discussed the Dayton shooting, other major cases, and his future in a wide-ranging Associated Press interview Tuesday. Appointed during the Democrat Barack Obama's administration,         Glassman will step down Friday in favor of Republican President Donald Trump's just-confirmed nominee, David DeVillers, a Columbus-based veteran assistant U.S. attorney. The Dayton gunman's motive remains under investigation, with the         FBI looking into what role interest in violent ideologies might have had on Connor Betts, 24. Glassman said he couldn't give a timetable on the probe. But while he can't speculate about Betts, he believes there are many more potential mass killers still out there. ""What we have increasingly seen in the last few years are individuals who for whatever reason seem like they're really inclined to commit violence. And they can find on the internet the reasons that are sufficient in their own minds to go out and commit mass violence,"" Glassman said. ""Of course, it's just really easy to access weapons and ammunition that can cause horrific violence. And with all these things together, that (mass shootings) is going to be a continuing problem."" Glassman said while still part of the Justice Department he wouldn't discuss public policy changes he'd like to see on gun ownership. But he appeals to everyday Americans to reach out to authorities if they see that a friend or family member appears to be turning toward mass violence. His office successfully prosecuted several cases of U.S. residents who wanted to kill either here or abroad in support of the Islamic State extremists. Although he said it's clearly better for national security to have fewer active Islamic State extremists, Glassman added that susceptible people will adopt varying ideologies. He said U.S. authorities have seen people appear headed to becoming jihadi extremists, disappear from the federal radar, then reappear communicating with violent white nationalists. He said just as the Islamic State recruits Americans via social media from the Middle East, white nationalists are recruiting from Europe. His office has also prosecuted economic espionage cases involving other countries targeting U.S. companies, such as in         last year's arrest of a Chinese spy accused of trying to steal trade secrets from U.S. aviation and aerospace companies. ""I think we're beginning to get a handle on it and I think it is probably more pervasive than we have been aware of until recently,"" Glassman said. ""I think it's fair to say that pretty much any company that is engaged in any kind of high-tech research and development probably has been targeted."" Glassman provided quick updates on some pending cases: — Efforts are continuing to return for trial in Cincinnati a Catholic priest,         Kenneth Hendricks , charged with multiple counts of child sex abuse in the Philippines. — His prosecutors are ""prepared to move forward"" in the case of a young man charged with lying to FBI agents about being a long-missing child.         Brian Rini , 24, is being held without bond in Butler County Jail pending a ruling on his competency. —         A review continues into the possibility of prosecuting a white former University of Cincinnati police officer for civil rights violations in the case of an unarmed black motorist he fatally shot in 2015. Two juries deadlocked on murder charges against Ray Tensing, who said he felt his life was in danger when he Sam DuBose, 43, in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate. Glassman plans to remain temporarily as an assistant to help DeVillers' transition. At 44, the married father of young twins isn't sure what's ahead for him in the future. ""Public service has been a joy for me,"" he said, saying that while stepping away soon, ""I hope it's not the last time that I am involved in public service."" —— Follow Dan Sewell at         https://www.twitter.com/dansewell 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-10-30 01:10:57, AP Interview: Mass shootings haunt federal prosecutor,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/
415,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/beto-orourke-ending-presidential-campaign-sources/story?id=66698737,"Aides said there's no indication he'll run for anything in the immediate future. Beto O'Rourke speaks after dropping out of presidential race Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, announced on Twitter that he's dropping out of the 2020 presidential race. About an hour after informing his staff he was dropping out of the race, O'Rourke joined surprised supporters and volunteers stationed outside an arena in Des Moines, Iowa, where he was scheduled to speak at the Liberty & Justice Celebration Friday night. He spoke for about 15 minutes thanking those who he worked alongside during his campaign that began with high expectations and recently struggled to gain more than 2% in nationwide polls. ""Though this is the end of this campaign, we are right in the middle of this fight. I will do everything that I can to support the eventual nominee of this party with everything that I've got, and I encourage every single one of you to do the same,"" he said. O'Rourke urged his backers to support ""whoever the nominee is"" for the Democrats, and to not only ""support them against Donald Trump and make sure that they're successful in November of 2020, but also importantly, making sure that they help to bring together a very divided country in the face of the greatest set of challenges that we've ever known."" Campaign aides told ABC News there is no indication O'Rourke will run for anything in the immediate future. In a recent interview with Politico prior to dropping out O'Rourke said, “I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I’m not the nominee.” O'Rourke told ABC News he is now focused on doing whatever he can for this country. “No longer, as a candidate. But with my fellow Americans.” As for what’s next for the congressman – he said he is heading back home Saturday to be with his family, friends and supporters. His supporters and volunteers were emotional, tears falling as they took down his campaign lawn signs on Friday. O'Rourke stayed behind for over an hour to thank his supporters and team individually. As he got into his car, the congressman told ABC News he was “grateful” to be part of it all. The Democrat announced his candidacy in March, prompting media attention and polling numbers that put him among the then-front-runners and leading to an impressive first-day fundraising haul of $6.1 million. But O'Rourke's stock steadily declined in the following months, with lackluster debate performances, a steep drop in fundraising and a plunge in the polls -- registering no more than 3% or 4% in some national and state polls. He eventually failed to secure two additional polls to qualify for the November debate, which will be hosted in Georgia by MSNBC and The Washington Post. O'Rourke announced his White House bid just months after losing a closely watched 2018 midterm race in which he challenged Republican stalwart Sen. Ted Cruz, losing by just 3 percentage points. It was the closest race Texas had seen in recent decades. O'Rourke raised a record $38 million in one quarter of 2018, three times Cruz's totals for the same period and the most raised in a U.S. Senate race in history. Finding viral and documentary fame, O'Rourke traveled to all of Texas' 254 counties, including ones not visited by Democrats in years. It was a strategy he later applied to his presidential bid following a racially motivated mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, that claimed the lives of 22 people. When re-launching his presidential campaign in El Paso after a 12-day hiatus from the trail, O'Rourke said he'd propose a mandatory buy-back program for assault rifles. The proposal was criticized by a number of his Democratic opponents and became a common Republican talking point when defending gun rights. While pushing the policy boundaries on topics like gun control, marijuana legalization and immigration, O'Rourke also faced scrutiny from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party for not backing policies like ""Medicare for All,"" instead preferring Medicare for America, a policy that would keep private employee-based health care options.

416,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/florida-judge-draws-towns-wrath-school-violence-case-67071443,"Residents in a rural northern Florida community are fuming over a judge’s decision to dismiss a case against a 15-year-old who shared a six-page “School Shooting Plan” with a classmate MACCLENNY, Fla. -- Anxieties multiplied quickly across Baker County, a mostly rural community of 28,000 in northern Florida, when news spread that a 15-year-old had planned a massacre at the county’s only high school. ""MAKE SURE THE TEACHERS ARE DEAD,"" he ranted in a notebook. ""Then rinse repeat."" When the sophomore shared his six-page ""School Shooting Plan"" with a classmate in early September, it set in motion what authorities called a textbook response to averting another Parkland school shooting, which took the lives of 14 students and three school staffers last year. Within minutes, the student was in custody. By most accounts, parents felt reassured by the swift action of school officials and law enforcement. But unease resurfaced last month when a judge dismissed second-degree felony charges against the boy and released him back into the community west of Jacksonville. Thursday’s shooting at a California high school — which left three students dead, including the 16-year-old gunman — only deepened their worries. In a place where churches outnumber gas stations and traffic lights, some residents expressed compassion for the teenager but reserved less mercy for the judge, who they say failed their community and the boy she spared. “We have a sense of safety built into this community. We trust each other, and when I drop my kids off at school, I have a feeling they’re going to be safe,” said Macclenny resident Tracy Lamb, whose 15-year-old daughter attends the high school along with about 1,400 other students. “Our judicial system is dropping the ball. It’s failed us, and the system has failed him. I want this child to receive help,” she said. “Everybody’s left wondering now about what’s going to happen to this particular kid.” After the Parkland shooting that killed 17, Florida lawmakers acted quickly to beef up security and improve safety across the state’s 4,300 public schools. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act widened the authority of schools and law enforcement to act against any threat to campus safety. To authorities and school officials, one provision in the law seemed clear: Anyone who “makes, posts, or transmits” a threat of mass shooting “in any manner that would allow another person to view the threat” has committed a crime. Judge Gloria R. Walker saw things differently and dismissed the case because she said prosecutors could not prove the threat had been transmitted as described in the law. Walker didn’t return calls requesting comment. Members of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission expressed exasperation last month when Baker County Sheriff’s Maj. Randy Crews described the incident. That was the first time many in the county heard of the judge’s decision, and it spawned immediate outrage. Community leaders urged neighbors to bombard the judge with emails and phone calls to voice their displeasure. ""We count on the laws to keep us safe. Are there laws to do that? We thought so, and then recently we had a judge who said that the law wasn't good enough to keep us safe, or to get this child some help,” said Angela Callahan, a middle school teacher, union officer and mother with a son attending Baker County High School. The boy’s plan described killing teachers and fellow students in chilling detail. To maximize the carnage, he’d deploy an arsenal of knives and guns at a pep rally or some other high-traffic venue. He calculated he’d have nine minutes before squad cars and medics could reach the scene. He wouldn’t be acting alone, he hoped, having recruited at least three schoolmates who, like him, were ""100% down that they might die that day."" Investigators said the teen acknowledged writing the plan but he denied any intention of carrying it out. The Associated Press is not naming the student because he is a juvenile. Florida law allows authorities to hold anyone deemed a threat to themselves and others for up to 72 hours. From July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018, authorities took temporary custody of 36,078 children under the Baker Act — up by 83% from a decade earlier. Many of those cases were initiated while a child was at school. The Stoneman Douglas commission has called for greater state funding for mental health programs for children and wants judges to offer mental health services to children who get into trouble with the law. That’s what folks across Baker County say should have happened when the 15-year-old appeared before Judge Walker. The Rev. Tommy Richardson, who serves as the chaplain for the sheriff’s department, said his community is a place of forgiveness. “I don’t think none of the community ever expected him to get life in prison,” Richardson said. “We’re a community that will help him, pray for him.” Baker County Schools Superintendent Sherrie Raulerson declined to discuss the case but reassured residents that protocols are in place to keep students safe. Still, concerns linger. Courtney Fiser, whose daughter attends the high school, said she is relieved the boy hasn’t returned to school but remains troubled by the judge’s decision. “We work so hard to protect our children, and we have someone who is not there helping us,” she said. Daughter Lauren, a cheerleader, described the unease on campus. When the school intercom blared a code yellow a few weeks ago, nerves remained frayed until school officials declared it a false alarm. “Every time the doorknob makes a noise, we’re scared,” she said. “Now, It’s just an ongoing fear.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2019-11-16 15:13:40, Florida judge draws town’s wrath over school violence case,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

Gunman opens fire on family’s football watch party in California A search is on for the gunmen who killed four and injured six others in a ""targeted"" mass shooting in a Fresno, California, backyard Sunday night, authorities said. About 30 people were at the Fresno home for a ""quiet"" and ""peaceful"" family party to watch football before it turned into a ""mass casualty event,"" Fresno Police Chief Andrew Hall said at a news conference Monday. Just before 8 p.m. local time, at least two suspects, both armed with pistols, walked into the backyard ""and began immediately firing into the crowd,"" Hall said. About 16 men were in the backyard at the time, he said, and 10 of those 16 men were struck by bullets. The CEO of the Fresno Center, Pao Yang, said two of the victims who died were well-known singers in the Hmong community. ""They come out and perform... especially gearing up for Hmong New Year,"" Yang said. ""Our community is in mourning."" The four people killed were all men, ages 23, 31, 38 and 40 years old, according to the chief. The suspects never entered the home, where the rest of the partygoers were, according to police. Witnesses described only seeing flashes of light from the gun, the chief said. Children were inside the home but none of them were hurt, authorities said. The house was not struck. The unknown suspects fled on foot, said Hall. He described the mass shooting as a ""targeted act of violence against this residence"" and said some people at this home may have been involved in a disturbance earlier this week. While the attack seemed targeted, the gunmen appeared to fire at random, Hall said. There is no indication that anyone at the home was affiliated with a gang, Hall said, adding, ""at this point we have not ruled gang involvement out."" Authorities are ""investigating several leads"" and the Fresno Police Department is forming an Asian gang task force, according to Hall. Fresno Police Capt.

419,https://abcnews.go.com/US/suburban-revolt-boosts-democrats-age-trump-analysis/story?id=66791338,"The revenge of the suburbs continues in the age of President Donald Trump. Kentucky's Republican governor Matt Bevin refuses to concede The revenge of the suburbs continues in the age of President Donald Trump. On yet another Election Day, the president’s disruptive style and conservative policy pushes brought a clearly identifiable backlash. On Tuesday, Democratic statewide and local candidates from Virginia through Kentucky, Iowa and Pennsylvania saw their vote margins boosted by suburban voters -- and women in particular -- overcoming the allure of Trumpism in a range of races. The results cost Republicans full control of the state government in Richmond for the first time in a quarter century. They also left the GOP governor of Kentucky trailing a Democrat by some 5,000 votes -- in a state Trump carried by 30 points in 2016. The results serve as a counterweight to the unquestioned popularity of Trump inside a large swatch of his Republican base. It raises questions about Trump’s reelection, as well as the more immediate politics of impeachment, as Republicans confront a changed electoral landscape. ""The Trump presidency has generated a much deeper level of hostility that has been very helpful to Democratic candidates,"" Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington, told ABC News. ""There are demographic changes in the suburbs ... there's more racial and ethnic and age diversity in the suburbs, they're not as Republican as they used to be."" ""The results on Tuesday might well be seen as a warning sign for Republicans thinking about suburban voters and 2020 around the country,"" he added. Democrats see their wins as a blueprint for 2020, in races down the ballot and all the way to the top. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the results in Kentucky and Virginia in particular showed that Democrats can romp in cities and suburbs and even stay close in rural areas when they present their values in contrast to divisive Republicans. “We competed everywhere, and we were competitive everywhere,” Perez told reporters Wednesday morning at a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor. “When you continue to divide America, that is not only un-American, that is going to prove to be terrible politics for you.” Perez said he was particularly gratified to see suburban women and young voters engaged in Tuesday’s elections. In Virginia, a major issue was legislative inaction to confront gun violence after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach earlier this year; in Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin’s efforts to roll back Medicaid coverage was a key issue raised by Democrat Andy Beshear. Election Day 2019 saw a continuation of trends that played out nationwide in 2017 and then particularly in the 2018 midterm races. Democrats last year captured a majority in the House with wins in suburban races not just outside New York, Philadelphia, Miami and Chicago, but around Memphis, Salt Lake City, Houston and Dallas. A year later, with just a tiny sample of high-profile races on the ballot in off-year elections, Democrats swept into full control of state government in Virginia, which was a GOP stronghold barely a decade ago. They did that by running a diverse slate of candidates and doubling down on suburbs outside of Washington, D.C., picking up at least two key Senate seats in Northern Virginia and the state capitol that had long been held by the GOP. They also made significant House gains in the Tidewater in southeast corner of the state. Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Beshear was able to run up the score in urban centers and surrounding areas, while keeping pace, just enough in more rural parts of the state. Some local outlets questioned late Tuesday whether President Donald Trump’s visit to the state could have actually backfired and helped Beshear at least locally in Lexington. The numbers showed Beshear outperforming expectations in Lexington, which typically has been the more conservative of the state’s two big cities, with 66% of the vote in Fayette County. He also delivered a strong performance in Louisville's Jefferson County (67% to 32%), according to unofficial results. Beshear also overperformed in the northern portion of the state, in the suburbs of Cincinnati, where he took Campbell and Kenton Counties by narrow margins. For comparison, Trump's Democratic challenger in 2016, Hillary Clinton, only won the two counties covering the state's major cities, Louisville and Lexington. Beshear won 21 counties that Trump carried in 2016. Additionally, voter turnout in Kentucky was significantly higher than expected. Despite Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes predicting only 31% of registered voters would participate, according to the Kentucky State Board of Elections, about 42% of registered voters cast ballots for Tuesday's election, a high mark for an off-year election. In 2015, turn out was 31%. The 2019 elections were far from wipeouts for Republicans. The GOP candidate won the governor’s race in Mississippi, and Republicans captured five of the six statewide races in Kentucky -- including by electing its first ever African American attorney general. Republicans also lost a few legislative seats in blue New Jersey. With Trump headed to Louisiana Wednesday night, Republicans continue to feel confident about their chances in the final gubernatorial race of the year. The Democratic incumbent is up for reelection a week from Saturday. Kentucky remains deep red at the national level. The state’s senior senator, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is up for reelection himself next year, and his team remains confident of McConnell’s reelection and the longer-term prospects for Republicans -- signaling Bevin's struggles might be uniquely his own. ""President Trump’s rally helped five of six Kentucky Republicans win clear statewide victories ... the president just about dragged Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line, helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end. A final outcome remains to be seen,"" Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager said in a statement Tuesday night. Still, the landscape reflects a regional realignment that’s been evident in almost every election held while Trump has been in office. Republicans face real challenges in suburban areas and with women voters that the president doesn’t seem able to overcome with his force of personality. ""I think, at least temporarily, we're seeing across the country a rejection of Trump's GOP by voters who used to be part of the Republican winning coalition,"" said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky. ""Whether that's permanent ... or instead it's a temporary loss by the Republicans while they're in power, no one can really say."" ""Statewide, the Republicans did so well, aside from Bevin, with statewide leaders who don't really seem cut from the Trump mold in the same way Bevin was, that I doubt it's a major concern for Kentucky's Republicans,"" he said of the suburban vote. ""But on the national stage, the loss of educated, affluent, center-right voters should be a major concern and it threatens a bloodbath in 2020 for the GOP if that pattern continues.""

Like other contenders for the party’s 2020 nomination, Sanders would decriminalize border crossings and provide a pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million people without legal residency in the country. But he also went further, pledging to temporarily halt all deportations, end federal immigration raids and break up two federal agencies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, that have been at the forefront of President Trump’s family separation policy. Advertisement Denouncing what he called Trump’s demonization of immigrants, Sanders said the immigration proposal was personal because his father “came to America as a refugee without a nickel in his pocket, to escape widespread anti-Semitism and find a better life.” “When I am in the White House we will stop the hatred towards our immigrant brothers and sisters, end family separation, and locking children up in cages,” he said in a written statement. “We will end the ICE raids that are terrorizing our communities, and on my first day as president, I will use my executive power to protect our immigrant communities and reverse every single horrific action implemented by Trump.” Immigration has been a fraught topic for a Democratic Party caught in a battle between its moderate and more progressive wings. Presidential candidates initially sought to stay away from the polarized issue, even as public outcry mounted over reports of abuse at immigrant detention centers and the deaths of migrants along the border amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on asylum. But Julián Castro, the only Latino in the race and grandson of Mexican immigrants, was the first to put out a detailed immigration proposal and set the agenda on the issue when he called to decriminalize illegally entering the United States during the first presidential debates in June. Advertisement Nearly all Democratic contenders have come out in favor of the move since, though some political consultants have expressed concern the candidates could risk alienating Republicans fed up with Trump and more moderate general election voters who support strict immigration enforcement. Sanders’s proposal comes as he has gained Latino support in polls and as immigration has risen to the forefront for many Latino families after the El Paso mass shooting, in which a gunman drove into the city on a self-described quest to kill Mexicans and Mexican immigrants. Key to drafting Sanders proposal were young Latino immigrants on his staff, including several beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative. The Obama-era program — rescinded by Trump last year — has provided permits for some 800,000 immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children to work and go to school. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next week on a case that could decide the fate of the program. “We wrote this plan for our immigrant community,” said Belén Sisa, 25, a DACA recipient from Arizona and a press secretary for Sanders’ campaign. “We have been promised immigration reform for far too long, and this plan says we need action now because our community cannot keep suffering.” Advertisement Luis Alcauter, 30, a campaign staffer from Fresno, California, who was brought to the country at 13, said he, Sisa and other DACA recipients got involved in drafting Sanders’ proposal organically -- out of concern for themselves and their families. “I want to make sure that I could continue to contribute to this country that gave me so much, but I also wanted to make sure that we could pursue future opportunities without fear of deportation,” Alcauter said of his efforts to preserve DACA. In his immigration plan, Sanders pledges to immediately restore the DACA program through executive action, and to look for ways to use executive power to bring back a similar Obama-era program for the parents of DACA recipients that was blocked by the courts. Sanders also promised to use executive power to provide protection from deportation for any person who has lived, worked and made contributions to the country for the past five years, “even if he has to sign every form by hand.” His immigration proposal ties in other major parts of his platform, including expanding healthcare, free college tuition and worker protections, and makes them available for all immigrants without lawful residency status in the US. Like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and others, Sanders said he would reverse Trump administration policies that have banned travel to the United States from several Muslim-majority countries, capped the number of people who can apply for asylum each day, and required migrants to wait in Mexico while their immigration cases are decided. Advertisement Sanders also joined in other candidates in promising to stop the construction of a wall along the southern border and to restore US aid to Latin American countries, where extreme poverty, drug war violence and corruption have caused many to flee. But its immigrant authors said the plan’s most revolutionary measures would place a moratorium on deportations as a Sanders’ overhaul of the immigration system is underway and break up of CBP and ICE, two federal agencies under the Department of Homeland Security that played a crucial role in the separations of migrant children from their families in 2018 at the nation’s southwestern border, spurring #abolishICE protests at agency offices. Under Sanders’ proposal, the duties of the federal immigration enforcement agencies would be moved to other federal agencies. That would resemble the system before the Department of Homeland Security was formed after the 9/11 terrorism attacks. Deportations and border enforcement would be under the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department would once again assume authority of customs, the State Department would take over responsibility for naturalization and citizenship. Basi Alonso, 30-year-old Sanders campaign organizer who helped write the proposal, said the restructuring would return humanity to the immigration system. She was brought to New York when she was three years old from a small town in Puebla, Mexico, after her father, a law student, was kidnapped for his work as a community organizer. Unlike others who disappeared, she said, he was released after her family paid a ransom. Advertisement “If he had stayed in Mexico, he probably would have died,” she said, calling the violence a reality for many families making the long and dangerous trek to the US. “What Bernie’s plan says is, ‘We are going to stop deportations to build a system that works for people who want to come to this country and are seeking refuge in this country.’” Reach Jazmine Ulloa at jazmine.ulloa@globe.com or on Twitter: @jazmineulloa Digital Access Home Delivery Gift Subscriptions Log In Manage My Account Customer Service Help & FAQs Globe Newsroom Advertise Newsletters View the ePaper Order Back Issues News in Education Search the Archives Privacy Policy Terms of Service Terms of Purchase Work at Boston Globe Media",2019-11-07 00:00:00,Bernie Sanders unveils ambitious immigration plan that offers a path for citizenship and dismantles ICE - The Boston Globe,,15,https://www.bostonglobe.com/

For many Americans, this mass shooting may have gotten lost in the blur of the El Paso mass shooting, the Dayton mass shooting, and all of the other all-too-frequent cases of horrific mass-casualty violence. But in Virginia, locals reacted strongly. Governor Ralph Northam called a special session on gun control, but the Republicans who controlled the chamber quickly voted to adjourn, asking a bipartisan commission to come up with recommendations and postponing the report until after Election Day. Virginia Democrats accused Republicans of shirking their duties and subsequently enjoyed big wins in state legislative elections earlier this month. Virginia Democrats knew that the proper response to Virginia Beach shooting was gun control — and didn’t need to wait until the full investigation of the shooter had concluded. Unnervingly, law enforcement officials say they still have no idea why the shooter launched his attack. The city asked a security risk management firm to conduct a comprehensive review to see if any warnings or “red flags” were missed. The extensive report concluded the shooter’s “actions, behaviors and communications before the attack did not include many known pre-incident risk factors for targeted workplace violence . . . We found no evidence that the subject communicated his violent intentions to others before the attack . . . The subject had no known history of mental health care and treatment . . . The subject left no clear evidence of a plan or manifesto detailing his intent and rationale or revealing any observable pre-attack behaviors.” The report added, “some of the subject’s coworkers described him as reserved, with little emotional affect and socially withdrawn. No one, however, described him, his behaviors or his communications as overtly aggressive or violent. None of the coworkers interviewed thought the subject posed a threat or would commit such a violent act.” This man had nothing more than seemingly mundane problems at work, a reprimand for poor performance. He begun the process of filing a formal grievance over his assessment, but then dropped his efforts, nine months before the incident. He had completed a divorce nearly two years earlier. But the report cautions “the three risk factors associated with this attacker — weapons skills and/or access, recent job problems and personal stressors — in their reported context of his professional work environment would not normally rise to a perceived level of concern for violence toward others.” Not every gun owner in the country who’s annoyed with boss or went through a divorce is a threat to others. But there’s still that little detail that nothing Virginia Democrats are proposing would have changed what happened in Virginia Beach if it had been law. Even if all of the Democrats’ desired laws had been in effect for the past few decades in Virginia, none of them would have prevented or even mitigated the actions of the Virginia Beach shooter.

No suspects have been identified. By Jacey Fortin, Thomas Fuller and Mihir Zaveri [Sign up for our daily newsletter about news from California here.] Four people were fatally shot and six others wounded after at least two people opened fire at a family gathering in Fresno, Calif., on Sunday, then fled, the authorities said. No suspects had been identified as of Monday morning, and the police said they were collecting statements from witnesses and running shell casings through a national database. The motive and number of assailants were unknown. About 30 friends and family members were at the gathering at a home in Fresno when the gunfire began, Andy Hall, the chief of the Fresno Police Department, said at a news conference on Monday. The authorities received reports of the shooting shortly before 8 p.m. local time. Chief Hall said the gunmen, who were armed with pistols, entered the property through an unlocked gate and began firing at people who were watching football in the yard. “They walked through the backyard and began immediately firing through the crowd,” he said. “The witnesses described only seeing flashes of light from the weapon, as it was too dark on that side of the house to see the suspects.” He added that the party was “just a family event” and had been peaceful and quiet until that moment. [Fearing a mass shooting, police officers in the Seattle area took a man’s guns. A judge gave them back.] Late Monday, the authorities identified the four men killed as Xy Lee, 23, Phia Vang, 31, Kou Xiong, 38, and Kalaxang Thao, 40, all from Fresno. Mr. Xiong lived at house where the shooting occurred, officials said. Michael Reid, a deputy chief of the police department, said that all 10 of the victims were Asian men, and added that several children were at the party. “Thank God that no kids were hurt,” he said. Mr. Reid said three of the men died in the yard, and one died after being taken to a nearby hospital. Six others were taken to hospitals with nonlife-threatening injuries, he said. “This was not a random act,” Chief Hall said at the news conference on Monday. “It appears that this incident was a targeted act of violence against this residence. We are investigating leads, and we do have information that possibly some people at this party were involved in a disturbance earlier this week.” He added that while the department was convening a task force to focus on Asian gangs in the area, there was no indication that the people at the party were affiliated with gangs. Miguel Arias, the vice president of the Fresno City Council, said the people killed in the shooting were ethnic Hmong, members of a large community that arrived in Fresno as refugees from the wars in Laos and Vietnam starting in the 1970s. “It’s heartbreaking for the Hmong community,” Mr. Arias said. “They came from a war-torn country and sought refuge here — and now they are now victims of this latest mass shooting.” Pao Yang, the chief executive of the Fresno Center, a nonprofit community organization, said that two of the men who died were singers who were well known in the Hmong community. Blong Xiong, a former City Council member in Fresno and a leader of the Hmong community, said the shooting came just as Hmong families in California were making plans to gather for the new year, which occurs at different times from October through December depending on the city. “We are supposed to be celebrating,” he said. “This is senseless violence,” Mr. Reid said. “We’re going to do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are and bring them to justice.” The shooting occurred at 5361 East Lamona Avenue, just south of Fresno Yosemite International Airport. Videos posted on social media showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street lined with residential homes. Fresno, a sprawling city of more than 500,000 people, is surrounded by vast expanses of almond and fruit trees. It is about 175 miles southeast of Sacramento. California, which has some of the toughest gun laws in the nation, has had a rash of mass shootings in recent weeks. On Thursday, a 16-year-old student killed two of his classmates and wounded three others in a shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita, Calif. Two shootings at separate Halloween parties, one in a San Francisco suburb and another in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, killed a total of eight people. The shooting at an Airbnb rental in Orinda, the San Francisco suburb, appeared to involve rival gangs, David Livingston, the sheriff of Contra Costa County, said at a news briefing Friday. A total of 10 people were shot in what the sheriff called a “blood bath.” Daniel Victor and Aimee Ortiz contributed reporting.

425,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1897284,"Milwaukee police arrested Clifton A. Blackwell, a 61-year-old white man suspected of throwing acid in the face of Mahud Villalaz, a U.S. citizen originally from Peru, resulting in second- and third-degree burns, as reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Police have not confirmed the identity of the suspect they arrested. Villalaz says that before his attacker threw acid on him, he called him an “illegal” and told him to “go back to your country.” ""I believe (I) am a victim of a hate crime because (of) how he approached me,"" Villalaz told CNN-affiliate WISN. The assault occurred outside of a Mexican restaurant on Friday. Villalaz said the man initially confronted him about how he had parked his car. “He started talking like, ‘You don’t respect my laws. You can’t invade my country, so go back to your country,’” Villalaz recalled to NBC News. Villalaz said he ignored the man, moved his car, and when he came back toward the restaurant, the older man was waiting for him with an open bottle. The situation quickly escalated from there. A nearby surveillance camera caught the attack on video, embedded at the bottom of this post, which shows a man splashing a liquid onto Villalaz’s face. The video does not include audio. Immediately after the attack, Villalaz said he went to the restaurant’s bathroom and rinsed his face with water. Villalaz said doctors believed the liquid was battery acid. It also burned his jacket, sweater, and shirt. Police are investigating the attack as a hate crime. ""To single out someone because they're from a Hispanic origin is simply wrong. And we know what's happening,"" said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. ""Everybody knows what's happening. It's because the president is talking about it on a daily basis that people feel they have license to go after Hispanic people. And it's wrong.” The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first identified the attacker as Blackwell. According to Blackwell’s mother, Jacqueline Blackwell, he is a military veteran who lives with PTSD. As reported by the Journal Sentinel, state court records show that Blackwell was convicted in 2006 for false imprisonment and pointing a gun at a person as well as confronting men over entering his farm property to track a deer, though few details are available online. As the survivor, a 42-year-old father, explained to The New York Times, his sons, ages seven and five, have struggled with understanding the attack. “The younger one started crying and said, ‘Why would somebody do this to you, Daddy, when you did nothing to him?’” Villalaz said. “How do you explain this to a little boy?” These are questions that too many children are probably wondering. Anti-immigrant rhetoric is toxic and, as demonstrated again and again, deeply dangerous. The attacker’s alleged “go back” threat is familiar from the words of Donald Trump when he told four freshman Democratic congresswomen—frequently known as the “squad”—to “go back” to their own countries. And of course, the deadly mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas Walmart was fueled by white supremacy and anti-immigrant hate. A video from the surveillance footage is embedded in the below tweet: #BREAKING - Video shows the moment a man was hit with battery acid.

When sworn in, these Democratic majority members will spell certain relief for the progressives struggling to expand freedom in the Old Dominion … Election 2019: The Democrats Strike Back Well, hell. They went and did it. Virginia Democrats flipped both the House of Delegates and the state Senate. And now they have trifecta control of state government (House + Senate + gov).   Anyway, I haven’t been waiting for this for the full 26 years, but … yeah, I’ve been waiting for this for a long time. You see, the Democrats of the Virginia General Assembly are the whole reason I do this. All of this. Any of this. Okay I’d only been voting for a couple of years at that point but still ‘Twas extremely not so in 2009. The 2010 GOP wave lapped at the shores of Virginia that year, and instead of flipping the six seats they needed to end the Republican House majority, Democrats lost five seats. Fifteen House seats. Freaking amazing. But I had to wait a WHOLE TWO YEARS for Democrats to maybe flip the legislature, and that’s, like, a political eternity. Anything could happen. Make no mistake: Democrats flipped the Virginia General Assembly despite Ralph Northam, not, as he has inexplicably tried to claim, because of him. But … what happened? How did Democrats pull off what seemed basically impossible just a handful of years ago: legislative majorities and trifecta control of state government? But there was so much more to it than that. I sat down yesterday and wrote down my MANY THOUGHTS on this for Gen by Medium, and you should extremely definitely go read it. But the nuts and bolts are thus: And flipping just two seats in each chamber might have looked simple enough on paper. But a variety of factors baked in to politics in the Old Dominion made this lift heavier than it appeared. Factor 1: Majorities matter. Which brings us to ... Factor 2: Money matters. Factor 3: Maps matter. Factor 4: Turnout matters. But so what? Democrats won big on Tuesday, so do these things, like, really matter? You bet they do. But all these factors ended up turning in Democrats’ favor this cycle. Here’s how. Majorities: Money: Maps: And finally, turnout: So now, after decades in the wilderness, Democrats will son be running the show in Virginia. And they have a wicked ambitious agenda: ratifying the ERA, establishing LGBTQ protections, passing gun safety measures, expanding voting rights, raising the minimum wage, legalizing marijuana … But being in charge brings its own challenges. But in the end, these are okay problems to have. Virginia Republicans would give their eyeteeth to be facing these issues right about now. Congratulations! You made it to the end of this especially weedy, totally Virginia-focused epic. I hope you’ll stay tuned next week, when I’ll be returning to regularly scheduled programming. Like, with stuff from states that aren’t Virginia. But for hanging in like a champ, you deserve to get an early start on your weekend. Pop a bottle for Virginia Dems and take tomorrow off.

427,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1899040,"For tl;dr readers: While the NRA is weaker than it was in 2013, while grassroots activism for stricter gun laws is more energized and boosted by youth’s participation, and while Democrats are much bolder on the subject than historically, it’s still likely that universal background checks for gun transactions will be the only serious new federal gun law reform passed come 2021 even if Democrats control the White House and a majority in both houses of Congress. That would be a babystep in controlling gun violence but far short of all that’s needed, which includes licensing of all gun owners and the registration of all their guns. The author is a gun owner. A number of Democratic politicians, including presidential candidates, have backed away from the view that support for new federal gun restrictions is an automatic loser at the polls. Several have introduced aggressive proposals. Julián Castro, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris have developed the most comprehensive approaches, some of them focusing on the roots of gun violence. Beto O’Rourke has called not just for the banning of new sales of civilian versions of military assault rifles, but also mandatory confiscation with compensation for such guns now in private hands. Included in Joe Biden’s gun proposals is a ban on new sales, but no confiscation. He would instead establish a national registry of all semi-auto assault rifles and their owners, the same as the federal government has maintained since 1934 for automatic weapons. But even if Democrats gain a Senate majority, proposals like O’Rourke’s, Biden’s, and those of other Democratic presidential candidates will be extremely difficult to turn into law even with stepped-up efforts by the highly energized grassroots groups now pushing reform. There was a long stretch of time during which most Democratic politicians had very little to say about even the mildest new gun restrictions. A time when some Democratic presidential candidates would make sure their campaign had a fresh photograph or video of them out hunting, even if the last time they had brought home any game was 30 years before. They pandered and they cowered. Their consultants told them that was the safe course. It was a time—starting in the 1980s—when the National Rifle Association began persuading legislators in state after state to loosen their gun laws, first lobbying to get states to issue concealed pistol permits (which had nearly everywhere been a rare commodity for decades) to just about anyone without a criminal record. And subsequently, starting in 2010, the gun lobby has persuaded legislators to go one step further by authorizing “constitutional carry.” That means no permit and no training is required to carry a firearm anywhere, openly or concealed, just as they claim the drafters of the Second Amendment intended. A decade ago, only two states allowed this; today, 16 have passed “constitutional carry” laws, with more expected. Simultaneous with the offensive drive it began in the 1980s, the NRA has also pressed hard on defense to keep states from passing a range of laws: A few states have resisted the gun merchants lobby, but the majority have given the NRA all or most of what it wants. Now, however, in some states and at the national level, the political atmosphere on firearms is changing with each new mass shooting. While its message is the same as it has been for decades, the NRA—faced with its own high-profile internal squabbles and financial antics, as well as being tainted by its association with Russian agents—is no longer the powerhouse it once was. And thanks at least in part to the youthful activism that followed the massacre of 17 students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School nearly two years ago, plus organizations like Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America funded by the Michael Bloomberg-founded Everytown for Gun Safety, more elected Democrats than ever have dared to speak up about gun law reform, often directly challenging the NRA. Mass shootings have been the big driver of opinion. Last February, there was a glimpse of the possible future of reform when the House of Representatives approved H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. The bill passed 240-190, with eight Republicans for it, and two Democrats against. It calls for universal background checks for every firearm transaction except those within an immediate family. Private sales without a background check would be prohibited, with no way to legally get around the scrutiny of the background check by buying at gun shows or via arrangements made on the internet. Nobody knows for certain how many private sales take place each year, but one survey put it at 13%. While that may seem modest, it amounts to 1.7 million firearms. Despite polls showing that 83%-94% of Americans, including gun owners and NRA members, support background checks for everyone buying a firearm, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—who has received $1.3 million in campaign donations from the NRA over the course of his career—has kept S. 42, the Senate version of H.R. 8 with 41 Democratic co-sponsors, bottled up in committee. It will almost certainly stay that way right through 2020, just as will Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s perennial bill—S. 66—to ban new sales of assault weapons. Unless numerous Senate Republicans decide that a universal background check might be useful to them at the polls next year, national gun reform is stymied for the next 14 months. But what would be the impact on gun law reform if the 2020 election were to give Democrats a Senate majority, produce a still bigger majority in the House, and boot whichever Republican is sitting in the Oval Office come next November? Wouldn’t there then be some progress beyond background checks for everyone? It depends. In 2013, in the wake of the massacre of 26 children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School by a man armed with an AR-15, there was a widespread hope that this time, finally, because first graders had been gunned down, significant progress would be made regardless of what the NRA and other gun lobbies did. Two major reform proposals emerged in the Senate. First came Feinstein’s introduction of a bill to ban 157 named civilian versions of assault rifles similar to the 1994-2004 ban on such weapons that she and then-Sen. Biden had initiated. This was followed by the expanded background check proposal put together under the guidance of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and Republican Pat Toomey. Both bills failed. The assault weapon ban needed 60 votes to get around the filibuster. It only got 40, with 15 Democrats voting against it. The background check expansion did better, but it only picked up 54 votes, six short of what was needed. Five Democrats voted against it. All five of those Democrats have since left the Senate, four of them replaced by Republicans. Six of the 15 Democrats who voted against the assault weapons ban are still in the Senate, the other nine having also been replaced by Republicans. Even if Democrats managed to keep all the Senate seats they now have and win seats against all the vulnerable Republicans, they still would not have enough votes to overcome a filibuster. But the nationwide popularity of background checks might push enough Republicans to join Democrats and pass such a bill. If Democrats were to decide to dump the filibuster, then victory for an expansion of background checks could be all but assured. But other proposals would face stiff resistance. Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke has proposed the strictest change—a confiscatory plan to ban both new sales of semi-automatic assault weapons and a government buyback of all such weapons now in private hands. After a mass shooting took the lives of 35 people in 1996, the confiscation of semi-autos, mandatory licensing of gun owners, and registration of firearms worked in Australia to reduce the number of mass killings there and accelerated the steady fall in homicides that had begun before the law was passed. All in all more than 700,000 firearms were voluntarily surrendered or sold in the buyback program, reportedly reducing the total number of firearms in Australia by 20%. After the mosque was shot up and 51 people killed earlier this year in New Zealand, the parliament there moved quickly to impose a ban and confiscatory buy back program of semi-autos. Since the program began in mid-July, 19,000 people had by November 2 turned in 32,000 firearms for which the government paid $62 million. At that rate, 50,000 weapons will have been bought back by the December 20 deadline. Estimates of the number of semi-autos in New Zealand run to as high as 175,000, so that would be a 29% compliance rate. How law enforcement will go about collecting the banned firearms that aren’t being turned in has yet to be decided. In the United States, under the broad definition that eight states use, the number of weapons that could be classified as assault rifles is unknown. One analysis puts the number at somewhere between 15 and 20 million, with one to two million more being manufactured each year. The range in that estimate illustrates how difficult it would be to implement such a proposal. If a proposal like O’Rourke’s were passed, it would inevitably mean a lot of door-to-door visits by law enforcement, something most police will not be eager to undertake for obvious reasons. While a recent Civiqs poll showed 49% of Americans in support of a ban on sales of semi-auto assault weapons (with 44% opposed), short of taking away all firearms, it’s hard to imagine any proposal that would energize gun rights advocates more than O’Rourke’s confiscation. For that reason and all the others that have been raised objecting to the less-strict bans like Feinstein’s, chances that such a bill would clear even a heavily Democratic House and Senate are just about nil. Biden’s proposal seems quite benign by comparison. Although he favors a ban on new sales of assault weapons, in place of confiscation he proposes a choice for their existing owners: either sell these firearms to the government or register just as owners of automatic weapons must register their guns under the National Firearms Act. But what seems like an entirely reasonable proposal to some people wouldn’t be viewed that way by others. One loud complaint raised by gun rights advocates before the vote in 2013 was that keeping permanent records of gun transactions—as some reformers had proposed at the time—would make it easy for future politicians to use the list to guide a broad confiscation. It’s unlikely that their objections will have melted away in seven years. Serious legislation short of confiscation means licensing gun owners and permanently registering all firearms. However, it’s doubtful that anything even hinting of that is coming anytime soon despite the current vigor of the various elements of the gun law reform movement. But that day will come.",2019-11-29 15:00:10,"Many Dems no longer fear gun law reform, but even with a Senate majority, it will be a steep climb","politics and government,law and legislation,armament, defense and military forces,gun control,firearms",115,http://www.dailykos.com

This is not surprising, considering that the NRA is technically a nonprofit organization. But some people are wondering about the Second Amendment cheerleaders’ choices to hold a gun raffle in a Kentucky high school gym. The Washington Post reports that Muhlenberg County High School in Greenville, Kentucky, was the site of a September NRA gun raffle that included handguns, semiautomatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and guns with high-capacity magazine capability. All things you usually learn about after a mass shooting in a high school. According to the report, this was the first time in the last three years that the NRA didn’t actually display real guns along the bleachers during the raffle, opting under pressure from parents, to only show printed images of the guns. A parent from the school told the Post she thought it was “obscene,” and had not realized that this kind of NRA gun raffle was going on in schools across the country. A grandmother of one of the students at the school said the whole thing made no sense: “They are selling guns on school property. Where we have active-shooter drills.” The NRA told the Post that NRA fundraisers on school grounds are a small fraction of their fundraising efforts and usually done as philanthropic endeavors. Explaining that the schools appreciate the “supplement” to their “limited budgets.” Of course, the fact that schools are underfunded for extra curricular activities and enrichment programs is a problem no one should have to fundraise for. You can see some images of the event on the Friends of the NRA-Paradise Committee, Kentucky Facebook page. The NRA has been facing internal lawsuits, investigations into their accounting, and clear financial issues. After years of toothless regulations on their products and lazy regulations on their ability to fundraise off those products, questions have begun to get asked. The standard refrain of Second Amendment chanting no longer holds the same immunity it once did for legislators, as the public has become sick and tired of worthless political hacks and the blood money the NRA puts into school teams and law enforcement. The Second Amendment cult in our country has one fundamental flaw at its root: they believe that guns can solve the issues that guns and economic inequality create. Whether trying to get guns allowed onto grade school parking lots, or trying to press teachers—most of whom have zero interest in carrying a gun on school grounds—to bring guns to school, the NRA and its shills are singleminded in their pursuit. The NRA and similar groups make money off of guns and the culture related to guns. They will bring those guns anywhere they believe they can make a buck.

429,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1898922,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an appeal from the Remington Arms Company to review a lower court’s ruling that allowed families of Sandy Hook victims, and one survivor, to sue the gunmaker. Specifically, the court allowed the Sandy Hook families to move forward in a lawsuit over how Remington marketed the Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle which was ultimately used to kill 20 first-graders and six adults in the 2012 massacre. This decision is a big deal—a federal law has protected gun companies from similar lawsuits since 2005. By denying the gunmaker’s bid, and tossing the case back down to the Connecticut Superior Court, families are one step closer to justice. In simple terms, the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act protects manufacturers and sellers from liability when their firearms and ammunition are later used in crimes. This law, which is incredibly broad, is one of the main reasons families of victims have struggled to hold gun makers accountable in court. The law has some exceptions—like if the manufacturer knowingly violated the law when marketing the item, or even if the firearm was defective and caused a death because of its defect. But flatout saying this weapon was used in a mass shooting, historically, hasn’t cut it. One of those exceptions is particularly important in the Sandy Hook case. Nine family members of victims, in addition to one survivor of the shooting, argue that this federal law that typically protects the company under such circumstances doesn’t apply because the gunmaker violated state laws (specifically the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act) when it was marketing the weapon. Families involved in the case argue that Remington ""published promotional materials that promised 'military-proven performance' for a 'mission-adaptable' shooter in need of the 'ultimate combat weapons system,'"" as found in filings with the U.S. Supreme Court. Basically: This rifle shouldn’t be used by civilians, and the company illegally marketed it by highlighting its use to the general public. This case doesn’t involve the Second Amendment explicitly, though for obvious reason the NRA has backed Remington, even going as far as to call the lawsuit “company-killing.” In 2018, Remington did, indeed, file for bankruptcy. “The families are grateful that the Supreme Court upheld precedent and denied Remington’s latest attempt to avoid accountability,” the attorney representing the families, Josh Koskoff, said in a statement. “We are ready to resume discovery and proceed towards trial in order to shed light on Remington’s profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users at the expense of Americans’ safety.” To be clear: This SCOTUS development doesn’t mean the Sandy Hook families will win. It’s not a guarantee. But it allows the case to actually proceed, which is a victory in itself. The justices did not provide any comments on the case.

Hanukkah moves around on its own relative to the Gregorian calendar each year so I’m fuzzier on its creep capacity. Anyway, with winter holiday music and paraphernalia hitting airwaves and stores and homes and lawns earlier (it seems, but also my sense of time has become super warped since Trump took office) each year, we’re also confronted with the earlier advent of another essential seasonal tradition. I mean, you can’t have Christmas creep without War on Christmas creep. Time of the Season: Because Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin must lie awake at night thinking of ways to annoy their Democratic governor, the latest controversy in the Badger State is centered on what to call the capitol’s seasonal tree. Cue the histrionics. But forget about the loser who doesn't matter. Because everyone knows that guns don’t kill people. Holiday trees kill people. Too Much Time On My Hands: While we’re in this neck of the woods, let’s check in on Michigan, where GOP legislative majorities are, like their Wisconsin neighbors, mad about having a Democratic governor for the first time in eight years. Sure, Jan. But this isn’t all Shirkey’s been up to recently. Weird, Republicans didn’t seem to mind a Republican governor having and using this power for the past eight years. Time Is On My Side: As an erudite reader of this missive (or perhaps just as someone who hasn’t been living under a rock for the past week or so), you know that Democrats succeeded in winning legislative majorities in both the Virginia House and Senate last week for the first time since the mid-1990s. But get this: Virginia Republicans could wreak still more havoc before the new Democratic majorities are sworn in in January. If I Could Turn Back Time: Let’s wrap on something upbeat. Ish. Upbeatish. Because while the resolution is positive, it took North Carolina Republicans waaaaaaaaaay too long to get here. Forty years, in fact. Because it took until 2019 for the Tar Heel State to finally outlaw rape. You read that right. Welp, that’s it for this week. I think it’s time for you to knock off, get an early start on your weekend. I bet it’s been The Longest Time since you relaxed. Just Let The Good Times Roll.

431,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1899640,"At the very moment news broke Thursday of a school shooting in Santa Clarita, California, Sen. Chris Murphy was on the Senate floor making a motion to force a vote on universal background checks for gun purchases. Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith blocked that motion. ""We can't go 24 hours without news of another mass shooting somewhere in America. My kids and millions' others hide in corners of their classroom or in their bathrooms preparing for a mass shooting at their school, and this body does nothing about it,"" said Murphy. His home state of Connecticut saw a horrifying school shooting in Newtown, at Sandy Hook Elementary. Hyde-Smith said that the bill shouldn't be voted on before it was considered in committee. ""Legislation that would affect the rights of American citizens under the Second Amendment should not be fast tracked by the Senate,"" she said. Which would be a valid point if Mitch McConnell had not shut down the legislative process for anything but judges and the bare minimum of business for government to function. ""I can't get a piece of legislation to the floor in any other way other than to offer this motion,"" Murphy countered. ""And the American public are not going to accept silence from this body week after week, month after month, in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening across this country."" McConnell might be forced to answer to the will of the people if Donald Trump were intent on following through on his promise to act. He's not, and he and his consigliere, Attorney General William Barr, have cooked up a particularly pernicious excuse: impeachment. On Wednesday, Barr was at an event in Memphis, where he said, ""Our discussions on the legislative aspects of this have been sidetracked because of the impeachment process on the Hill, and so we are going forward with all the operational steps that we can take that do not require legislative action. […] Right now it does not appear that things in Washington are amenable to those kinds of negotiations and compromises."" Never mind that Trump called for ""meaningful"" movement on background checks months ago, after the horrible weekend of double mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. Long before impeachment was seriously discussed, long before impeachment proceedings began. The legislative work on this could have been completed easily by now, if Republicans—if Trump—had any intention of making it happen. Here's the reality, from reporting in The Washington Post: ""Trump has been counseled by political advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that gun legislation could splinter his political coalition, which he needs to stick together for his reelection bid, particularly amid an impeachment battle.""

432,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/what-virginias-election-results-mean-2020/601501/?utm_source=feed,"Virginia has been a bellwether in the Trump era, and Democrats hope their historic victory last night points to another national win in 2020. The full consequences of the Democratic Party’s victory last night in Virginia won’t become apparent for months or even years to come. By winning both houses of the state legislature, Democrats have turned the state totally blue for the first time in 26 years. They’ll have a chance to pass major new gun laws in the backyard of the Fairfax-based National Rifle Association, to more than double Virginia’s minimum wage, and to solidify their electoral gains by reversing Republican gerrymanders through redistricting two years from now. But the more immediate significance of the results is what they portend for the Democrats’ much bigger battle ahead: They show that the electoral fire on the left sparked by Donald Trump’s stunning victory in 2016 is still burning hot three years later. In 2017, Virginia was a proving ground for Democrats as they tried to translate the energy of the so-called Resistance into electoral victory. They won three statewide elections that year and dramatically exceeded expectations in legislative races, foreshadowing the party’s national triumph in recapturing the House majority in 2018. They hope the same trend will hold true heading into 2020. “This historic victory should send a chill down the spines of Donald Trump and every Republican,” proclaimed Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement. “Democrats are competing in every election and every state, running on our values, and channelling unprecedented energy into the voting booth—that’s how we won tonight, that’s how we’ll beat Trump in one year, and that’s how Democrats will win victories at every level in 2020.” It was a statement full of braggadocio, to be sure, but in Virginia, in Kentucky, and in key elections in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Democrats had the numbers to back it up. Turnout surged in big Virginia counties, just as it did in the areas around Louisville, Lexington, and south of Cincinnati, where the Democrat Andy Beshear was able to rack up the votes he needed for an apparent upset victory over the incumbent Republican governor, Matt Bevin. There were no statewide races in Virginia this year—it’s what insiders there refer to as the “off-off-year election.” But as I wrote last month, you’d never know that from watching television. With Democrats needing to flip just two seats in each legislative chamber to secure outright majorities, national progressive groups poured millions of dollars into the state, resulting in wall-to-wall ads from Labor Day on. Turnout in these legislative races has hovered around 30 percent in recent years. The state hasn’t released full turnout information from last night, but data from the largest counties, where Democrats scored their biggest wins, indicate it was close to, and in some cases more than, 40 percent. That would represent the biggest “off-off-year” turnout in more than 20 years and rival the number of votes recorded in the statewide races in 2013 and the midterm elections a year later. Read: The blue wave faces its first test after 2018 Just as in 2018, Democrats’ strength did not extend everywhere, and the overall higher turnout levels of the Trump era include rural areas where the president is inspiring his own supporters to show up for Republicans at the polls. While Democrats appear to have won the governorship in Kentucky, the GOP easily won the five other statewide races on the ballot. In Mississippi, Democrats fielded a strong gubernatorial candidate in Attorney General Jim Hood, but he could not overcome the state’s deep-red lean and lost by six points to Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, who had Trump’s backing. Turnout there did not measure up to Virginia or Kentucky. And in New Jersey, Republicans appear to have gained seats in the state legislature, including in the southern part of the state where Democrats ousted GOP House incumbents last year. Yet Virginia was where the most was at stake for Democrats nationally. The party had renewed its efforts to flip statehouses in the aftermath of Trump’s 2016 win after years of largely ceding them to Republicans. With GOP lawmakers blocking efforts at gun control following another mass shooting in Virginia Beach over the summer, groups such as Everytown added millions of dollars in spending as they fought a proxy battle with the NRA. Democrats had to overcome scandals that politically neutralized statewide leaders Governor Ralph Northam, who denied he was pictured in a blackface yearbook photo that emerged earlier this year, and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who faced accusations of sexual assault from multiple women. Both men refused demands that they resign from virtually the entire Democratic Party in Virginia. “Obviously the Democratic Party had a rough start to the year,” the state party’s executive director, Chris Bolling, conceded in a call with reporters this morning. Read: The furor in Virginia has quieted By the fall, however, voters seemed to have moved on. Northam’s approval ratings rebounded, and GOP efforts to tie Democratic legislative candidates to the disgraced party leaders largely fell flat. The bigger question became whether the party could sustain the enthusiasm that had fueled its victories in 2017 and 2018. Expectations were much higher: Whereas two years ago, Democrats were happy merely to hold the governorship and make gains in the legislature, this year nothing short of outright majorities in both the state Senate and House of Delegates would count as a win. The same is true for the party nationally in 2020. Democrats will have to overcome whatever fights break out in their presidential primary and keep up their energy in driving turnout in the cities and suburbs to match Trump’s strength among cultural conservatives and rural voters. If Virginia turns out to be the bellwether Democrats hope it is—and which it proved to be two years ago—then last night’s results were a very good sign for the party.",2019-11-06 11:30:43,The Blue Wave Never Ended in Virginia,"politics and government,elections,governors (us),election results,legislatures and parliaments",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
433,https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/11/newtown-mourns-sandy-hook-every-autumn/602677/?utm_source=feed,"The weeks between Halloween and December 14, the anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, are heavy with memory for the entire community. Seven years ago, in Newtown, Connecticut, Halloween was canceled. We were working to dig ourselves out of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, finding detours through a maze of roads closed by downed trees, keeping kids busy through a full week of “storm day” school closings, and improvising meals on hot plates as we waited for full power to return. Newtown normally hosts Halloween along its lovely downtown thoroughfare of colonial-era meetinghouses, churches, and historic homes, all radiating from “the flagpole,” the landmark that pulls us all together, the center of things. The homeowners go all out decorating their facades, and welcome all comers. The Episcopal church hosts a pumpkin-carving contest that runs the week before, and on Halloween night, scores of carved jack-o’-lanterns light up the corner of Main Street and Church Hill Road. But in 2012, all of this was canceled. My family was a few minutes’ drive from the flagpole then, in a rented house in the village of Sandy Hook. We’d just moved to town a few months earlier. In those early days, our sense of living in a small town was shaped by leaving behind a larger landscape of freeways and rivers; coming from Charleston, South Carolina, we were used to referring to ourselves as living outside the expressway. In Newtown, our kids spent a lot less time in the car, and by Halloween, more than a week into the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, we’d fallen deep into the easy community of the place. None of our neighbors had any power, and we were working together, with generators, to save the contents of our fridges and ration warm-shower time. That Halloween night, rather than heading up to Main Street, our hearty band of neighbor kids went trick-or-treating around our neighborhood. My son Willem, then in the fourth grade, had a new familiarity with the neighborhood after notifying neighbors about an upcoming food drive, his citizenship project at school. So he led a band of smaller kids up the mostly dark lanes and driveways. Less than a week later, the lights back on but the night brutally cold, Main Street held its trick or treat. Willem and my husband made it all the way down Main Street; my younger son, Luke, and I made it halfway down the block, then retreated to the warmth of the car. That was November 4. Since then, almost all of my friends have told me about that night. I’ve heard where they were and how long they lasted in the new cold that signaled the end of fall and the coming of winter. Almost everyone I know remembers that night really well. That trick-or-treat night, for so many in Newtown, was the last public moment of celebration before we would find ourselves inside an aftermath that lasted longer and hit harder than a hurricane’s, one we’re still experiencing. Talk of that cold Halloween night in Newtown leads inevitably to talk of a brisk sunny morning five weeks later when 20 first graders and six educators were murdered by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Now each Halloween marks the beginning of a new “season.” Not the holidays, but the season that comprises the weeks from October 31, when, seven years ago, Newtown was emerging from a deluge, and December 14, the date none of us is ever fully prepared to see again, even as the years pass. Read: The forever aftermath of a mass shooting In those weeks between Halloween and the anniversary of the tragedy, even from my own distance from the events of that day, I find it hard to stand up, hard to go on. The weather changes, the trees go bare. In spring and summer, the grocery store is the site of lingering chat sessions with moms I run into, their kids in soccer uniforms fresh from the pitch, or headed to dance practice or theater rehearsal. In these weeks, I trudge up the aisle with my head down. When I do look up, I can see it on everyone’s faces: We are trying to show up for one another and especially for those in our town who are experiencing so much worse, but the days and the light have gotten shorter, and we feel anew the coming dark. Some years I can manage to get to the annual tree lighting in early December at the Ram’s Pasture, a classic New England green. Other years I can’t face it. The impulse in this season of mourning is to stay home, close the curtains, and withdraw. The Saturday morning that dawned after the day of the shooting, December 15, 2012, was the deadline Willem had set to collect those food-drive donations for his citizenship project; on the flyer he’d distributed that stormy Halloween week, he’d told neighbors to expect him that morning. The day before, he’d endured an hours-long lockdown at his school (not Sandy Hook, but nearby Hawley Elementary), until parents came to claim their children. On the way home, I told him the barest of details about what had happened. Now President Barack Obama was on his way to Newtown. The names of those killed had just been released. People all over town were mobilizing meal trains, babysitting—all kinds of support for those directly affected. The funerals would start that week and run for several consecutive days. I explained to Willem that many of our neighbors would be learning that their friends had been killed the day before, and maybe we shouldn’t knock on their doors. His teacher would understand. But he wanted to go, and we decided to try a few houses just to see. People answered their doors with donations in hand, expecting him—happy, somehow, to see him. In a photo of him from that day, the donations cover our kitchen table and spill onto the floor. I have some pictures of him from that following spring as well—in his basketball uniform, at the picnic the PTA threw as he finished the fourth grade and then began a new school year. In fifth grade, the four elementary schools in Newtown integrate into one student body at Reed Intermediate School. That year my son’s world expanded to include friends not just from Hawley but from Sandy Hook, Head of Meadow, and Middlegate. He started fifth grade aware that a quarter of his classmates had been inside Sandy Hook during the shooting. Every class period that year was an exercise in bridging the distances between those who’d lost loved ones, and those who’d been inside the school, and those who’d been nearby yet not close enough to ever fully understand. Those distances will never close, but it’s important to reach across them. Sometime in the first fall following the shooting, during those brisk weeks after Halloween, I was at a small house party. It was a leaf-raking and campfire party, the kind of party you can have in a town full of blazing maples and elms. I ended up alone in the living room with a friend of mine who had lost a child in the shooting. It was dark, our children were outside, and we were waiting for the host to return with party pizza—a specially sized two-foot rectangle of pizza from a local restaurant that is the modern equivalent of loaves and fishes. My friend was asking about Luke, now a first grader. Who was Luke’s teacher? What was he into? Out the window, some of the heartiest leaves still clung to their branches. I saw my friend’s surviving child, older and taller than Luke, walk up to him to point out a constellation as we stood in the picture window watching them. I saw Luke trace the trajectory and then find the constellation. For a second I feared my knees would give out under the crushing pain and beauty of the moment. But then I thought, if my friend can stand here, then I damn well better figure out how to stand too. Every fall as the new school year approaches, I become aware that the season of mourning is on its way. The Newtown Bee posts the school-bus schedules, and as I page my way through, I can’t help but remember those weeks after the tragedy, when putting a child on a school bus felt like an almost impossible act of faith. Some of our friends and neighbors last saw their children when putting them on these very buses, and we will never be certain again that our own children will return on these buses each afternoon. Every year on December 14, a lone trumpeter plays at the front door of the Episcopal church at the start of an interfaith service. The jack-o’-lanterns are gone by then. He stands out there alone, no matter the weather. Someone told me he drives each year from Montreal to share this one act of community with us; I’m not sure if that’s true, but I know that he doesn’t live in Newtown. I’ve only overheard him speak a few phrases in French, and he’s careful to leave us alone in the sanctuary. But he’s there. Over these past seven autumns, I’ve learned that just showing up for neighbors during these difficult weeks between Halloween and December 14 can help lift at least some of the weight we carry. The isolation of a family’s loss never goes away, but that doesn’t mean they have to mourn alone. I’ve seen the citizens of Newtown show up for one another in many ways—some have taken to the steps of the Supreme Court, to the voting booth, or to Congress. Others practice smaller, almost private acts of devotion: a bugle on the steps of a church, or food set aside for the boy who’s coming bright and early to collect it in the morning.",2019-11-27 09:24:12,Mourning Season in Newtown,"hurricanes and tropical storms,holidays and special occasions,travel and vacations,housing",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
434,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/1900318,"Voters in Virginia this year told pollsters again and again that their top issue was gun safety. They voted on it, and the NRA—headquartered in Virginia—lost big—as did the Republicans that ran the legislature on behalf of the NRA. Take a special session of the Legislature that Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam called in July to answer the May 31 mass shooting in Virginia Beach, in which 12 people were killed. Here's how Mother Jones reported on what happened the day the session opened: ""NRA officials turned the Republican House speaker's conference room into a de facto war room, distributing hundreds of hats and T-shirts to the gun rights supporters who showed up at the Capitol. Some were packing heat; several donned full tactical gear and toted assault rifles as they milled about under the summer sun."" The Republican majority adjourned the special session after just 90 minutes, without considering a single bill. That moment was the catalyst for those Republicans' defeat at the ballot box, and for the first time in a quarter of a century, Democrats now control the Legislature and the governor's office, and the NRA is out. By refusing to give an inch on sensible gun reform in an epidemic of gun violence, it’s destroyed its appeal to the key group it’s counted on to keep electing gun-friendly lawmakers—suburban voters. “What you saw in Virginia was really a trend that had been visible in 2017 and 2018,” Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, told Mother Jones. ""President Trump is really unpopular in the suburbs, and that motivates a lot of Democrats to turn out."" Trump motivates big Democratic turnout, but it's the Republican voters turning that has Republicans and the NRA worried, as gun safety becomes more and more of a bipartisan issue. ""It used to be that Democrats wouldn't talk about gun control outside of the most blue urban districts,"" Farnsworth said, but not anymore. A key flip was the 40th District of the House of Delegates, where Rep. Tim Hugo was the last long-serving Republican in the Northern Virginia suburbs. Democrat Dan Helmer, an Army veteran who ran on gun issues, won that seat by 6 points. Even before the Virginia Beach shooting, he said that gun safety was ""overwhelmingly"" the issue voters brought up with him. ""More Virginians die of gun violence each year than die in car accidents, which, if you think of the number of firearms and then the number of cars, is mad,"" he said. His experience is echoed in Civiqs polling from this summer that found even 77% of Republicans support expanded background checks. Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, the gun safety group co-founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, is looking ahead to 2020 and the changing landscape on the issue in the all-important suburbs. ""I'm not going to tell you Democrats will end up with control of Texas in the next year and a half,"" Ambler said, ""but what you will see in states like Texas … is the same type of shift that you've seen in Virginia for the past few years.""

Beto O’Rourke is dropping out of the 2020 Democratic presidential race. O’Rourke launched his campaign to great fanfare following an unsuccessful — but competitive — campaign to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). He burst onto the scene of the 2020 primary declaring he was “just born to be in it” and subsequently raised $6.1 million in his first day of fundraising. Some early supporters characterized him as “Barack Obama, but white.” “My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,” he wrote in a Medium post, explaining that he chose to leave the race because he does not have “the means to move forward successfully.” O’Rourke’s campaign has stagnated, struggling with fundraising and polling. O’Rourke raised just $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the $24.6 million raised by Warren and the $25.3 million raised by Sanders. Unlike some of his rivals, O’Rourke made it onto every Democratic debate stage so far but sometimes did so by slim margins. He had not yet met the criteria to participate in the next two debates and averaged around 3 percent for much of the year, according to RealClearPolitics’ polling average. The former lawmaker stood out on the debate stage by addressing the audience in Spanish and by making gun reform his signature issue; it was a policy position he took ownership of following a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, and one that led to his rallying cry, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15!” That call was the summation of O’Rourke’s proposal to buy back assault weapons currently in Americans’ hands and to ban the sale of new ones. As a candidate, the lawmaker was criticized by some of his rivals, most notably South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for not having fully developed all of the details of how a buyback plan and ban would work, with Buttigieg casting it as a fanciful “purity test.” Other candidates, however, have praised O’Rourke’s leadership on the issue. “I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He’s done a great job with that,” fellow Texan Julián Castro said at one debate. And he was praised by his rivals upon his exit. “Beto has inspired millions of Americans all over our country, and rallied Texans and El Pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown,” Castro wrote on Twitter. “Thank you,” Warren wrote. “Your commitment to ending gun violence and uplifting the voices of the victims and their families has made this presidential race — and our country — stronger.” Ultimately, O’Rourke’s early momentum proved to be not quite enough to sustain him. He argued for unity in his announcement, asking his followers to back whoever does become the nominee. “We must support them in the race against Donald Trump and support them in their administration afterwards, do all that we can to help them heal a wounded country and bring us together in meeting the greatest set of challenges we have ever known,” O’Rourke wrote. O’Rourke’s presidential campaign started on a high: Almost beating Cruz in Texas awarded him a flurry of positive press, a seat on Oprah Winfrey’s couch, and comparisons to Obama and even Abraham Lincoln. But what made him stand out in the Senate race — the ability to use a charismatic, tell-it-how-you-see-it retail politic to come within two points of Cruz — quickly faltered on the national stage. Soon after announcing his candidacy, the influx of dozens of other candidates, many more high profile than himself, with longer track records and better name recognition, the calls began for O’Rourke to drop out of the presidential race and run for Senate instead. O’Rourke immediately and repeatedly ruled out the possibility. “I will not in any scenario run for the United States Senate,” O’Rourke told MSNBC in August, resolute in his run for the presidency. But the calls haven’t stopped. After all, O’Rourke made Democrats believe winning statewide in Texas was possible; he ran the closest statewide race in the state since the 1970s. And Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who is up for reelection, is less popular in the state than Cruz was. In June, 60 percent of Texas Democrats told a Quinnipiac University poll that they’d preferred to see O’Rourke in the Senate race. And in a head-to-head poll, O’Rourke was just 2 points behind incumbent Cornyn. There’s no reason to suspect O’Rourke will flip on his past remarks and run for the Senate now. In fact, one of O’Rourke’s aides, Rob Friedlander, told the New York Times Friday, “Beto will not be a candidate for US Senate in Texas in 2020.” And O’Rourke himself told Politico in October, “I cannot fathom a scenario where I would run for public office again if I’m not the nominee.” That said, former Colorado governor and failed presidential candidate John Hickenlooper also said he wouldn’t run for Senate and he’s now leading the Democratic primary for Colorado’s Senate race.

After 20 years of Democrats being out of power in the Virginia House of Delegates, a blue wave has swept the state capitol in Richmond. Democrats pulled off a major win on Tuesday night, taking both the state House and state Senate. This ensures a trifecta: Democrats will have a majority in both legislative chambers, and the party is led in the state by Gov. Ralph Northam. Decision Desk called both races as of 9:30 pm Tuesday. Tuesday’s elections were further evidence that once-purple Virginia is trending more and more solidly blue. Republicans have not won a statewide political office since 2009, but had hung onto power in the state legislature in part due to past redistricting that a court deemed a racial gerrymander. (The court ordered districts redrawn ahead of the 2019 election.) Related It’s also evidence that Democrats are fired up and organized even on the state level. In the run-up to the 2019 elections, some grassroots activists told Vox they were seeing major enthusiasm, even for an off-year election where the biggest races on the ballot were for state lawmakers, instead of a governor’s or US Senate race. That could bode well for Democrats ahead of an all-important presidential election year. Beyond the political implications for both Democrats and Republicans, tonight’s win also has some major policy consequences. Republicans in the House of Delegates had typically served as the stopping point for any Democratic legislation on a number of issues, including getting rid of right-to-work laws, raising the minimum wage, and passing gun safety provisions. Even though Virginia passed Medicaid expansion last year when a handful of Republicans decided to support the bill, health care still ranks as a top issue for many Virginia voters — and the new majorities could bring sweeping changes. Voters are still frustrated with the high cost of prescription drugs, and Democrats want their new majorities to fight back against Republican bills that would allow insurers to not cover those with preexisting conditions. “They’re still feeling like there’s a heavy expense for prescription drugs, and they want to know how you’re going to try to get some of these costs down,” Virginia state Delegate Lashrecse Aird (D), who represents a predominantly minority district, recently told Vox about her constituents’ concerns. Another huge issue that has come up both in Aird’s community as well as around the state is the issue of gun violence. In June, Northam called a special legislative session to address gun violence after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach claimed the lives of 12 people. Ultimately, the session didn’t yield any progress; Republicans adjourned it after just 90 minutes, without taking up a single bill. Now that his party controls the legislature, Northam may be encouraged to try again. Democrats statewide are also eyeing a laundry list of other priorities that have been blocked by Republicans in the past, including raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and passing a state Equal Rights Amendment that would give civil rights protections to LGBTQ individuals. Tuesday’s election just paved the way for some of those ideas to potentially become law. Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

A group of alt-right and “dissident right” activists have joined forces with neo-Nazis and others on the far-right fringes to attack conservatives who they feel aren’t true conservatives, both online and in person. Sunday, for instance, members of this group heckled Donald Trump Jr. at an event in California. And conservative speakers have been beset by the “groypers” at events in Texas, Tennessee and Arizona as well. This group, which calls itself the “groyper army” — “groyper” being a reference to a meme of Pepe the Frog, itself a meme overtaken by the alt-right — purports to be supporting “traditional values” within conservatism, like immigration restrictionism. And it argues that relatively mainstream conservative student groups like Turning Point USA need to be confronted because they are shutting down “socially conservative Christians and supporters of President Trump’s agenda” and promoting “degeneracy” by having gay speakers. This “groyper army” targets what it has termed “Conservative Inc,” a collective epitomized by conservative speakers like pundit Ben Shapiro, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, conservative writer Jonah Goldberg, and even Trump Jr., as well as conservative student organizations including Turning Point USA and Young Americans for Freedom. Beyond the sort of heckling Trump faced, the network’s tactics usually focus on asking speakers specific and very leading questions about Israel, immigration, and LGBTQ issues within conservatism, hoping to elicit answers that reveal the speaker’s “fake conservatism.” “Real conservatism” being defined essentially as an emphasis on ethnic and racial characteristics as determinants for immigration coupled with an isolationist foreign policy and a “traditional” stance on LGBTQ issues. These tactics have gotten support from some mainstream right-leaning pundits who advocate for extreme restrictions on immigration, like Michelle Malkin. In reality, the “groyper army” is simply the alt-right of 2016 and 2017, warmed over, reenergized and using new terminology aimed at disassociating itself from the “optics” problem caused by the tremendous failure of 2017’s Unite the Right Rally, which ended in the murder of a young woman. Its leaders and advocates are racists and Holocaust deniers, its message boards wax rhapsodic about the man who perpetrated the Christchurch mass shooting, and the questions it presents to conservative speakers are based on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and “white genocide” fears. As one source told me after a Turning Point USA event beset by “groypers,” “I did not know there were this many racists out there.” Over the weekend, the “groyper army” targeted Turning Point USA events, one featuring Donald Trump Jr. at UCLA and another featuring Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) at Arizona State. Audience: We want to ask questionsTPUSA: Have sex incelThis will end well. pic.twitter.com/DrXlVyjIsk According to a source, the former event was intended to be a brief interview conducted by Kirk, followed by a book signing of Trump Jr.’s new book Triggered. But the groyper army, which made up roughly a third of the audience, overwhelmed Trump, Jr. and Trump campaign senior adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, screaming loudly and demanding a Q&A session (The video above was from the Twitter account of a “groyper army” supporter.) Rep. Dan Crenshaw was another target of the groyper army this weekend. At an event at Arizona State titled “Prove Me Wrong ft. Congressman Dan Crenshaw,” at which Crenshaw answered questions from an audience, Crenshaw was asked a series of questions which he later told me by email were “almost exclusively about Israel.” Crenshaw is at ASU and right away:- TPUSA formed two lines for Q&A (contentious vs non)- calls questioner antiemetic- insists we are not conservatives#CutureWar pic.twitter.com/SZHvIMC8TQ “The basic nature of their questions was to ask a question that at first seems like a legitimate policy difference, perfectly debatable,” Crenshaw told me. “But what then becomes clear — and there are hints along the way — the motivations are deeper and darker than their original question indicated.” One of those questions is centered on the USS Liberty. As BuzzFeed News reporter Ellie Hall detailed in 2018: The USS Liberty is a dog whistle referring to an incident in 1967 where Israeli forces fired on the US spy ship, killing 34, during the Six-Day War. In the aftermath, Israel said that its pilots had thought the ship was an Egyptian vessel, and apologized — the government eventually paid out $6.7 million in reparations to the survivors and families of the dead. Ever since, there have been unproven conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances that question whether the attack was intentional. Both the Israeli and the United States governments have said that it was a case of mistaken identity. The USS Liberty has now become an anti-Semitic meme, used to argue that the Israeli government is actually an enemy of the United States and that the country should not be receiving American funding. And members of the groyper army have been urged online to ask TPUSA speakers about the USS Liberty and other anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, like that of the “dancing Israelis,” which alleges that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks and five Israeli nationals “danced” in celebration while watching them. They ask these questions with the hopes of creating viral content of the responses like this video, of an October 21 Turning Point USA event at Grand Canyon University. According to the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, countering speakers by simply shouting out specific conspiracy theories is good enough. It urges readers who attend Turning Point USA events who fail in their attempts to ask questions, “When you get pulled out [by security], yell “GOOGLE THE USS LIBERTY” or “GOOGLE DANCING ISRAELIS” or “AMERICA FIRST NOT ISRAEL FIRST” or just “NICK FUENTES.” The groyper army is led in part, or at least symbolically, by Nick Fuentes, a 22-year-old former conservative radio host and Unite the Right attendee who hosts a YouTube show called “America First.” A former ally of white nationalist Richard Spencer and a friend of white nationalists like Patrick Casey and Vincent Foxx, Fuentes has attempted to obfuscate his views by arguing on the messaging service Telegram that “America First” is a “traditionalist, Christian, conservative, reformist, American Nationalist” movement while the alt-right was “racialist” and “transnational.” But this is pure semantics, as Fuentes is a white nationalist and an avowed anti-Semite who referred to Daily Wire writer Matt Walsh as a “shabbos goy race traitor” for condemning the El Paso, Texas, gunman who killed more than 20 people in August. In fact, in an interview with a French Canadian white nationalist, Fuentes said that the only reason he didn’t call himself a white nationalist is because “that kind of terminology is used almost exclusively by the left to defame.” “I think in a way it’s almost redundant that you’re a ‘white’ nationalist. We know that the word ‘nation’ almost implicitly talks about ethnicity and biology,” Fuentes said. In a series of videos deleted from his YouTube account in late October, Fuentes argues (using a thinly veiled metaphor referring to black Americans as “blackboards” and white Americans as “whiteboards”) that “America First is not America First if it’s not 100 percent whiteboard” and that he’s a “whiteboard nationalist.” In another video, he advocates for segregation and Jim Crow, arguing “even if it was bad, who cares?” He has also described one of the Koch brothers as “an enemy of the white race” and his reaction to the El Paso shooting was to say, “the easiest way for Mexicans to not get shot in Wal-Mart is to not fucking be here.” In September, Turning Point USA — which has faced allegations of racist behavior previously —  cut ties with a brand ambassador, Ashley St. Clair, who was photographed with Fuentes, and in October, Fuentes was prevented from accessing an event at Politicon, the annual non-partisan political conference, that featured Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. A source told me that it was the organization’s decision to cut ties with St. Clair that led to Fuentes’s fight with the organization, and to a host of resignations from chapters from members more aligned with Fuentes’s world view. In fact, a source told me that Turning Point USA decided to dissolve one chapter of the organization, at Kansas State University, saying, “Turning Point has a very specific big tent message” that Fuentes and his followers are not a part of. He said that the organization largely greeted the resignations with “don’t let the door hit you.” But he added that Fuentes isn’t trying to take down just Turning Point USA: “He wants to burn down Conservative Inc.” The fight over the groyper army is not just about college campuses. It’s about the future of conservatism, and what that future should look like as the groyper army attempts to make itself, as Ben Shapiro put it in a speech focused on the alt-right last week, the “heirs of conservatism.” And yes, that future begins in college. College campuses have long been where conservative groups and conservative concepts get their start, from Young Americans for Freedom and the Sharon Statement in the 1960s to the “trigger the libs” style of TPUSA. Basically, there are two paths. To Rep. Crenshaw, “conservative principles aren’t exclusionary, and I firmly believe the Republican Party must continue to grow.” But in Fuentes’s view, that’s not true — conservatism must be white, Christian, and heterosexual. As he posted on his Telegram account, “America is NOT a propositional nation. We have NO ALLEGIANCE to Israel. We are CHRISTIANS and we don’t promote degeneracy. Demographic replacement is REAL and it will be CATASTROPHIC.” And Fuentes and his army believe that they are the real conservatives and the true inheritors of conservatism, the last real defenders of what they view Trumpism to actually be standing against the “unelected face of Trumpism” in Kirk and other pundits. While Charlie Kirk and others enjoy close ties to the White House, Fuentes and the groyper army believe that he and similar figures are betraying Trump by allowing LGBTQ conservatives within the movement and advocating for legal immigration. Or, as neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, editor of Daily Stormer, put it, “We want Donald Trump to do what he said he was going to do. ... Kirk and all of these other shills and Jews are traitors to the revolution. They have attached themselves to Trump to push a big money corporatist, homosexualist, Zionist, globalist agenda.” President Trump’s agenda has been subverted from the beginning by people in his White House or inner circle who didn’t vote for him, aren’t loyal to him, & actively oppose his policies.They are the Globalist GOP swamp trying to recapture the party from Trump and his voters! In a statement, Young Americans for Freedom spokesperson Spencer Brown told me his organization sees the groyper army as working to “advance repugnant views that are antithetical to conservatism’s core belief in the sanctity and equality of every individual. “ But to Fuentes and his groyper army, that’s precisely the problem. At a Kentucky rally, President Trump’s supporters ordered the media to “Do your job!” and reveal the identity of the Ukraine whistleblower. The Wall Street Journal’s Mike Bender explains how these events have changed the American political landscape and Sean Rameswaram speaks with a superfan who has attended 18 rallies and counting.

A shooting in Fresno, California, on Sunday night has left at least four people dead and six people wounded. It occurred at a football watch party. The suspect has not been publicly identified and remains at large. The shooting marks the third mass shooting to take place in California in the past week; the first was a shooting at a high school in Santa Clarita and the second, a family shooting in San Diego. It is the 370th mass shooting in the US in 2019. This story is still developing; here is what we know — and what we don’t — so far:   Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

Blaze Bernstein, age 19 at the time of his murder, loved to cook. Before he traveled back to his home in California for the 2017-’18 winter break, the University of Pennsylvania sophomore had been elected managing editor of a campus cooking publication called Penn Appétit. It’s a position he ended up never filling. On the morning of January 2, his parents noticed that he’d left their house in the Orange County community of Foothill Ranch and tried to contact him. When he didn’t respond, they checked his Snapchat account and found messages between their son and Sam Woodward, a former high school classmate. The two had planned to hang out at a local park. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, texted friends that he and Woodward were meeting for a sexual encounter. Less than a week later, investigators discovered Bernstein’s body in the park, hidden by a tree branch and a mound of dirt. He had been stabbed 19 times in the neck. Authorities quickly identified Woodward as a suspect and found Bernstein’s blood in his car and on a knife in his possession. They learned that Woodward was a member of Atomwaffen Division — one of the most extreme neo-Nazi groups in the country. He was arrested; he pleaded not guilty and is still awaiting trial. The local Jewish community center celebrated Bernstein’s memory by naming its cooking school in his honor. Atomwaffen celebrated Woodward by making T-shirts emblazoned with his mugshot. Bernstein’s 2018 slaying marked the beginning of an extraordinary period of white supremacist violence — a spate of murders and mass shootings that has continued through this year. The October 2018 shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue was the deadliest act of anti-Semitic violence in American history. The March 2019 Islamophobic attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was the deadliest mass shooting in the country’s history. It was followed in April by another attack on an American synagogue (this time in Poway, California), and an August 2019 shooting at an El Paso Walmart that was one of the most brutal attacks targeting Hispanics in US history. In late July, FBI Director Christopher Wray reported that the FBI had made as many domestic terrorism arrests in 2019 as it did in all of 2018 — and further, that “a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we’ve investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.” These killings were often linked to the alt-right, described as an outgrowth of the movement’s rise in the Trump era. But many of these suspected killers, from Atomwaffen thugs to the New Zealand mosque shooter to the Poway synagogue attacker, are more tightly connected to a newer and more radical white supremacist ideology, one that dismisses the alt-right as cowards unwilling to take matters into their own hands. It’s called “accelerationism,” and it rests on the idea that Western governments are irreparably corrupt. As a result, the best thing white supremacists can do is accelerate their demise by sowing chaos and creating political tension. Accelerationist ideas have been cited in mass shooters’ manifestos — explicitly, in the case of the New Zealand killer — and are frequently referenced in white supremacist web forums and chat rooms. Accelerationists reject any effort to seize political power through the ballot box, dismissing the alt-right’s attempts to engage in mass politics as pointless. If one votes, one should vote for the most extreme candidate, left or right, to intensify points of political and social conflict within Western societies. Their preferred tactic for heightening these contradictions, however, is not voting, but violence — attacking racial minorities and Jews as a way of bringing us closer to a race war, and using firearms to spark divisive fights over gun control. The ultimate goal is to collapse the government itself; they hope for a white-dominated future after that. Accelerationism has bizarre roots in academia. But as strange as the racist movement’s intellectual history may be, experts believe it has played a significant and under-appreciated role in the current wave of extremist violence. “It’s not an ideology that exists in a theoretical sense,” says Joanna Mendelson, a senior investigative researcher at the Anti-Defamation League. “It’s an ideology that has actually manifested in real-world violence.” The earliest version of “accelerationism” was, ironically enough, in some ways a celebration of the status quo. The mainstream ethos of the 1990s was thoroughly capitalist, the collapse of the Soviet Union creating a sense that the spread of the American economic and political model was inevitable and irresistible. This coincided with a technological revolution — the rise of widespread internet access and the birth of mass internet culture, a sense of a world defined by and connected through technology in previously incomprehensible ways. At the University of Warwick, a relatively new but well-regarded English university, a young philosophy professor named Nick Land argued that the triumph of capitalism and the rise of technoculture were inextricably intertwined. Drawing on the work of famously dense continental theorists like Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Jean-Francois Lyotard, Land argued that capitalist technological advancement was transforming not just our societies, but our very selves. The self, he believed, was being dissolved by the increasing speed and pace of modern life — the individual was becoming less important than the techno-capitalist system it found itself in. “Modernity has Capitalism (the self-escalating techno-commercial complex) as its motor,” Land wrote in an email to Vox, in characteristically cryptic style. “Our question was what ‘the process’ wants (i.e. spontaneously promotes) and what resistances it provokes.” The “we” he’s referring to is the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a group of Warwick faculty members and graduate students who worked with Land to examine the questions that would come to define this early accelerationism. The writing that came out of CCRU’s work has a hallucinatory, ethereal quality that makes it hard to figure out exactly what they’re trying to say (Land’s marquee book is titled Fanged Noumena). It also feels very of its time; CCRU members obsessed over electronica and used the word “cyber” a lot, all conveying a sense of a society rapidly accelerating toward an exciting future. The CCRU was a fount of mad energy, obsessed with the pace of life under late capitalism; its members had utter disregard for traditional academic norms about scholarship and behavior. This could not last long. The CCRU split from Warwick in 1998, long after the university’s philosophy department had grown tired of its antics. According to Andy Beckett, a journalist who chronicled the CCRU’s rise and fall in the Guardian, Land and his remaining followers moved into a home in Leamington formerly owned by prominent British satanist Aleister Crowley, part of an obsession with the occult that had flourished in the accelerationist ranks. Beckett describes a psychologically tortured group that would scribble strange diagrams on the walls of Crowley’s former home. In Fanged Noumena, Land describes his “tool of choice” during his darkest period as “the sacred substance amphetamine ... after perhaps a year of fanatical abuse [I] was, by any reasonable standard, profoundly insane.” After the CCRU’s collapse, its members spread across British academia as well as fields ranging from journalism to music production. Its ideas rose to prominence again in the early 2010s, taking two separate, and opposed political turns. One was left-wing and academic, a school of Marxist thought focusing on how technology can be conscripted toward building a post-capitalist future. The other was right-wing, and in major part a product of Land’s mind. After his breakdown, Land moved to China and became enamored with its techno-authoritarian political system. He worked as a journalist, reporting uncritically and favorably on the Chinese regime’s accomplishments. When I asked him which politicians he admired, he said he’s “not huge on political figures” on the scene today. However, he added, “[Singaporean technocratic authoritarian] Lee Kuan Yew and [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping were greats.” Land turned this admiration for technocratic strongmen into an entire political ideology. Linking up online with the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin — who writes under the pen name Mencius Moldbug — he helped construct the doctrine of “neoreaction,” or NRx, essentially an argument that democracy had outlived its usefulness. In his 2013 series of essays on the topic, titled The Dark Enlightenment, Land argues that the ideal state is a capitalist monarchy described as “gov-corp,” the state-controlled by an authoritarian CEO organizing policy according to the dictates of “rational corporate governance.” It was essentially a hard-right spin on accelerationism. Neoreactionaries argue that egalitarian and democratic policies described as “progressive” by left-liberals are, in fact, a way of slowing down the only progress worth having — acceleration toward techno-capitalist singularity. Neoreaction is a version of accelerationism adapted to address this problem. “Neoreaction is Accelerationism with a flat tire,” Land wrote in a 2013 blog post. “Beside the speed machine, or industrial capitalism, there is an ever more perfectly weighted decelerator ... comically, the fabrication of this braking mechanism is proclaimed as progress. It is the Great Work of the Left.” Though NRx has no mainstream proponents, it does have connections to prominent figures. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly read neoreactionary literature, and Trump-backing venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s fund supported Moldbug’s tech startup Urbit. In emails to right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos obtained by Buzzfeed, Moldbug claimed to be “coaching Thiel,” telling Yiannopoulos that he “watched the [2016] election at [Thiel’s] house ... He’s fully enlightened.” The extreme right-wing internet is a small place. The rise of neoreaction inevitably led it to cross paths with another online fringe movement of the mid-2010s: the alt-right. Members of the two movements didn’t agree on everything: While Land and Moldbug valorize capitalism and see democracy as the major barrier to a better future, alt-right ideologues like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor valorize whiteness and see Jews and non-whites as the problem. Nonetheless, the two shared core ideas, like an emphasis on the role of genetics in creating human hierarchies, that make them comfortable coexisting in the same online spaces. “Although I am not a white nationalist, I am not exactly allergic to the stuff,” as Moldbug once put it. (Land is somewhat more critical, writing in The Dark Enlightenment that “the opportunity for viable ethno-supremacist politics disappears into a logical abyss.”) The result is considerable cross-pollination between neoreactionaries and the alt-right. Ideas and terminology crossed the different group lines; some fringe influencers, such as the YouTuber Colin “Millennial Woes” Robertson, have described themselves as being both neoreactionaries and members of the alt-right. A 2018 Southern Poverty Law Center investigation found that several posters on The Right Stuff , an alt-right website, were heavily influenced by neoreaction. “Many of the ideological seeds that would make me open to Hitlerism started with Dark Enlightenment,” one of the posters quoted in the study wrote. This is the most likely means through which the racist movement became introduced to the term “accelerationism.” There’s no meaningful use of the term or attention paid to Land among American racists prior to the alt-right’s encounter with The Dark Enlightenment — and why would there have been? An abstruse techno-capitalist philosophy seems to have little in common with the herrenvolk hatred of the KKK. It wasn’t until the rise of neoreaction and the alt-right — two very online movements that shared members in common — that the encounter would have happened. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that “accelerationism” has displaced the alt-right in the eyes of many internet racists. In popular usage, the “alt-right” is generally taken to refer to racists on the internet. That’s actually a bit imprecise: The alt-right is a specific subset of online racists, one that believes white nationalism can triumph by trolling journalists and staging real-life demonstrations like Charlottesville. The basic model is Hitler and the Nazi party: Win power through democratic elections, then enact your goals. This has long been a controversial strategy in the neo-Nazi community. It had been tried before in the 1950s and 1960s by the American Nazi Party, whose charismatic leader, George Lincoln Rockwell, attempted to turn it into a legitimate force. Rockwell staged a rally on the National Mall, demonstrated against civil rights, and planned marches through Jewish neighborhoods on Jewish holidays. This amounted to very little politically and, in 1967, Rockwell was assassinated by a former member of his own party. The alt-right’s leaders believed the time was right for another try, in large part thanks to Donald Trump and the internet. Trump is seen by the alt-right not as a crypto-Nazi, but as an outsider sympathetic to white nationalist goals. He served as a figurehead, a rallying point that could help them convert larger numbers of Americans to their cause. The internet allowed them to try out their message with a mass audience: memes and trolling and message boards allowed them to bypass media gatekeepers and reach Trump fans who might be receptive to white nationalist ideas directly. Indeed, the combination of Trump’s rise and alt-right online activity did swell the movement’s ranks considerably. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, was supposed to be proof of concept, a demonstration that the pro-Trump shitposters could be turned into a real-world political movement. What actually happened was a wave of national revulsion and backlash, particularly after the murder of counterprotester Heather Heyer by a white nationalist. The alt-right lost access to social media platforms, was hounded out of public demonstrations by Antifa, and unequivocally denounced by virtually everyone in American politics (except Trump). The second Unite the Right rally, held in DC in 2018, was a pathetically low-turnout affair. The silver lining for the alt-right — the president’s “very fine people” comment — wasn’t enough to salvage things. Trump, despite all his vicious rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies, had failed to stop what white supremacists see as the existential threat to America: the country’s long-term movement toward becoming a majority-minority country. The alt-right’s theory of change through elections lost favor with others on the white supremacist fringe. “From 2015, when Trump announced and attacked Mexicans that first day, through around Charlottesville, these people really thought they were going to be victorious in the electoral [process] and be able to take a peaceful route back to power,” says Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project. “That has been completely given up on.” This was the moment that neo-Nazi accelerationism really began its rise to prominence — and promote its new and more violent theory of change to supplant the ideas of the “alt-cucks,” as accelerationists derisively termed their white nationalist opponents. Like neoreaction, neo-Nazi accelerationism holds that the liberal-democratic order is a failure — that we should move beyond it toward a better future, and that the task of political action should be to accelerate the speed of that transformation. Only in their view, that “better future” is not capitalist authoritarianism, but the total collapse of a degenerate and corrupt Western society — and the rebirth, out of its ashes, of a new political order more hospitable to white domination. Their main inspiration on how exactly to “accelerate” this process came from James Mason, a previously unheralded neo-Nazi writer who produced a newsletter called Siege in the 1980s. In Siege, Mason uses the collapse of George Lincoln Rockwell’s political strategy to claim that any attempt to work inside the parameters of normal politics was doomed to failure. A better approach, he argued, was pioneered by serial killer Charles Manson — a correspondent of Mason’s who deeply influenced the theories developed in Siege. The murders committed by Manson and his disciples served, in his mind, as a model of decentralized violent action that would be hard for authorities to stop. If neo-Nazis emulated Manson on an individual level, killed and tortured select targets, eventually they could help spur a white uprising against the system — accelerate the pace of a societal collapse already made inevitable by Jewish and non-white corruption, and set the stage for its replacement by a Fourth Reich. “If I were asked by anyone of my opinion on what to look for (or hope for) next I would tell them a wave of killings, or ‘assassinations’ of System bureaucrats by roving gun men who have their strategy well mapped-out in advance and well-nigh impossible to stop,” Mason writes in Siege. “His greatest concern must be to pick his target well so that his act may speak so clearly for itself that no member of White America can mistake its message.” Mason is still alive today. He lives in Denver and looks like an unremarkable bearded white man — that is, when he isn’t wearing his vintage Nazi uniform and a swastika arm band. He languished in obscurity until 2017, when members of the militant neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen tracked him down. The group was founded in 2015 and had long admired him; many of its members were on Iron March, a neo-Nazi web forum that was an early promoter of violent accelerationism. After linking up with Mason in real life, they received his blessing to continue aggressively promoting his ideas, to promote websites with names like Siege Culture aimed at updating Mason’s framework for modern times. The accelerationism they preached centered on heightening the contradictions, using violence both to target their enemies and force a harsh response from the political system — eventually, they hoped, demolishing the state apparatus that stands between us and a white-dominated future. 2017 was a good time for such a doctrine to begin spreading: The alt-right was buckling under post-Charlottesville strains, drawing adherents from those extremists disenchanted with the alt-right’s comparatively cautious approach. They adopted the alt-right’s tactic of trolling and shitposting to popularize their more violent ideas; the phrase “Read Siege” became a meme they pushed on social media. Atomwaffen organized itself into cells: Adherents would meet up at physical “hate camps,” practice with rifles, and plan their next move. Accelerationist ideas flourished separately on social media platforms and extremist web forums like 8chan and Fascist Forge, reaching neo-Nazi groups around the globe. The dedication to violence in accelerationist spaces is scary. They openly fantasize about the need to kill Jews and non-whites and even celebrate ideologically opposed acts of violence — like Islamist terror attacks — as a blow against the system. Though violence is celebrated as the preeminent tactic, they’re willing to endorse non-violent means as well. Accelerationists have proposed distributing flyers for racist rallies alongside ones for a counter-rally, to stoke social division and create conflict. They suggest you should always vote for the most radical candidate in any election, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, to undermine the system’s coherence. One poster I saw even heralded the rise of Bernie Sanders, a Jewish socialist, on the grounds that his proposed expansions of the welfare state would bankrupt the US government and thus undermine its grip on power. In their view, any sort of increase in social tension is good as long as it accelerates us toward system collapse — and individuals have an obligation to do what they can to hasten us along this path. Even, or more precisely, especially committing murder. “I would be willing,” as one Fascist Forge contributor put it, “to use all resources possible for accelerationism.” Starting in 2017, Atomwaffen members began practicing what they preached. From that year on, the group has been publicly linked to at least five killings, including Blaze Bernstein’s. In October 2019, police in Washington arrested Kaleb Cole, believed to be the leader of the state’s Atomwaffen division, and seized eight guns from his residence. They believed he was about to commit a mass shooting. But the thing about accelerationism today is that it does not require any organized plot or group to lead to mass murder. Accelerationist justifications for violence have suffused online white nationalist spaces to the point where anyone can encounter it and draw their own murderous conclusions. “There is an entire subculture of individuals who are promoting this concept, who advocate for sabotage and destruction against the system,” Mendelson, the Anti-Defamation League researcher, says. “It only takes that one individual who’s inspired by the rhetoric on that message board to act.” The internet has allowed James Mason’s original vision, “lone wolf” violence, to become a reality, not just in the United States but globally: Accelerationism seems to have played a role in the March 2019 Christchurch shooter’s decision to gun down Muslims while they prayed.  Christchurch shooter Brenton Tarrant’s motivation was a mix of hate and fear: Like all contemporary white supremacists, he believed non-white population growth was an existential threat to his race. His manifesto is titled “The Great Replacement,” a term coined by a French writer but in context refers to the theory of “white genocide” by demography that goes back decades in the white supremacist movement. Tarrant’s plan for stopping white genocide drew liberally from accelerationist ideas; he literally titled a section of the manifesto “Destabilization and Accelerationism: tactics for victory.” “Why did you carry out the attack? ... To add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilizing and polarizing Western society in order to eventually destroy the current nihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity that has taken control of Western thought,” he writes. “The change we need to enact only arises in the great crucible of crisis.” It’s difficult to overstate the influence of Tarrant’s attack and manifesto on the internet’s racist right. The Christchurch shooting claimed 51 lives, one of the deadliest white supremacist terror attacks in modern history. The sheer violence of the assault on New Zealand’s small Muslim community turned his manifesto into a must-read on the racist right — and made accelerationism into one of the dominant ideas on the fringe right today.  “Atomwaffen was a relatively insular universe. When the Christchurch shooter starts describing this, it makes a big jump to the wider consciousness of the white supremacist movement,” the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Beirich says. “That clear statement of accelerationism in the Christchurch shooter’s manifesto took this to another level. Now, pretty much everybody on the radical right has read this stuff, imbibed this stuff — and he put it into the public domain for white supremacists.” In April, about a month after Christchurch, a man named John Earnest entered a synagogue in Poway, California, and began firing on worshippers. Earnest’s manifesto is a mix of old-school Christian anti-Semitism and internet-era hatred; the manifesto cites both Tarrant and 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers as inspiration, but seems particularly inspired by Tarrant’s writing (“Tarrant was a catalyst for me personally,” he writes). At one point, Earnest explicitly borrows a clearly accelerationist idea from Tarrant’s manifesto: the idea that using a gun in an attack could hasten the state’s collapse by stoking conflict over gun control. “I used a gun for the same reason that Brenton Tarrant used a gun,” he writes. “The goal is for the US government to start confiscating guns. People will defend their right to own a firearm — civil war has just started.” Several months after Christchurch and Poway, a third white nationalist named Patrick Crusius shot up a Walmart in El Paso, specifically targeting Hispanic patrons. Like Tarrant, Crusius was obsessed with the idea of a demographic threat from non-white immigrants. He pledged his allegiance to the New Zealand killer’s way of thinking. “I support the Christchurch shooter and his manifesto,” he wrote in a pre-attack screed. “The Hispanic community was not my target before I read The Great Replacement.” It’s tricky to say definitively that accelerationism “caused” Blaze Bernstein’s murder, other acts of Atomwaffen violence, or the three white supremacist mass shootings of 2019. There is almost always a complex web of personal reasons for why an individual chooses to kill; It’s possible they would have turned violent regardless of what ideas they were exposed to. The influence of accelerationism is clearer in some of the killers’ writings than in others (Crusius’s manifesto, in particular, doesn’t seem too indebted to the theory). Accelerationism is a diffuse idea, and it’s best to think of its influence as such. Neo-Nazis didn’t need accelerationism to be violent, but rather the doctrine’s omnipresence in online far-right spaces makes it more likely that both groups and individuals are inspired to embrace terrorism as a tactic. The frequent expressions of support for violence increase the baseline risk that someone turns to it. “As late as Dylann Roof [the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooter], the reaction of white supremacists was kind of ambivalent,” says Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League. “Now ... they want more people like that to emerge.” It’s hard to even say how many spaces there are encouraging that process. Atomwaffen is not the only organized group promoting accelerationism; other groups whose ideas fit the doctrine are the Bowl Gang, a small group of online propagandists who lionize Roof; and The Base, a trans-Atlantic neo-Nazi umbrella group that explicitly aims to turn online chatter into real-world violence. These groups have also largely moved beyond open web forums like Iron March, Fascist Forge, and the now-shuttered 8chan. You can find their content on major social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter, but most of it has to be masked or heavily censored in order to avoid bans. (One accelerationist video I watched on YouTube bleeped out the word “Nazi” in the narration in an effort to dodge the censors.) The real hubs of accelerationist activity are secure messaging platforms like Telegram, apps that are harder for law enforcement to surveil and easier to keep free of outside influence. Journalists and professional hate-watchers have gotten access to their channels, but it’s impossible to know exactly how many are operating outside of anyone’s view. Barring federal regulations weakening the encryption protections for these platforms — a proposal that raises serious privacy and data security concerns — it may not be possible to effectively keep tabs on what accelerationists are saying to each other and what they’re planning. White supremacist violence tends to come in waves, with high-profile killings typically inspiring copycats until the movement is exhausted. In that sense, the current wave of accelerationist-influenced violence is hardly unprecedented. But this is the first such wave in the era of internet ubiquity and is largely made up of young, digital-native men. Accelerationists instinctively understand that their statements and actions can rapidly reach a planetary audience. They are exploiting the speed of life under late capitalism to spread hate to the masses, a dark parody of the techno-capitalist singularity posited by CCRU theorists in the early 1990s. In our correspondence, Nick Land told me that “the assumption” behind accelerationism was that “the general direction of [techno-capitalist] self-escalating change was toward decentralization.” It seems that this was partly correct — but in a far more horrifying way than anyone at the time could have anticipated.

Elections for Virginia’s state legislature are Democrats’ first big enthusiasm test before the 2020 elections start. That said, they’re a bit of an oddity. Tuesday’s elections are happening in an off-year. That means there are no statewide offices like governor on the ballot — the elections for the House of Delegates and state Senate are the biggest races. All seats in both chambers are up this year, and Democrats could be on the verge of winning a majority in each. They’re just two seats away from retaking the state House and Senate, but a shift in power could be particularly tricky in the House, where Democrats are defending a lot of territory. In past off-years, turnout hasn’t been very high; there’s usually not a ton of interest in state legislative elections alone. But there may be a silver lining to not having Gov. Ralph Northam not on the ballot; both he and his lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, spent part of this year embroiled in separate scandals (Northam for blackface photos in an old medical school yearbook, and Fairfax for sexual assault allegations). Even with state lawmakers being at the top of the ticket, Democrats and grassroots activists told Vox they’re seeing signs of more enthusiasm for voting than usual. “I think the intensity going in is so strong,” said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a group aiming to increase the diversity of the Virginia electorate by encouraging minorities and immigrants to vote. The perceived interest in a normally sleepy election is part of what makes this an interesting test for Democrats and Republicans alike for 2020. For Democrats, it’s a question of how well organized and enthusiastic the party is. For Republicans, it’s a test of whether they can hang onto power in a state that’s been trending blue for years. No Republican has won statewide office since 2009, yet they’ve clung to slim majorities in both chambers of the state assembly. “It shows you the relative strength of the parties at this point in time without anybody at the top of the ticket,” Republican strategist John Feehery told Vox. “If you take away any personalities, it just gives you a glimpse with a natural setting of what the political barometer is.” The 2017 election year was very good for Virginia Democrats, and was an early sign of what was to come nationally in the 2018 midterms. Coming off of 2016, pollsters had been cautious about making any definitive predictions about Virginia. Democrats won the governor’s seat in 2017, and although they didn’t win a majority in the House of Delegates, they captured 15 seats and came a lot closer than pollsters had predicted. The key groups that came out that year — and that Democrats are hoping come out again in 2019 — were young voters, and non-white voters. “We need this year to look like 2017 as much as it possibly can,” said Democratic pollster Joshua Ulibarri, who works for Lake Research Partners and has been surveying Virginia districts in the run-up to both election years. “If that happens, Democrats are in good shape.” Ulibarri shared some polling numbers with Vox showing that motivation to vote among voters in several key districts in the run-up to 2019 is higher than it was in 2017. “Democrats are as or more motivated to vote than Republicans this year and motivation is up this year compared to the 2017 election,” Ulibarri said, calling that bump “remarkable” considering these elections are just for the state legislature. “These races literally have state legislature at the top of the ballot and some of these seats, because of how they were drawn, have been uncontested for years.” Despite lackluster fundraising and being outspent by Republicans in past years, Democrats have boosted their spending in Virginia state legislative races by quite a bit. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced they’d spend $1 million back in December, and Democrats will commit nearly $2 million into the races by the end of the cycle. Outside groups including Emily’s List, Everytown for Gun Safety, Forward Majority, and the League of Conservation Voters are also spending. Democrats especially have their eye on the state Senate, where they are challenging a number of Republican incumbents. It could be a bit harder to win the state House of Delegates; a slew of Democratic incumbents elected in 2017 are on the ballot as well. But overall, Democrats are feeling cautiously optimistic. “I would say I’m less nervous [than 2017], but at the same time I’m not going on the record right now saying Democrats are going to flip both chambers,” said Carolyn Fiddler, the communications director for progressive group Daily Kos and a former DLCC spokesperson. Even though Virginia passed Medicaid expansion last year when a handful of Republicans decided to support the provisions, health care still ranks as a top issue for many Virginia voters. Voters are still frustrated with the high cost of prescription drugs, and Democrats want to have majorities to fight back against Republican bills that would allow insurers to not cover those with preexisting conditions. “They’re still feeling like there’s a heavy expense for prescription drugs, and they want to know how you’re going to try to get some of these costs down,” Virginia state Delegate Lashrecse Aird (D), who represents a predominantly minority district, told Vox. Another huge issue that has come up both in Aird’s community as well as around the state is the issue of gun violence. In June, Northam called a special legislative session to address gun violence after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach claimed the lives of 12 people. Ultimately, the session didn’t yield any progress; Republicans adjourned it after just 90 minutes, without taking up a single bill. Aird said gun violence in Virginia isn’t just mass shootings; it includes violence that’s more frequent and less talked about. “In communities of color, it’s like, ‘I’m hearing gunshots,’” Aird said, referring to a complaint she hears from constituents. “That’s top of mind for a lot of communities of color.” Democrats statewide are also eyeing a laundry list of priorities that have been blocked by Republicans in the past, including the potential to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour and pass a state Equal Rights Amendment that would give civil rights protections to LGBTQ individuals. There’s also the inescapable factor that whoever wins the state house will be in control of drawing congressional districts after the 2020 census. (Virginia Republicans had previously drawn maps in their party’s favor until a court struck them down as a racial gerrymander.) Voters are “starting to pay attention to what the politicians are saying, and not only what they’re saying, but what they’re doing,” Nguyen told Vox. Democrats in Virginia and across the country are waiting to see what effect that renewed focus will have at the ballot box on Tuesday — and how it may affect the presidential race.

The nation’s most powerful gun rights organization was dramatically outspent in Virginia in 2019 by gun control organizations, helping Democrats gain control of the state legislature for the first time in more than two decades. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the National Rifle Association spent $350,269 this cycle to help pro-gun rights candidates beat back Democrats who were running on a gun control platform, one that became particularly poignant after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31 left 12 people dead. (An NRA spokesperson cautioned that total spending numbers for the organization will not be available until later this month.) But gun control groups spent far more, hoping to help get Democratic candidates into office who could push forward a package of proposals aimed at stemming gun violence, including background checks on all firearms sales and a ban on so-called “assault weapons.” Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund and Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund (backed in part by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) report that they spent $2.5 million in Virginia, making the group the biggest outside donor in the race — and Giffords PAC, named for former Rep. Gabby Giffords, spent $300,000 on a digital ad campaign alone. Democrats didn’t win either the House of Delegates or Senate seat for Virginia Beach, but across the state, gun control was the top issue for voters and for Democratic candidates, according to one poll, with several candidates running explicitly on vows to “take on the NRA” to pass gun control legislation. According to Everytown, that focus (and money) resulted in at least three flipped seats that helped Democrats take control of the legislature. Gov. Ralph Northam said Wednesday that he now hopes to be able to pass a slate of gun control measures, and “because of that Virginia will be safer.” The gun control push in Virginia comes as the NRA is perhaps in its weakest position in years, the result of lawsuits and an investigation by New York State officials that has put the organization’s finances under a microscope. In draft remarks to reporters, Everytown CEO John Feinblatt said Wednesday, “NRA is a paper tiger.” He added, “The NRA may be based in Fairfax, Virginia, but we outspent them in Virginia by 8-1. In other words, the NRA couldn’t defend its own backyard.” On May 31, 2019, a public utilities employee walked into a Virginia Beach Municipal Center and shot more than a dozen people both inside and outside the building, killing 12 and injuring four others before dying in a firefight with police. In a press conference after the shooting, Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer described the attack as “the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.” In response, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called a special session of the Virginia legislature and put forth eight proposals aimed at tightening the state’s gun laws, including a ban on silencers and so-called “assault weapons,” limiting handgun purchases, and creating a Extreme Risk Protective Order so that law enforcement could take firearms from people deemed to be potential threats (a proposal the NRA voiced support for in March 2018.) But as my colleague Catherine Kim reported earlier this year: When the legislature convened, the GOP shut down the meeting in less than two hours. The group refused to address gun control, saying that not enough research had been conducted on the appropriate legislative direction prior to the “premature” session, and suggested Virginia do what it did after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, when then-Gov. Tim Kaine, commissioned a blue-ribbon panel to study mental health and gun control. The legislature ultimately passed some of the panel’s recommendations. Virginia has comparatively loose gun laws — the state permits open carry and does not require a permit to purchase or have a rifle, shotgun, or handgun, but it does regulate gun shows. The Giffords Law Center, which supports gun control measures, gave the state a “D” rating for its existing laws. (It’s worth noting that Guns and Ammo Magazine, which supports a maximalist interpretation of gun rights, ranked the state No. 31 in the country, noting efforts by Democrats to pass gun control legislation.) And the majority of Virginia Republicans in the legislature received “A” grades from the NRA. The Republican-controlled legislature ultimately took no votes on either the measures proposed by Northam or those put forward by other Virginia lawmakers, a decision Northam called “shameful and disappointing,” particularly since the legislature would not be reporting back to work until November 18 — several weeks after the election. In response, gun control organizations made Virginia a priority, particularly as all 140 legislative seats in the increasingly blue state were up for grabs this cycle. That — plus recent redistricting due to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering of congressional districts — made flipping both the Virginia House and Senate a real possibility. In his remarks, Feinblatt said, “There’s no question about it: What happened in Virginia Beach — and most importantly, what didn’t happen afterwards — set the stage for this election.” The NRA argued that, in this race, it emphasized donor contact and get-out-the-vote efforts rather than big donations. In comments to the Washington Post in September, NRA spokesperson Catherine Mortensen said in part, “The Bloomberg and Everytown/Moms Demand lobbyists may outspend the NRA, but they will never outwork us.” But that wasn’t the case just two years ago, when the gun rights group spent more than $2 million in the state, including a $750,000 advertising buy aimed at lifting Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie. That was a race with statewide offices at stake, not legislative ones, but it’s still a good indication of how much the NRA cared about defending gun rights in the state: $2 million was bigger than the NRA’s in-state spending in any of the three previous cycles, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. As I’ve been reporting, the NRA — still powered by its 5 million members and a close relationship with the White House — has been struggling both politically and financially. The group was largely unable to get much of its legislative agenda through Congress while Republicans held total control in 2017 and 2018, and revenue drops resulted in less available cash to spend in the 2018 midterms. The NRA’s revenue from membership dues — a one-year membership costs $45 — has dropped 21 percent since 2016, from $163 million to $128 million, according to the nonpartisan transparency organization OpenSecrets. Other donations to the NRA dropped too, from $128 million in 2016 to $98 million in 2017. That revenue drop has led to cost-cutting measures across the organization, from raising the cost of dues to dropping free coffee and water at its Fairfax, Virginia, headquarters to major layoffs at the group’s media outlet, NRATV. But most importantly, the revenue drop dramatically impacted how involved the NRA got in the 2018 midterm elections. The group got involved in about half the races in 2018 that it did during the previous midterm cycle, and the amount it spent dropped as well — from $25 million in 2014 to less than half that this cycle. That revenue drop came as the result of massive spending in the 2016 election to get Donald Trump in the White House. And the challenges facing the organization go far beyond revenue. Coupled with a federal investigation into the group’s ties with Russian entities, the NRA has faced the loss of one of the group’s top lobbyists, Chris Cox; a lawsuit filed against New York State over an insurance program aimed at helping NRA members who are involved in self-defense shootings; and another series of lawsuits filed against the NRA’s former advertising and public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen. Those lawsuits have centered on a series allegations of financial mismanagement and fraud leveled against Ackerman McQueen by the NRA, and allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of funds against the NRA by Ackerman McQueen. As I reported a few weeks ago: The lawsuits have already proven deeply embarrassing to both the NRA and to Ackerman McQueen, and cost both entities millions in court costs. For Ackerman, the NRA was once the firm’s most prominent and lucrative client; now the firm is facing a lawsuit that could cost it millions. And for the NRA, the allegations — high-spending executives, accusations of sexual harassment, and an overall lack of oversight — have damaged the group’s reputation among some gun rights supporters. Even President Donald Trump has urged the NRA to “get its act together,” and the allegations against LaPierre have riled prominent members of NRA’s leadership. If Tuesday’s results in Virginia are any indication, however, America’s largest gun lobby did not “get its act together.” In a statement on the election, the NRA argued that Virginians would ultimately reject gun-control candidates and concluded, “As the battle continues, so does the NRA’s defense of the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.” But the lawsuits, investigations, and loss of funding have all been a massive distraction for the NRA, and gun control organizations are taking advantage. In Virginia, those organizations have helped shift the balance of power in the state legislature and, with it, hope to push for gun control legislation in a state that houses the country’s biggest gun rights group.

443,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-does-a-warning-by-anonymous-really-tell-us,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By Amy Davidson Sorkin Different readers of “A Warning,” by “Anonymous, a Senior Trump Administration Official,” will likely grow restless at different points. For some, that moment might be when Anonymous writes that, at some moment, his, her, or their colleagues almost made a dramatic stand against Trump, such as in a mass resignation. (“Every time this was contemplated, it was rejected.”)  For others, it may be when Anonymous reports that “no one in the Trump White House is a fan of Hillary Clinton” and that he, she, or they support many of Trump’s policy goals, such as getting rid of “burdensome red tape” and cutting taxes. Or it could be at one of the many, many quotes from Aristotle, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, miscellaneous Founding Fathers and Presidents, Henry Kissinger, Friedrich Hayek, Karl Popper, and, of course, Tocqueville, which, while often instructive or eloquent (who doesn’t like Lincoln’s Second Inaugural?), begin to feel like filler. Or perhaps it’s when Anonymous describes the reactions of the people the author calls Steady Staters, otherwise known as the adults in the room, or, alternatively, members of the deep state, such as when, in February, 2018—the month of the Parkland mass shooting—Trump suggests to his aides that teachers should be given guns. Anonymous writes, “Most sane folks raised an eyebrow. The teachers we remembered tended to be gentler souls like Betty White, not Annie Oakley. We wanted to hand Betty and all of her colleagues a pistol?” Has Anonymous seen a Betty White movie lately? There might be something to learn from the acerbic fearlessness that her performances embody. The problem is not that many teachers are women, or that they are older women—and often tough, brave, creative souls. The problem is that guns are guns. But the definitive moment of restlessness for most readers will likely come at the opening of the book, when Anonymous attempts to explain his, her, or their choice to be anonymous. This is the second time around: in September, 2018, this same Anonymous published an Op-Ed in the Times, entitled, “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.” In that piece, Anonymous said that these Administration resisters, though they supported many of Trump’s policies, had “vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.” That was, perhaps, a problematic rationale for remaining nameless—who elected Anonymous?—but it was, at least, a rationale. The simultaneously alarming and tiresome thing about “A Warning” is that Anonymous freely acknowledges that having Administration officials act as silent babysitters doesn’t work. Anonymous now doubts that the course charted in the Op-Ed is “effective, let alone sustainable.” Earlier, Anonymous would tell friends that the reason to remain working in the Administration was to “keep it together.” That answer now “feels more hollow than it used to.” Anonymous & Company “are not bulwarks against the president and shouldn’t be counted on to keep him in check.” Instead, as a rationale for continued anonymity, Anonymous points to Alexander Hamilton’s use of a pseudonym for the Federalist Papers; anonymity is preferable, according to Anonymous, because this story is not about him, her, or they, but “about us”—meaning Americans, generally. Without a person to attack ad hominem, Anonymous writes, Trump will be forced to deal with the revelations themselves. But most of “us” haven’t been in meetings with Trump and personally heard how unstable and scornful of democratic norms he can be, which is something that Anonymous claims to have done. Anonymous may have compelling reasons for not going public, and that’s fine. But let’s not make this about Hamilton. In this case, the lack of a name is a loss. This is a particular pity because there is much in the book that is alarming, if not entirely new. “I am not qualified to diagnose the president’s mental acuity,” Anonymous writes. “All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by [sic] what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country.” Trump also, Anonymous writes, regularly urges that the law be broken or ignored, and discussions of potentially criminal acts are so routinized that “we can tell when Trump is preparing to ask his lawyers to do something unethical or foolish because that’s when he starts scanning the room for note takers”: “What the fuck are you doing?” he shouted at an aide who was
scribbling in a notebook during a meeting . . . The room went silent.
The aide seemed confused about what was wrong. “Are you fucking taking notes?” Trump continued, glaring. “Uhh...sorry,” the aide said, quietly closing the notebook and sitting
up straighter in the chair. His paranoia is the best evidence of a guilty conscience. Great story. But what was the meeting about? What potential crime might the notes have shown? Anonymous doesn’t say. That reticence may also be a function of the choice to be anonymous. In the introduction, Anonymous writes that the book has been “carefully written to prevent any inadvertent disclosure,” that the author did not personally witness some of the scenes described, and that he, she, or they “may refer to myself in the third person.” Anonymous also notes that “certain details have been withheld or modified without changing the facts in order to preserve the anonymity of those involved.” It would be helpful to know where Anonymous draws the line between modifying a detail and changing a fact—particularly at a political moment when there is a threat to the idea that such a distinction has value. Many of the quotes and the incidents in “A Warning” have been cited elsewhere, which makes the book useful as a compendium. But it would be hard for someone not immersed in Trumpiana to tell what Anonymous has heard firsthand or maybe just read in the Mueller report (one of the sources mentioned)—what he, she, or they can personally attest to and back up. Could Anonymous, with a name attached, have had a far more powerful effect, in the way that some of the witnesses in the impeachment hearings have had? That question is not really examined. Perhaps all this writerly maneuvering is necessary to protect anonymity, but anonymity is most valuable when it allows for specificity—when it is provides dates, the names of attendees of a meeting, references to documents that can be obtained and to hitherto unknown crimes. And Anonymous does not deliver much new in that respect. Indeed, the vagueness extends beyond what might touch on Anonymous’s own identity. “I have deliberately limited my descriptions of fellow senior officials, and where possible I have avoided discussing their actions and opinions by name,” Anonymous writes. This is presented as a virtue, and proof that the book is not meant to “settle scores.” But it doesn’t give anyone who might want to follow up on the stories told much new to work with. At times, it bothers Anonymous that stories of Trump’s behavior have come out. After Trump rants at a meeting about “how fucking stupid” it would be for him to take Saudi Arabia to task for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, given what a break with the Kingdom might do to oil prices, Anonymous writes, “We really hoped that the president wouldn’t go public with that explanation for staying silent. Then he did.” If only he wouldn’t tweet; if only he wouldn’t embarrass the people who work for him. What do we know about Anonymous, other than that he, she, or they is (or was) one of those people? Unless the details in the book have been truly radically modified, the author seems to work in an area related to national security, and to be a Republican of some stripe. (Anonymous concedes, on reflection, that Trump is anti-immigrant, adding, “I still don’t think he’s a hardline racist, but draw your own conclusions.”) The tone and cultural references would seem to be those of a man of a certain age and settled position in life, the kind of Beltway type who refers to Senator McCain as “John”—and who was shattered when Trump resisted lowering the flag after the senator’s death—and who thinks that the most admirable thing about Barack Obama is that he is a “family man.” (Anonymous is glad that Trump has overturned many of Obama’s policies by executive order.) Anonymous has witnessed Trump calling professional women “sweetie” or “honey” and joking about their weight, and did not like it, but notes that “I’m not trying to say that women who work for Trump are victims who can’t handle themselves. Women have had to deal with creeps long before Donald Trump came into office. They don’t need ‘safe spaces’ set up in the West Wing.” Yet at times the atmospheric hints are laid on so thick that one is almost—almost—tempted to entertain the wild idea that they might be part of an identity-hiding feint, and that Anonymous is really, say, a nonbinary Latinx person in their twenties. Certain sentences drift so far into the realm of unintentional self-parody that they almost make more sense as elaborate put-ons. For example: “To understand how far off the reservation the president has gone, you have to look at the world through his soda straw.” The reservation-straying in question has to do with Trump’s support for tariffs, which Anonymous really, really doesn’t like. Anonymous backs up this view with quotes from Adam Smith, “the father of capitalism.” Anonymous had hoped not only to protect the country from Trump but also to “protect him from himself,” which presumably means to help him to be the best Trump that he can be—one who would fix a “broken” asylum system without being distracted by changing designs for a wall. Anonymous wants the focus to be on conservative goals, not on Trump, and remembers cringing when people called the President a liar, believing that the charge was “unfair” and made to “score political points.” But, the author admits, “Now I know it’s true.” In many respects, though, Anonymous is not above trying to score partisan political points. One of the final arguments made in the book is that Democrats have an obligation to show “restraint” and not choose a nominee who might make people like Anonymous uncomfortable. Republicans, in contrast, are assured that Trump is not one of them—not really. Intentionally or not, however, what is most revealing about “A Warning” is the warning it delivers about the Republican Party. Anonymous’s colleagues have not been defeated, exactly; rather, more and more of them have joined the Trump team, which they perceive to be winning. They are no longer his “guardrails” (if they ever were) but his “human shields.” The ascendant faction is one that Anonymous calls the Apologists, who fall into two categories: the Sycophants and the Silent Abettors—one group is louder than the other, but their effect is the same. These people generally act as if they believe in Trump; their “telltale trait” in meetings is “smiling and nodding at the wrong time.” They make him worse, by seconding his delusions or saying things that “buoy his belief that he can take actions that, in reality, he cannot.” Some in the West Wing ask Trump to tweet provocatively, in order “to send raw voltage into the news feeds of his followers in order to light up a new cause.” And Anonymous applies this diagnosis to congressional Republicans, too. Trump has “created a true cult of personality,” becoming the focus of G.O.P. loyalties. The problem is not just that Trump is President. The problem is that this is Donald Trump’s Republican Party.

444,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/11/06/accused-greenville-shooter-released-from-jail-after-new-evidence-officials-say/,"newsCrime By LaVendrick Smith and Dana Branham 6:37 PM on Nov 5, 2019 CST — Updated at 9:36 PM on Nov 5, 2019 CST Updated at 9 p.m.: Revised to include additional details throughout. The 23-year-old man accused in a mass shooting at a party outside Greenville last month was released from jail Tuesday after officials said they’d found evidence likely to clear him of the crime. The Hunt County Sheriff’s Office recommended that the county’s district attorney drop the case against Brandon Ray Gonzales, who had been held on $1 million bail since his arrest Oct. 28 on a capital murder charge. In a statement, the sheriff’s office said “additional information has come to light” since Gonzales’ arrest. “Due to the lack of cooperation from witnesses and discovery of exculpatory evidence during the course of the investigation, we have requested the Hunt County district attorney’s office take no action on Mr. Gonzales’ case at this time and that he be released from custody,"" the statement said. Gonzales was arrested two days after gunfire set off chaos late Oct. 26 at a party celebrating Texas A&M University-Commerce’s homecoming about 15 miles southwest of the campus, which is about 65 miles from Dallas. Two 23-year-old men, Kevin Berry Jr. of Dallas and Byron Craven Jr. of Arlington, were killed. Six others were shot, and several more were injured trying to escape the venue, some crawling through a broken window to flee. Gonzales, alongside his brother and his attorneys, Andrew Wilkerson and Michael Campbell, spoke outside the Hunt County Sheriff’s Office about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, promising to hold the department responsible. After spending nearly nine days in jail, he had two plans: to see his three children, and to get something to eat. He said it hurt sitting in his cell, hearing other people call him ""the shooter."" ""It killed me because that's not my image, that's not who I am, that’s not who I've ever been,"" he said. He said he was haunted by flashbacks of police coming with guns drawn to arrest him at the car dealership where he works. He and his attorneys said he had been in his car on a FaceTime call when the gunfire erupted — he was so far away he didn’t hear anything, but he did see people running from the building. The attorneys said they immediately took that evidence from the call, as well as the accounts of four other people with Gonzales at the time, to the sheriff's office. Campbell called authorities' investigation into the shooting ""shoddy and incomplete."" “This is a national crisis what took place here in Greenville, and we’re appalled that the Texas Rangers and the … sheriff’s department did not do their due diligence in investigating,” he said. “They rushed to judgment when naming Brandon, an innocent man, as a suspect in this case.” Wilkerson said the attorneys would take civil action to hold the sheriff’s department accountable for Gonzales’ arrest. A spokesman for the department did not return calls and messages seeking comment. Gonzales read a letter he wrote in jail in which he asked God for guidance for him, his family and friends ""to help us overcome this darkness."" “Lord, I am your child, and I did no such thing as they are trying to ruin my image on the outside,” he said. “But even then, while I am here, I will remain the same kind, humble and loving person, because I know I’m coming home.” Gonzales’ family said from the start that he was not the gunman. Gabriel Gonzales, his brother, said news of his brother’s release was “amazing.” He credited the community with helping free an innocent man. “I feel like they made the right decision,” he said of authorities. A day after Gonzales’ arrest, a sheriff’s spokesman said the department was “fully confident that we have the right suspect.” The arrest-warrant affidavit for Gonzales appears to rest on the account of one unnamed witness, who reported seeing Gonzales open fire at the party and identified him through his Facebook profile. The witness spoke to authorities along with an attorney, who was also not named in the document. The Rev. Jeff Hood, an activist who organized a protest Saturday of more than 50 people calling for Gonzales’ release, said he was astounded to hear Tuesday evening’s news. “The spirit of justice has prevailed and Brandon Gonzales is free,” he said. He said Gonzales’ release was the result of public pressure. “This wasn’t the result of a hearing — this was the result of the sheriff’s department realizing that they were wrong,” Hood said. State and federal agencies, including the Texas Rangers and the FBI, assisted local authorities with the investigation. Speaking to reporters on the day Gonzales was arrested, Sheriff Randy Meeks said his department had not determined a motive or recovered the weapon used in the shooting. In his statement Tuesday evening, Meeks said the department knew many people at the party had not spoken to law enforcement. As investigators worked the crime scene the day after the shooting, authorities said the investigation had been hindered by witnesses being reluctant to speak. “Though individuals may have reasons for not wishing to come forward, we ask that they do so and tell law enforcement what you saw and heard that night no matter how small the information may be,” Meeks said in the statement. “They may not know the importance of any information they have.” Authorities asked anyone who was present at the party or who has information about the shooting to contact the Hunt County Sheriff’s Office at 903-408-6800.

In his column for the Daily Beast, conservative commentator Matt Lewis made a case that Donald Trump's rise was the inevitable result of a country that has become filled with lonely people who have lost any connection to their community and just want to feel like they belong.

447,https://www.rawstory.com/2019/11/after-surprise-ruling-firearm-makers-may-finally-decide-its-in-their-interest-to-help-reduce-gun-violence/,"Mass shootings have become a routine occurrence in America. Gun-makers have long refused to take responsibility for their role in this epidemic. That may be about to change. The U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 12 refused to block a lawsuit filed by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary mass shooting victims, clearing the way for the litigation to proceed. Remington Arms, which manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the attack, had hoped the broad immunity the industry has enjoyed for years would shield it from any liability. The prospect of more claims from victims of mass shootings puts new pressure on the gun industry to reconsider the way it does business. My research over the past 20 years on lawsuits against the gun industry examines how the threat of civil liability has the potential to promote safer gun designs, encourage more responsible marketing practice and reduce the risk of illegal retail sales. A 2006 law called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act grants gun manufacturers broad immunity from civil lawsuits that arise out of the criminal misuse of a weapon. However, this immunity does not apply where a manufacturer “knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing” of a firearm. The Sandy Hook families allege that Remington, by marketing certain guns to civilians, engaged in “unethical” business methods in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Specifically, they argued Remington “marketed, advertised and promoted the Bushmaster XM15-E2S for civilians to use to carry out offensive, military-style combat missions against their perceived enemies.” Remington asked the court to throw out the lawsuit based on the federal immunity statute, but the Connecticut Supreme Court held that a violation of the state’s unfair trade practices law qualifies as an exception to the industry’s liability shield. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear Remington’s appeal, the case will move into discovery and, potentially, trial in a Connecticut state court. Since many states have unfair trade practices laws like Connecticut’s, gun violence victims are likely to bring similar claims elsewhere, effectively ending the gun industry’s federal immunity from civil lawsuits. In other industries, the threat of civil liability has encouraged manufacturers to take steps in design, marketing and retail to reduce the risk of injuries associated with their products. Lawsuits have prompted automakers to develop safer car designs, vaping companies to end marketing aimed at teens and opioid manufacturers to take responsibility for oversupplying pills to irresponsible retailers. Similarly, exposing gun manufacturers to civil liability is likely to encourage them to consider reducing the lethality of their civilian weapons. The popularity of semiautomatic firearms increases the risk that gun violence incidents will cause multiple gunshot wounds to large numbers of victims. Companies may wish to limit their liability exposure by reducing the firepower of their products. Additionally, companies may wish to reconsider marketing campaigns that extol the combat characteristics of weapons they sell on the civilian market. Such campaigns are likely to give rise to more lawsuits alleging that such promotional tactics increase the risk that their guns will be the weapon of choice for mass shooters. Finally, lawsuits may encourage gun companies to work harder to teach retailers how to spot and prevent illegal straw purchases, in which a person buys a gun for someone else who is legally prohibited from purchasing it. The industry’s trade association – the National Shooting Sports Council – has long had a training and certification program for retailers to reduce the risk of illegal straw purchases. Beefing up that effort is another way to reduce the industry’s liability exposure. None of these actions would weaken the Second Amendment or undermine the commercial viability of the gun industry. Regardless of whether the Sandy Hook families ultimately prevail, the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to hear an appeal in the case appears to have blown a giant hole in the gun industry’s immunity from civil litigation. However, this may not be the court’s last word on the subject. The justices might have another opportunity to review the case if the Sandy Hook plaintiffs win and the case works its way back up to the high court. The Supreme Court could then decide that the exception to federal immunity applies more narrowly. Moreover, there is no guarantee that other state courts will adopt the Connecticut Supreme Court’s interpretation of the immunity exception. Federal courts in New York and California have rejected similar lawsuits. Also, unfair trade practices laws in other states frequently limit lawsuits to product consumers, excluding claims by others injured by the products. In addition, gun violence victims face other challenges in winning their claims. They must convince judges and juries that routine industry marketing strategies constitute unfair trade practices and prove that those practices played a role in enabling criminal attacks. Prior to passage of federal immunity, no plaintiff ever won a lawsuit against a gun manufacturer for an injury arising out of criminal misuse of a weapon. Finally, litigation is not a panacea. Stemming the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. will require a concerted effort by industry, government and organized citizen groups across the political spectrum. Lawsuits can help jump-start this process, but they are only the beginning. [ Expertise in your inbox.

449,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticPoliticsChannel/~3/vn6p6k2iElA/,"Virginia has been a bellwether in the Trump era, and Democrats hope their historic victory last night points to another national win in 2020. The full consequences of the Democratic Party’s victory last night in Virginia won’t become apparent for months or even years to come. By winning both houses of the state legislature, Democrats have turned the state totally blue for the first time in 26 years. They’ll have a chance to pass major new gun laws in the backyard of the Fairfax-based National Rifle Association, to more than double Virginia’s minimum wage, and to solidify their electoral gains by reversing Republican gerrymanders through redistricting two years from now. But the more immediate significance of the results is what they portend for the Democrats’ much bigger battle ahead: They show that the electoral fire on the left sparked by Donald Trump’s stunning victory in 2016 is still burning hot three years later. In 2017, Virginia was a proving ground for Democrats as they tried to translate the energy of the so-called Resistance into electoral victory. They won three statewide elections that year and dramatically exceeded expectations in legislative races, foreshadowing the party’s national triumph in recapturing the House majority in 2018. They hope the same trend will hold true heading into 2020. “This historic victory should send a chill down the spines of Donald Trump and every Republican,” proclaimed Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement. “Democrats are competing in every election and every state, running on our values, and channelling unprecedented energy into the voting booth—that’s how we won tonight, that’s how we’ll beat Trump in one year, and that’s how Democrats will win victories at every level in 2020.” It was a statement full of braggadocio, to be sure, but in Virginia, in Kentucky, and in key elections in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Democrats had the numbers to back it up. Turnout surged in big Virginia counties, just as it did in the areas around Louisville, Lexington, and south of Cincinnati, where the Democrat Andy Beshear was able to rack up the votes he needed for an apparent upset victory over the incumbent Republican governor, Matt Bevin. There were no statewide races in Virginia this year—it’s what insiders there refer to as the “off-off-year election.” But as I wrote last month, you’d never know that from watching television. With Democrats needing to flip just two seats in each legislative chamber to secure outright majorities, national progressive groups poured millions of dollars into the state, resulting in wall-to-wall ads from Labor Day on. Turnout in these legislative races has hovered around 30 percent in recent years. The state hasn’t released full turnout information from last night, but data from the largest counties, where Democrats scored their biggest wins, indicate it was close to, and in some cases more than, 40 percent. That would represent the biggest “off-off-year” turnout in more than 20 years and rival the number of votes recorded in the statewide races in 2013 and the midterm elections a year later. Read: The blue wave faces its first test after 2018 Just as in 2018, Democrats’ strength did not extend everywhere, and the overall higher turnout levels of the Trump era include rural areas where the president is inspiring his own supporters to show up for Republicans at the polls. While Democrats appear to have won the governorship in Kentucky, the GOP easily won the five other statewide races on the ballot. In Mississippi, Democrats fielded a strong gubernatorial candidate in Attorney General Jim Hood, but he could not overcome the state’s deep-red lean and lost by six points to Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, who had Trump’s backing. Turnout there did not measure up to Virginia or Kentucky. And in New Jersey, Republicans appear to have gained seats in the state legislature, including in the southern part of the state where Democrats ousted GOP House incumbents last year. Yet Virginia was where the most was at stake for Democrats nationally. The party had renewed its efforts to flip statehouses in the aftermath of Trump’s 2016 win after years of largely ceding them to Republicans. With GOP lawmakers blocking efforts at gun control following another mass shooting in Virginia Beach over the summer, groups such as Everytown added millions of dollars in spending as they fought a proxy battle with the NRA. Democrats had to overcome scandals that politically neutralized statewide leaders Governor Ralph Northam, who denied he was pictured in a blackface yearbook photo that emerged earlier this year, and Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax, who faced accusations of sexual assault from multiple women. Both men refused demands that they resign from virtually the entire Democratic Party in Virginia. “Obviously the Democratic Party had a rough start to the year,” the state party’s executive director, Chris Bolling, conceded in a call with reporters this morning. Read: The furor in Virginia has quieted By the fall, however, voters seemed to have moved on. Northam’s approval ratings rebounded, and GOP efforts to tie Democratic legislative candidates to the disgraced party leaders largely fell flat. The bigger question became whether the party could sustain the enthusiasm that had fueled its victories in 2017 and 2018. Expectations were much higher: Whereas two years ago, Democrats were happy merely to hold the governorship and make gains in the legislature, this year nothing short of outright majorities in both the state Senate and House of Delegates would count as a win. The same is true for the party nationally in 2020. Democrats will have to overcome whatever fights break out in their presidential primary and keep up their energy in driving turnout in the cities and suburbs to match Trump’s strength among cultural conservatives and rural voters. If Virginia turns out to be the bellwether Democrats hope it is—and which it proved to be two years ago—then last night’s results were a very good sign for the party.",2019-11-06 11:30:42,The Blue Wave Hasn’t Crested,"politics and government,law and legislation,elections",1110,http://www.theatlantic.com/
450,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JamesFallows/~3/IfmhBTTxYVs/,"This is the first in a series of posts on the city of Dayton, Ohio. I’ve been there three times since August and am about to make another trip. Almost every trend affecting modern America is on display in Dayton. It was one of the earliest, and hardest-hit, centers of the opioid disaster. Its economy, plausibly known as America’s “invention capital” in the early 1900s, as the home of the Wright brothers and with the highest-number of U.S. patents per capita, has been hurt even more than other midwestern cities’ by the demise and departure of big firms. Last year a PBS documentary, Left Behind America, described what happened when the Dayton-born corporation NCR, plus others, left town. The excellent recent movie American Factory (Atlantic review here) portrayed the next chapter in that story, as the Chinese automotive-glass firm Fuyao reopened a closed GM plant. The city’s population has fallen significantly from its factory-era peak. This past May, marchers from the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in town—and Klan opponents put on a bigger display. Just a few days later, a series of devastating tornados roared through the town. Then, in the first weekend of August, Dayton was of course the site of a mass shooting, a few hours after another gun massacre, in El Paso. But Dayton also has a wide variety of ambitious new projects under way. It will soon open a pioneering addiction-treatment center, in partnership with the Alphabet/Google life-sciences enterprise, Verily. The Dayton Arcade structure that was once the pride of its downtown is in the middle of a $90 million renovation project, similar to ones we have seen as centerpieces of transition in cities from Greenville, South Carolina; to Allentown, Pennsylvania; to Bend, Oregon. Dayton’s public-library and arts scenes are civic assets. The University of Dayton, a research university founded by the Catholic Marianist order and with more than 8,000 students, is opening new downtown offices and research centers. Eric Spina, an engineer who came from Syracuse to become the University of Dayton’s president three years ago, has announced a strategy of making the university “the anchor institution for the entire community,” as he put it last week at a conference in Dayton I attended called “Gem City Rising.” (Why “Gem City”? Apparently not because Dayton was ever a jewelry center. One hypothesis, relayed by the Dayton Daily News, is that some outside writer called it “the gem of all our interior [American] towns” in the 1840s.) The city’s mayor, Nan Whaley, a Democrat who is in her early 40s, was elected to the City Commission 14 years ago, while in her 20s, and is now in her second term as mayor. Deb Fallows and I have known her and followed her career for several years. She won national attention, and based on what I’ve seen wide acclaim, for her statements and appearances after the shootings in August. The exception in the admiring chorus was Donald Trump himself. While on Air Force One, headed from Dayton to El Paso, Trump began sending tweets attacking Whaley, because he felt that in a press conference she hadn’t been effusive enough about the reception he received from shooting victims he saw in the hospital. By coincidence, I was in Dayton on the August weekend of the shootings. The coincidence was aviation-related: To get back into the aerial world, I was doing flight training at Steel Aviation, based at the tiny Phillipsburg Airport just outside town, and was staying at a motel near the main Dayton International Airport. On Saturday evening, August 3, with a day’s worth of instruction behind me, I went to Dayton’s revived and thriving downtown Oregon District to walk around and, naturally, to stop in at the Dayton Beer Company to have a beer. I had just one, since I had to drive back to the motel, but I also got a to-go six-pack of their Oregon Alley IPA. (Plus, since I didn’t then know when I’d next be in town, a souvenir take-home six-pack of canned Gamma Bomb from the nearby Warped Wing brewery. ) Later that night, the Dayton mass shooter opened fire in the Oregon District. Although on-scene armed police responded within 32 seconds and killed him almost immediately, the rapid fire and large ammunition capacity of the AR-15–style rifle he brought with him allowed him to murder nine people and wound 27 others before he went down. Within 24 hours, network- and cable-news crews were on-scene in Dayton. This was the look of the Oregon District late Sunday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the killings, with one network’s crews on one side of East Fifth Street, not far from the shooting site, and another across the street: Again for aviation reasons, I was back in Dayton less than two weeks after the shootings. This time I went to Nan Whaley’s office at City Hall to ask her what it was like to be the center of cable-news attention for three or four days—and then to know that the 24/7 coverage would move on to the next breaking-news site. “This has been a really important, special part of our community,” Whaley told me about the Oregon District when I spoke with her. The district—pronounced in the Midwest as Or-e-gone, versus the West Coast pronunciation Or-uh-gun—has a beautiful residential area and small stores, but during Dayton’s economic decline was dangerous and distressed. Now it’s the site of restaurants, locally owned stores, restored homes, and the general vibe of economic improvement you find in many midwestern downtowns. Whaley said that since the shooting, she had been in touch with the mayors and other leaders of communities that had suffered similar disasters. The diversely appealing nature of the Oregon District, she said, made this shooting different from some other recent massacres. “I was talking with the mayor of Parkland [in Florida] about their high-school shooting and the mayor of Pittsburgh about the Tree of Life [synagogue] shooting,” she said. “Those were mass shootings at communities where people all belonged—they were going to school, or going to services.” By contrast, she said, the crowd in downtown Dayton was a diverse group of people who all just happened to be there for a night out (as I had happened to be there, in the same space, a few hours earlier). “This is more like the Aurora, Colorado, shooting [at a theater], where by chance people were there at the same time.” The several dozen people who were killed or injured, and the hundreds exposed to the shooting, were “a super-diverse group, with very different stories, some of them not even from the state of Ohio, and all illustrating the kind of community we have now.” “This was the place where the urban renaissance happened first in Dayton,” she said. Houses and apartments are in demand; the mix of businesses had changed from mainly bars to “the right number of bars, and restaurants and locally owned stores.” It was, she said, “a place for everybody—and in a kind of a grotesque way, the very diversity of the shooting victims showed that.” The nine people killed were black, and white; male, and female; older, and younger; from the area, and from far away. “One of them [Saeed Saleh] had grown up in Eritrea and walked across the Sahara desert—only to get here, and be killed in the Oregon District, which like all the stories was heartbreaking,” Nan Whaley said. “In a town that is still too separate and too unequal, the district represented more of what we all wanted the city to become. It’s a place for everybody.” “My concern,” she said in August, “is that the shooting stops that work and that vitality and that uniqueness.” What comes next for Dayton will be the subject of the next set of reports. “You don’t want to be known as a city where something terrible happened,” Nan Whaley told me in August—reeling off a few other names of cities now mainly identified with gun massacres. “But you don’t want what happened here just to be forgotten.” She pointed out that just two days after the killings, Donald Trump offered condolences, in comments at the White House, to “those who perished in Toledo”—one Rust Belt city apparently being hard to tell from another. “We don’t want to be a city you can’t find on the map, or even remember the name of.” And what did she hope would come of her city’s turn in the cable-news spotlight? “I would like us to be known as a place that action came out of,” she said this past summer. Before the killings in Dayton, there had been 250 mass shootings in the United States in 2019. (This is defined as four people shot, apart from the shooter.) “This made us No. 251. I think every mayor whose city has suffered this way says: ‘We’d like to be the place where something happens from our pain.’” She said, back then, that she thought the traumatic effect of the Dayton shooting might have an effect at least in Ohio’s state policies. That was the mayor’s reaction, immediately after her city’s highly publicized trauma. In upcoming installments: the longer-term efforts to revive the area’s economy, deal with addiction and related challenges, connect a divided community, and in other ways move Dayton forward. More from this series I carried on for more than a year of the coronavirus pandemic, but I didn’t see the next plague coming. After the end of the world, there will be birdsong. I used to imagine this when everything was going awry. I would lie in bed in my college dorm room and listen to the lone mockingbird who sang all night outside my window in the spring months. I was worried about something or other; he was getting on with things. It’s what birds do. They have a knack for it. In the Book of Genesis, after the devastation of the Earth by God’s cataclysmic flood, Noah releases from his ark a dove; he knows that the trial has ended when the bird does not return, having alighted somewhere out in the damp and dreary world, the first land-dwelling creature to begin the work of carrying on. What else is there to do? When COVID-19 began to spread in the United States, late in the winter of 2020, I told myself as much. In plagues, as in life, there is a morally arbitrary hierarchy of luck, and it didn’t take long for me to realize that my family and I were among the lucky ones. I was in my late 20s, hale and hearty, my husband the same plus a couple of years. Our children were young—our baby was, in fact, under a year old, something I eventually mentioned in a meekly anxious aside to a doctor I was interviewing for a story on the emerging pandemic. He acknowledged certain risks in the way that doctors do, and then said: “Don’t worry. Kids are kicking ass with this thing.” I was both comforted and chastened; this wasn’t mine to panic about. The best I could do for those in peril was to carry on. In the United States, this pandemic could be almost over by now. The reasons it’s still going are pretty clear. In the United States, this pandemic could’ve been over by now, and certainly would’ve been by Labor Day. If the pace of vaccination through the summer had been anything like the pace in April and May, the country would be nearing herd immunity. With most adults immunized, new and more infectious coronavirus variants would have nowhere to spread. Life could return nearly to normal. Experts list many reasons for the vaccine slump, but one big reason stands out: vaccine resistance among conservative, evangelical, and rural Americans. Pro-Trump America has decided that vaccine refusal is a statement of identity and a test of loyalty. In April, people in counties that Joe Biden won in 2020 were two points more likely to be fully vaccinated than people in counties that Donald Trump won: 22.8 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties; 20.6 percent were fully vaccinated in Trump counties. By early July, the vaccination gap had widened to almost 12 points: 46.7 percent were fully vaccinated in Biden counties, 35 percent in Trump counties. When pollsters ask about vaccine intentions, they record a 30-point gap: 88 percent of Democrats, but only 54 percent of Republicans, want to be vaccinated as soon as possible. All told, Trump support predicts a state’s vaccine refusal better than average income or education level. Gather friends and feed them, laugh in the face of calamity, and cut out all the things––people, jobs, body parts––that no longer serve you. “The only thing a uterus is good for after a certain point is causing pain and killing you. Why are we even talking about this?” Nora jams a fork into her chopped chicken salad, the one she insisted I order as well. “If your doctor says it needs to come out, yank it out.” Nora speaks her mind the way others breathe: an involuntary reflex, not a choice. (Obviously, all dialogue here, including my own, is recorded from the distortion field of memory.) “But the uterus …” I say, spearing a slice of egg. “It’s so …” “Symbolic?” “Yes. Don’t roll your eyes.” “I’m not rolling my eyes.” She leans in. “I’m trying to get you to face a, well, it’s not even a hard truth. It’s an easy one. Promise me the minute you leave this lunch you’ll pick up the phone and schedule the hysterectomy today. Not tomorrow. Today.” They’re not all anti-vaxxers, and treating them as such is making things worse. Last week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said that COVID-19 is “becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated.” President Joe Biden said much the same shortly after. They are technically correct. Even against the fast-spreading Delta variant, the vaccines remain highly effective, and people who haven’t received them are falling sick far more often than those who have. But their vulnerability to COVID-19 is the only thing that unvaccinated people universally share. They are disparate in almost every way that matters, including why they haven’t yet been vaccinated and what it might take to persuade them. “‘The unvaccinated’ are not a monolith of defectors,” Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician and public-health advocate in the San Francisco Bay Area, tweeted on Saturday. There’s no good way of measuring whether your vaccine worked—yet. When Kishana Taylor welcomes her twins into the world this December, she’ll be pretty confident that they won’t be carrying the virus that causes rubella, an infection that can be disastrous in infants. Thanks to a vaccine she received as a child, Taylor, a virologist at Carnegie Mellon University, is still immune to the pathogen decades later. She was able to confirm that in June through a simple test that searched her blood for antibodies that recognize the rubella virus, and then added them up. If her antibody counts were above a certain level, called a correlate of protection, she and her babies would be considered well shielded from disease. “You are considered immune with a titer of 9.9 to rubella,” she tweeted last month, referring to her antibody levels. “My titer? 116. I love my immune system sometimes.” The once-dynamic state is closing the door on economic opportunity. Behold California, colossus of the West Coast: the most populous American state; the world’s fifth-largest economy; and arguably the most culturally influential, exporting Google searches and Instagram feeds and iPhones and Teslas and Netflix Originals and kimchi quesadillas. This place inspires awe. If I close my eyes I can see silhouettes of Joshua trees against a desert sunrise; seals playing in La Jolla’s craggy coves of sun-spangled, emerald seawater; fog rolling over the rugged Sonoma County coast at sunset into primeval groves of redwoods that John Steinbeck called “ambassadors from another time.” This landscape is bejeweled with engineering feats: the California Aqueduct; the Golden Gate Bridge; and the ribbon of Pacific Coast Highway that stretches south of Monterey, clings to the cliffs of Big Sur, and descends the kelp-strewn Central Coast, where William Hearst built his Xanadu on a hillside where his zebras still graze. No dreamscape better inspires dreamers. Millions still immigrate to my beloved home to improve both their prospects and ours. Scientists are still trying to figure out what could be brewing on the planet next door. Oh, Venus. What’s going on with you? I am referring, of course, to Venus the planet, second from the sun, right next door to Earth. The planet with a furnace-like surface and clouds made of sulfuric acid, the one that shows up in our night sky as a golden jewel, and that helped prove the theory that the sun, not Earth, was at the center of the solar system. Although Venus has captivated observers for centuries, the planet remains a bit of a mystery, its particularities hidden. There’s still so much scientists want to know about our planetary neighbor. Especially now. Talk to us, Venus! The most recent, restless search for new insight began last September, when scientists announced that they had discovered evidence of a gas called phosphine floating in Venus’s clouds. It was quite the surprise: Based on what’s known about phosphine, the gas isn’t supposed to survive for very long in the planet’s atmosphere. On Earth, phosphine has been found in the intestines of animals, us included, and in swampy communities of microorganisms. The group of scientists concluded that something must be replenishing Venus’s supply—perhaps a mysterious Venusian life-form. In 1955, just past daybreak, a Chevrolet truck pulled up to an unmarked building. A 14-year-old child was in the back.  This article was published online on July 22, 2021. The dentist was a few minutes late, so I waited by the barn, listening to a northern mockingbird in the cypress trees. His tires kicked up dust when he turned off Drew Ruleville Road and headed across the bayou toward his house. He got out of his truck still wearing his scrubs and, with a smile, extended his hand: “Jeff Andrews.” The gravel crunched under his feet as he walked to the barn, which is long and narrow with sliding doors in the middle. Its walls are made of cypress boards, weathered gray, and it overlooks a swimming pool behind a white columned house. Jeff Andrews rolled up the garage door he’d installed. Our eyes adjusted to the darkness of the barn where Emmett Till was tortured by a group of grown men. Christmas decorations leaned against one wall. Within reach sat a lawn mower and a Johnson 9.9-horsepower outboard motor. Dirt covered the spot where Till was beaten, and where investigators believe he was killed. Andrews thinks he was strung from the ceiling, to make the beating easier. The truth is, nobody knows exactly what happened in the barn, and any evidence is long gone. Andrews pointed to the central rafter. A newish wave of sophisticated, adult board games have made exploitation part of their game mechanics. A reckoning is coming. The board game “Puerto Rico” begins after everyone around the table receives a mat printed with the verdant interior of the game’s namesake island. Players are cast as European tycoons who have trekked across the Atlantic at the height of the Age of Exploration. “In 1493 Christopher Columbus discovered the easternmost island of the Great Antilles,” read the back of the game box that once sat on my living-room shelf. “About 50 years later, Puerto Rico began to really blossom.” To win, one must “achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect.” In practice, that means the mechanics of “Puerto Rico” are centered around cultivation, exploitation, and plunder. Each turn, a player takes a role—the “settler,” the “builder,” the “trader,” the “craftsman,” the “captain,” and so on—and tries to slowly transform their tropical enclave into a tidy, 16th-century imperial settlement. Perhaps they uproot the wilds and replace them with tobacco pastures or corn acreage, or maybe they outfit the rocky reefs with fishing wharfs and harbors, in order to ship those goods back across the ocean. All of this is possible only with the help of a resource that the game calls “colonists,” —represented by small, brown discs in the game’s first edition, which was published by Rio Grande Games and is available in major retailers—who arrive by ship and are sent by players to work on their plantations. During the pandemic, hungry Costa Ricans have been resorting to an illegal practice that was once on the decline. Miguel Torres spends most of his nights playing a game of cat and mouse. Along with seven colleagues, Torres, a wildlife-refuge patrolman, conducts hourly sweeps around Ostional Beach in northwestern Costa Rica, looking for sea-turtle poachers. The key to winning this game, Torres says, is to be as dark as possible. If poachers see you on your phone at the patrol post, they know the coast is clear. If you use your flashlight too much, you give away your position. Torres flashes his light only when his well-trained eyes see a shadow that’s out of place. That flash is usually enough to send poachers fleeing. And on April 15, 2021, at about midnight, Torres and a colleague came upon three suspicious shadows where the jungle meets the beach. Brandishing his flashlight, he saw two of them bolt into the night. The third shadow remained, squirming in the darkness. I carried on for more than a year of the coronavirus pandemic, but I didn’t see the next plague coming. After the end of the world, there will be birdsong.

Mike DeWine's recently introduced gun package? The editorial board roundtable offers its perspective. (Michael Lloyd/The Oregonian)LC- The Oregonian How things change, yet don’t seem to change when it comes to gun laws in Ohio. Last year, following high-profile mass shootings, then-Gov. John Kasich introduced a package of compromise gun laws, the product of a bipartisan advisory panel. Companion House and Senate measures were introduced and referred to committee -- where they died without a single vote. By contrast, a “stand your ground” bill received seven hearings before it was passed by the Ohio House. In the Senate, House Bill 228 was eventually amended to remove its “stand your ground” language. That followed a threatened veto from Kasich and a backlash for then-House Speaker Ryan Smith’s decision to kill the mic as Cleveland Rep. Stephanie Howse, who is African-American, tried to speak about the nearly all-white constituents of the bill’s sponsors and of its negative impact on communities of color. Kasich vetoed HB 228 anyway, then both chambers overrode his veto in a post-Christmas vote on Dec. 27. Scroll ahead to 2019. After the deadly Dayton shooting in August, Gov. Mike DeWine promised to “do something.” The legislation introduced this fall was somewhat less than promised but, as our editorial board judged, would still yield significant benefits if passed. Yet there was no House measure introduced and Senate Bill 221 has so far attracted a grand total of three sponsors. And then, “stand your ground” resurfaced in the House, co-sponsored by state Rep. Candice Keller of southwest Ohio -- the same lawmaker Ohio GOP chairman Jane Timken had called on to resign last summer after Keller blamed the Dayton killings on “drag queen advocates,” gay marriage and “recreational marijuana.” As of earlier this week, House Bill 381 had 24 sponsors. DeWine has hedged on HB 381, saying he hadn’t seen the legislation. But state Sen. Matt Dolan of Chagrin Falls, chief sponsor of SB 221, DeWine’s legislative gun package, wasn’t so noncommittal. He told Ohio Public Radio that passage of “stand your ground” within months of the Ohio mass shooting would be “tone deaf to the feelings that are out there.” So should DeWine oppose HB 381? Can the governor’s gun reform proposals even pass in Ohio or is it the fate of gun reform to die at the Ohio Statehouse? The editorial board roundtable offers its thoughts. Jarvis DeBerry, cleveland.com columnist: If Ohio’s lawmakers pass a “stand your ground” law – which grants the permission to shoot without thought of retreating – then they should go the grave of John Crawford and share the good news. Go tell the black man killed for innocently holding an air rifle that encouraging more deadly gun fire is the policy change Ohio needs. Ted Diadiun, cleveland.com columnist: Yes, the legislature should pass DeWine’s red-flag and background check proposals – not that either would prevent mass shootings. That’s got nothing to do with allowing people to defend themselves without running afoul of the law. The onus should be on the attacker, and not the person who has to decide when and whether to retreat without being killed. Thomas Suddes, editorial writer: Passage by the Ohio General Assembly of House Bill 381 -- the “hurray for gunplay” bill -- would embarrass Ohio nationwide. Lisa Garvin, editorial board member: Gov. DeWine and the legislature are headed in opposite directions on gun control with no middle ground in sight. Will the governor capitulate to lawmakers determined to pass “stand your ground” and “constitutional carry” legislation that could lead to more tragic mistakes like the murder of Botham Jean, or will he do the right thing? Ohioans are watching. Victor Ruiz, editorial board member: Republicans’ timing around this gun legislation adds insult to injury and is insensitive to the families who’ve experienced gun violence. While I understand that, politically, Ohio “bleeds red,” and that sensible gun reform isn’t on the horizon, at a minimum, we need to show respect for lives lost and have a discussion on how to end these types of tragedies. Mary Cay Doherty, editorial board member: This isn’t an “either-or.” DeWine’s STRONG Ohio bill and the proposed “stand your ground” legislation both aim to protect Ohioans. STRONG Ohio limits gun access for people who threaten the safety of others. And “stand your ground” allows Ohioans to defend themselves against those threats. Careful drafting is key, but the General Assembly should “do something” with both bills. Eric Foster, editorial board member: I wrote a column about Ohio’s gun-reform problem back in August. We, the people, know that gun reform has to happen. Yet, despite that common knowledge, we do not act on it by electing politicians with the courage to act. If the best the Ohio House can do after the Dayton shooting is introduce HB 381, the House needs new membership. Elizabeth Sullivan, director of opinion, cleveland.com: Gov. DeWine needs to exert his leadership forcefully if he wants his gun package to pass as a credible response to Dayton. That means saying no to Ohio 'stand your ground"" legislation that’s little more than an invitation to kill. Have something to say about this topic? * Use the comments to share your thoughts.

452,https://time.com/5735415/woke-culture-political-companies/,"For decades, most companies went to great lengths to avoid opining on social issues. No longer. After a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August, the retailer said it would stop selling ammunition for military-style assault rifles. Patagonia closed its offices and stores for part of the day on Sept. 20 so employees could participate in a global climate strike. And in November, Chick-fil-A, which has come under fire for supporting Christian organizations that oppose same-sex marriage, said it would stop donating to those groups. What’s changed? Frustrated with political gridlock, consumers have turned to business for leadership. “I think business has to pick up the mantle when governments fail you,” Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario told TIME earlier this year. Young consumers are also more likely to patronize brands whose business models claim to include social change. Nine in 10 members of Generation Z, who account for as much as $150 billion in spending power globally, believe that companies have a responsibility to social and environmental issues, according to McKinsey. In an age when companies have detailed information on customers’ ages, incomes and political persuasions, they’re calculating that these socially aware consumers are more lucrative than those who might be put off by social-justice campaigns. “In a politically polarized world that is saturated in social media, you’re not going to escape politics,” says Jerry Davis, a professor of management and sociology at the University of Michigan. “This is a sea change–in the past, companies kept their heads down and did their best to never be seen.” Companies are also trying to make their politics more appealing to Generation Z as they try to recruit young workers. Last year, after thousands of employees demanded that Google not work with any entity building “warfare technology,” Google decided not to renew a contract with the Pentagon. In September, after Amazon employees planned a walkout to call attention to the company’s lack of leadership on environmental issues, Jeff Bezos released a climate pledge. “Woke capitalism” started picking up steam early last year. After the Parkland school shooting, Delta joined a dozen or so companies in ending discounts for NRA members, even after the state of Georgia threatened to take away nearly $40 million in state tax breaks on fuel the airline received. That September, Nike released an ad featuring Colin Kaepernick telling customers to “believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything,” a show of support for the former NFL quarterback who, after kneeling during the national anthem to draw attention to racial injustice, was not signed to a team. In November, Blake Mycoskie, founder of Toms shoes, announced the largest-ever corporate gift–$5 million–to groups working to end gun violence. Not every customer, or cohort, has welcomed the shift. In April 2016, for instance, the retailer Target faced a backlash after releasing a statement saying that customers and staff could use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender identity. Christian groups called for a boycott; a pastor said the company was opening the door for “perverts and pedophiles”; and some customers said they would switch to Amazon and Walmart. Still, companies are learning that it may be riskier to pretend it’s all business as usual. After the Washington Post reported that Stephen Ross, an investor in Equinox and SoulCycle, was hosting a fundraiser for President Trump, customers urged a boycott. Although SoulCycle said Ross was a “passive investor,” attendance at SoulCycle classes decreased significantly in September and October from the same period last year, according to Earnest Research. When the NBA tried to walk back a tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting protesters in Hong Kong, fans in the U.S. mocked the league for valuing the Chinese market more than democracy. The NBA quickly pivoted. At the TIME 100 Health Summit in October, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he hadn’t intended the initial response to read as a condemnation of Morey’s words. “Maybe I was trying too hard to be a diplomat,” he said.

Almost four months after a deadly shooting that killed 22 people in an El Paso, Texas, Walmart, employees are heading back to business as usual. The Walmart where the shooting took place on August 3 reopened on Thursday after being closed for more than three months. ""It's time to move forward and go back to normal and serving our customers,"" Walmart employee Gilbert Serna wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Serna became known as a hero after he told CNN that he helped dozens of people to safety during the shooting. Serna has worked at that Walmart store for almost 19 years, CNN reported. In a Wednesday Facebook post, Serna described the resilience of the Walmart employees who ""consciously decided that tragedy wasn't going to get the better of them."" He recounted his story to various media outlets. ""They were scared. I was scared,"" he told BuzzFeed News. ""We were all scared."" At the store's reopening ceremony, a banner with the hashtag #ElPasoStrong was unveiled on the side of the building, and employees and locals cheered and applauded as the doors opened, CNN reported. Store manager Robert Evans told the El Paso Times on Thursday that he felt that reopening the store was beneficial to employees and customers. ""I really think that the ideal outcome is obviously to continue, to continue the healing process,"" Evans told the El Paso Times. A Walmart spokesperson said that the store had been updated and renovated in various ways, including adding new signs in the store, repaving the parking lot, and repainting the exterior. ""We are grateful to be part of such an incredible community that when faced with tragedy has responded with unity, compassion and love,"" Todd Peterson, Walmart's vice president and regional general manager, said in a statement in advance of the opening. ""Over the last several weeks, our associates have been helping prepare store 2201 for opening and, as a reflection of the strength and resiliency of the El Paso community, the Cielo Vista Walmart will re-open to customers on Thurs. Nov. 14 at 9:00 a.m.""",2019-11-14 20:29:15,Walmart store in El Paso where shooting happened reopens - Business Insider,murders and attempted murders,18710,http://www.businessinsider.com
