As bomb squad chief in the western port city of Malmo, Mansson has been busy with a dozen grenade attacks in the last few months. They have shocked a Nordic country that prides itself on safety, led to worries criminality is out of control and given political fodder to a resurgent far-right that blames immigrant gangs for the violence. “It is strange to be doing almost the same in Malmo that I was doing in Iraq,” Mansson said at his headquarters where unexploded grenades – manufactured in ex-Yugoslavia – were neatly lined up on his desk. The attacks, as well as other bombs placed in cars and parks, have wounded two people this year but not killed anyone. The pattern of targets – from flats to offices and one building housing a Ramadan celebration – appears random. No one has been arrested. The best guess, experts say, is a gang turf war that could easily see fatalities as tit-for-tat attacks spiral. Iraqi-born Ghanem Almanei described the attack on the Ramadan celebration, attended by some 50 people. “It was a really big bomb. It was women, girls inside.” said Almanei, his voice shaking, half-an-hour after men on motor bikes threw a grenade against the building. “I don’t feel safe now in this country.” These incidents have focused attention on gang-related violence in one of Sweden’s most segregated cities where unemployment rates top 40 percent in some deprived, mainly immigrant areas. The bomb and grenade attacks – in six months already near the total level of 2014 – came the same year as a mass shooting in the nearby city of Gothenburg. Two masked men opened fire in a bar, killing two and wounding at least 10 people. “These attacks are creating terror and it plays into the hand of the far right” said Joakim Palmkvist, a Swedish journalist and author of Mafia War. “The general effect is scaring the public to an extent that has been unknown before.” While most Swedes are open to immigrants, the far right Sweden Democrats became the third biggest party in parliament in last year’s election, in part by demanding a clampdown on immigration and crime. “This (wave of grenade attacks) is because we have segregation in Sweden and most of it is in Malmo,” said Jorgen Grubb, Sweden Democrats chairman in Malmo. “It’s always people from other countries that do these things. What Malmo needs is to put up a red stop sign.” But the city’s most infamous killer was Swedish-born – Peter Mangs was arrested in 2010 for three murders and 13 attempted murders over a seven-year period, a string of shootings in Malmo targeting immigrants. Smuggling Hub Sweden With a population of just 300,000, Malmo has long been a smuggling hub due its closeness to Denmark, with which it has been connected by a bridge to Copenhagen since 2000. Around a third of the city’s population are immigrants – double the national average, and nearly one in three is unemployed. Among young immigrants, the rate is nearly 40 percent – Somalis, Iraqis, Bosnians and Iranians squeezed into concrete tenement blocks. Gangs began here decades ago as motorcycle groups and were increasingly dominated by immigrants, thanks to an influx in the 1990s of refugees of Balkan wars and then immigrants from the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe. It is this mixture of poverty, joblessness and immigrants that has given Malmo a reputation as Sweden’s roughest city – what some newspapers have called Sweden’s “Chicago”. Most grenades have been smuggled from the Balkans to Malmo, a gateway to the rest of Scandinavia for drugs and arms. The leader of one main gang is said to be a Serbian who came to Sweden as a refugee in the 1990s. Palmkvist says grenades can be bought in the black market for a little as 70 dollars each. “Terror is not just about a lone gunman,” author Palmkvist said, referring to attacks by a 22-year-old man on a synagogue and free speech event in Copenhagen – a short car ride across a bridge from Malmo – that killed two people in February. “Terror is also about a lot grenades being thrown.” The city’s main mosque has suffered several arson attacks. Jewish groups have warned of growing anti-Semitic attacks. Two schools were closed this year due to violence among students. With its street cafes and gentrifying old port, Malmo still seems a picture of Swedish prosperity. In the poorest districts, carefully tended gardens and children’s parks compare favourably with some of Europe’s inner cities. But that has not stopped a sense of fear in the city. “I feel very concerned. I have a daughter who is growing up here,” said Kristin Lidgren, who works with a theatre group. “The danger is young people take this way of criminal life as normal.” With no arrests after the recent attacks, local media have criticised police for being undermanned as officers head to the beach, underscoring what some argue is complacency and resignation on the part of the authorities. “It’s the summer and many police are on holidays.” said Palmkvist. “Welcome to Sweden.” London / EuropeMalmoSweden .

Conley, who has a violent criminal history, entered a Houston home through an unlocked window and fatally shot a woman he'd previously dated, her husband and six children, including a boy believed to be his own son, authorities said. He is charged with capital murder in the deaths (AP Photo/David J. Phillip) David Ray Conley III, 49, is charged with multiple counts of capital murder, was ordered held without bail in the deaths of six children and two adults. Harris County Sheriffs Office deputies investigate after finding eight people dead inside a home in the 2200 block of Falling Oaks Road, Sunday, August 9, in Houston. Three adults and five children are dead, and a 49-year old male suspect surrendered. Wendy Antonio (left-right), Carlos Sanchez, Valerie Perdomo and Thania Perdomo brought flowers and offered prayer at a memorial outside of the home of Valerie Jackson, 2211 Falling Oak, where 6 children and two adults were murdered Saturday night. ""I don't want to cry anymore"" Antonio said Monday, Aug. 10, 2015, in Houston. Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said Monday that seeking the death penalty for a Houston man accused of killing six children and two adults is a ""no-brainer."" ""After we have indicted the defendant for capital murder, then (prosecutors and investigators) begin investigating him for the decision whether to seek death, so we're talking about a span of three to four months before that decision will be made,"" she said. ""On the face of it, it seems like a no-brainer, but we take a lot into consideration."" Dressed in the yellow jail uniform of a high-profile inmate, David Ray Conley, 48, appeared before state District Judge Vanessa Velasquez who heard the allegations behind three capital murder charges. Conley was arrested after surrendering to sheriff's deputies late Saturday night following a police standoff outside a house in northwest Harris County. Authorities said he had broken in through a window, armed and with handcuffs, and methodically shot his estranged ex-girlfriend Valerie Jackson, her husband and six children, including his own son, one by one in the head. All eight died in the house. Authorities identified the dead as Valerie Jackson, 40, Jonah Jackson, 6; Trinity Jackson, 7; Caleb Jackson, 9; Dwayne Jackson Jr., 10; Honesty Jackson, 11; Nathaniel Conley, 13; and Dwayne Jackson, 50. Prosecutors said Valerie Jackson texted her mother that she was being held at gunpoint. Anderson said Valerie Jackson's mother then did what any mother would do from four states away — she called 911. ""My heart goes out to the mother who received the text from her daughter that she was in trouble,"" she said. ""She was able to get a text off to her mom, saying she was being held at gunpoint."" READ MORE: Details of suspect's relationship with victims emerge Conley, who has an extensive criminal record, has looked across the courtroom to see Anderson at least once before. In 2000, Valerie Jackson filed charges of assault against Conley. Because of his earlier record, Conley faced 25 years to life in prison. Another prosecutor handled the case, which lingered on the docket about two years before Anderson approved a plea deal sentencing Conley to five years behind bars. The case fell apart before trial when Jackson recanted, first saying Conley did not do it, then accusing an ex-boyfriend of the crime. Photos: Memorial appears at site of Falling Oaks massacre In a mandatory memo to Conley's defense attorney about exculpatory evidence, prosecutors outlined that Jackson changed her story at least twice. Prosecutors also told the defense that she had been convicted of prostitution three times in 2001 and trespassing in 1995. She was also involved in court proceedings in other counties for bail jumping, theft of service and check forging, for which she apparently received probation, court records show. At the time, she had open warrants for theft and bail jumping in Wisconsin. Conley had filed a police report against Jackson before the assault, alleging that she took his car.""It appears we took the plea deal because the complainant recanted her story numerous times,"" said DA spokesman Jeff McShan. ""She even came to court to recant.""  RELATED: Weekend killings hold a grim spot in Houston's history On Monday, Anderson compared the tragedy to the mass shooting last year in Spring that killed six members of the Stay family, including four children. ""I didn't think the Stay family case could be beat,"" Anderson said. ""I didn't ever think we'd see anything as horrifying as that, and we have now."" Stephen Stay, 39; his wife, Katie, 34; and their children, were slain in an execution-style shooting in July 2014 when, authorities allege, a former member of their extended family came searching for his ex-wife, who was not in the home. Ron Haskell, then 33, disguised himself as a FedEx delivery man, forced his way into the home, tied up family members, then shot them, investigators said. The oldest daughter, then-15-year-old Cassidy Stay, survived a gunshot wound and called authorities. Haskell remains in the Harris County jail on charges of capital murder. Anderson said Conley's case will be handled by prosecutors Alycia Harvey and Marie Primm.""He killed an entire family,"" Harvey said after the brief hearing. ""He killed a husband, a wife and their children."" She would not speculate on a motive for the alleged capital murder. Conley will remain in jail without bail, the judge ruled Monday. Meanwhile, scrawls of children's chalk in blue, white and pink adorned the concrete driveway and wooden fence at the home where the massacre took place. ""Caleb,"" the name of a 9-year-old victim is written on the driveway beside several hearts. Neighbors aren't sure how long it had been there, as the children were always playing in the front yard and drawing with chalk. A memorial of candles, flowers and children's toys including bicycles, stuffed animals and sports gear was growing bigger by the hour Monday as well wishers came and went from the home's front porch. The names of the eight victims were written on yellow Post It notes stuck to a piece of white poster board: Nate, Dwayne Jr, Trinity, Jonah, Caleb, Honesty, Dwayne and Valerie their mother. There were also notes from the children's friends. ""I really miss you Dwayne. You are my best boy,"" says one. ""I hope to see you again if that really wasn't your body."" Another note was stuck to the top of a box of sneakers. ""These are the shoes you wanted bro,"" it reads. ""I love and miss you.""  Brian Rogers covers Houston crime and courts.

According to Santa Cruz Police and FBI investigators, Gonzallez allegedly lured Middleton into his family's neighboring Tannery Arts Center apartment, where he raped and murdered her, then dumping her body into a recycling bin in the garage beneath the apartmetn complex. He is pictured here in front of the Tannery Arts Center apartments where he and Maddy Middleton lived. FAIR USE - DO NOT CROP/MM  Adrian Jerry Gonzalez, the 15 year-old accussed killer of eight year-old Madyson Middleton, enters Judge Timothy Volkmann's courtroom Thursday morning flanked by Public Defender Larry Biggam and attorney Leila Sayer. (Dan Coyro -- Santa Cruz Sentinel)  SANTA CRUZ — Investigators are exploring potential links between Madyson Middleton murder defendant A.J. Gonzalez and a shooting threat against Santa Cruz High School in November. Gonzalez, 15, is accused of killing 8-year-old Madyson at the Tannery Arts Center in Santa Cruz on July 26. Gonzalez referred to “crippling anxiety” on Instagram posts before his arrest, and that phrase matched a comment made by the person who claimed responsibility a November shooting threat at Santa Cruz High. Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said police are aware of the language similarities. He did not confirm or deny whether Gonzalez is a suspect in the shooting threat. “Right now, our focus is on completing the homicide investigation for Madyson,” Clark said Aug. 4. Classes at Santa Cruz High were canceled Nov. 19 after someone emailed the school’s principal and threatened a mass shooting. Police and school leaders decided to close the school for a day and no one was injured. That week, a Sentinel reporter was contacted anonymously through Twitter and email by someone who said they attended the school and made the threat “simply for the thrill.” The person had the specific wording of the original threat email to the principal, which police had not released publicly. Police confirmed then that the wording matched. The person also contacted Santa Cruz police through anonymous emails, but was never arrested in part because the emails were bounced off overseas computer servers through a Tor network, which makes them harder to trace. In emails, the person who contacted the Sentinel said he was wracked with guilt about the shooting threat and had “crippling” anxiety. During the past two years, Gonzalez posted pictures and captions on Instagram using the handle @AwkwardYoYoer and also referenced “crippling anxiety.” In 2013, when Gonzalez was in middle school, he sent a Facebook message to a friend that said, “Something big is going to happen in high school.” The friend told the Sentinel that Gonzalez often said he was depressed and was sometimes suicidal. In the fall of 2014, Gonzalez was a freshman at Santa Cruz High. The person who contacted the Sentinel after the shooting threat said he was 16 and a sophomore, but he later said he lied and was actually a junior. Monday, Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s Office spokesman Paul Mangasarian said prosecutors could not say whether they too were exploring links between Gonzalez and the school shooting threat. District Attorney Jeff Rosell did not return calls seeking comment. “At this point we’re being pretty conservative with the information we’re putting out there on this case,” Mangasarian said. Meanwhile, two weeks after Maddy’s death, officials involved with the case have not yet released the girl’s cause and manner of death, typically a routine item. Santa Cruz County Coroner’s Office spokesman Lt. Kelly Kent said Santa Cruz police issued a hold on the information, while police officials deferred all media questions to the Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s Office. Previously, Rosell said his office would not typically release that type of information, but has not responded to several follow-up calls. Santa Cruz police ask anyone with information to call investigations at 831-420-5820, the anonymous tip line at 831-420-5995 or leave a tip at www.santacruzpolice.com or by the mobile application at m.santacruzpolice.com.

6,http://www.chron.com/opinion/letters/article/Wednesday-letters-Protecting-families-Iran-Ray-6438597.php,"Protect families  Regarding ""8 dead in family massacre"" (Page A1, Monday), I was sick to my stomach after learning the horrific details of yet another mass shooting that claimed the lives of eight people - six of them children - in Houston. A man with a violent and criminal past broke into his ex-girlfriend's home, handcuffed everyone inside, and shot them execution-style in their bedrooms. If you think shootings of this nature are rare, think again: This is the ninth domestic mass shooting in Texas since 2009. Saturday's tragedy occurred just miles from a similar shooting nearly one year ago in Spring - my hometown - when a man shot and killed six people, including four children. The national media tends to publicize mass shootings that are ""random"" by nature. But it is extremely important to take note that most mass shootings are tied to domestic abuse. Everytown for Gun Safety published an analysis of mass shootings from 2009 to 2014 that revealed that in 57 percent of mass shootings, the shooters killed intimate partners or other family members. And while these tragedies keep tallying up, our state's elected officials have done nothing to curb gun violence. For the members of the Texas Legislature, I have one question: Are you going to continue to cater to the gun lobby agenda of more guns in more places, no questions asked, or are you going to step up to protect our Texas women and families by working harder to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and other dangerous people? Texas Moms anxiously are awaiting your answer. Stephanie Lundy, member Texas Chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  Focus on Iran deal Regarding ""Iran nuke agreement may survive despite Democrat defections"" (Page A7, Saturday), President Obama has made many factually inaccurate statements in his arguments in support of the Iran agreement. For example, Obama has claimed that the people who oppose the Iran agreement are the same people who favored the Iraq war. This is not true. All the following oppose the Iran agreement, but none supported the Iraq war: Christians United for Israel, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Congress, Hadassah, B'nai Brith, Houston Jewish Federation and many other local Jewish Federations across the country. Argumentative misstatements of the facts should not divert attention from the many deficiencies and weaknesses in the Iran agreement. Those deficiencies and weaknesses should be the focus of our attention. Melvin Dow, Houston  Ethics, morals and NFL Regarding ""Skip the piousness and give Rice a call"" (Page C1, Monday), this is the issue: winning at all costs, and to hell with ethics and morals. Perhaps Ray Rice could do better by finishing his education and helping others beat the cycle of domestic violence. This job (the NFL) is of a high enough profile and pay grade that only those of the highest athletic, ethical and moral character should be considered.

One point, however, that I found missing was that there is a vaccine available to fight against HPV. It is suggested that every child have this vaccine, not just the females. I hope more people become aware that this is available and that in the future, we will see a reduction in cervical cancer cases. Rita Dumaine, Sugar Land  Massacres and guns Regarding ""8 dead in family massacre"" (Page A1, Monday), another week, another mass shooting. This time, in Houston. A man with a violent criminal history - which prohibited him from possessing a gun - broke into his ex-girlfriend's home, handcuffed the eight people inside - including six kids, and shot and killed them. How could the shooter get a gun if he was prohibited from owning one? Had he attempted to buy a gun from a licensed gun dealer, he would have been denied. But because Texas and 31 other states allow guns to be sold online and at gun shows with no criminal background check required, criminals have an easy avenue to arm themselves, with no questions asked. David Ray Conley is far from the first criminal to scour the online market for guns. Mayors Against Illegal Guns research has shown that 1 in 30 gun buyers online is prohibited from owning guns because of a criminal record. So what can be done to make Texas safer? Closing the background check loophole that this shooter exploited would be a good place to start. In states that require background checks on all handgun sales, 46 percent fewer women are shot to death by intimate partners. Saturday's shooting deaths are just the latest example of what can happen when a criminal gets hold of a gun. If you're tired of reading about domestic mass shootings - Texas has had nine of them in the past six years - join me in demanding our lawmakers require background checks on all gun sales. Cathy Nance, Houston  Gather all affected parties Regarding ""Reform called for in permit process"" (Page B1, Thursday), so it is nice to hear that all the mayoral candidates want to make the business permitting process as smooth as possible. However, what I failed to read was how they all feel about making certain that the concerns of the neighbors of businesses also get addressed in a fair and equitable way. Accelerating the permitting process without also ensuring that neighborhood concerns are addressed seems to me to be a recipe for a lot of conflict, including lawsuits. Let's try to get all the parties on board. Alan Jackson, Houston  Presidential treatment Regarding ""Carter says he has cancer that has spread"" (Page A1, Thursday), having practiced medicine for more than 30 years, I guarantee that I would think long and hard about offering a 90-year-old with widely metastatic cancer anything but comfort care. No matter who he is, this gentleman should be informed of his option to spend his remaining months enjoying his family instead of suffering the side effects of treatment.

11,http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/District-judge-withdraws-amends-order-gagging-6444454.php,"A Harris County district judge on Friday amended her sweeping gag order in the David Conley capital murder case, which, among other restrictions, had sought to limit media outlets from writing or commenting about his trial. Authorities say Conley slipped into the northwest Harris County home of his ex-girlfriend on Saturday and then executed her along with her husband and six of her children. He is in jail without bail. In  jailhouse interviews with local media outlets, including the Houston Chronicle, he has spoken about his relationship with Valerie Jackson, which whom he had two children, one of whom was among the slain. On Wednesday, Vanessa Velasquez, judge in the 183rd district court, issued a gag order requested by lawyers for  Conley.  The order, among other things, barred the news media ""from conducting or attempting to conduct an interview with David Conley outside of the presence of his counsel."" On Friday, she withdrew the order, which had been roundly criticized by local media outlets and which also prohibited courtroom broadcasting, photography and sketches. Other restrictions included barring the ""pre-trial publication of any witness accounts which identify the defendant as having committed the alleged crime."" It also sought to restrict the reporting and commenting of the case to the facts introduced at Conley's trial. Conley's defense attorney, Loretta Muldrow, had asked for the order because the case was likely to receive ""the concentrated attention of the news media"" and ""it can be expected that the community will be exposed to massive dosages of pre-trial and trial publicity and reports concerning the facts of the case and the defendant's implication therein."" The amended order bars lawyers, law enforcement and witnesses who gave statements to police or who end up testifying at trial from speaking to the media and bars witnesses at a future competency hearing from speaking with reporters. In the amended order, Velasquez wrote she was ""mindful of the First Amendment rights of the parties, counsel for the parties, the media, as well as the Open Courts Provision of the Texas Constitution,"" but said the attention the case had received could interfere with Conley's right to a fair trial. It also withdraws elements of the previous order which had appeared to try to limit reporters' coverage of the case and what they published. Read the full order above.

A Jindal campaign spokesperson calls the New Orleans mayor's efforts to remove Confederate monuments, including one dedicated to a white supremacist insurrection, ""political correctness run amok."" By
      
        John Stanton Posted on August 14, 2015, at 4:30 p.m. ET WASHINGTON — Republican Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's presidential campaign Thursday defended his plan to block New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu's efforts to remove statues to confederate soldiers — including one which celebrates a white supremacist insurrection that left 32 people dead, including a number of police officers. On Thursday, Jindal's administration said the governor is looking into legal authorities to block Landrieu, and his campaign spokesperson accused Landrieu and his supporters of ""political correctness."" ""The Governor opposes tearing down these historical statues and has instructed his staff to look into all relevant laws to determine the legal authority we have to stop it. We need to preserve our history to remember what we've learned and how far we've come,"" spokesperson Shannon Dirmann told BuzzFeed News. ""This is political correctness run amok. What's next? Maybe we can edit our history books too, and then burn all the books we disagree with."" Last month Landrieu proposed removing three statues from New Orleans public property that celebrated the Confederacy, as well as a memorial to the Battle of Liberty Place, the 1874 white supremacist insurrection against the integrated reconstruction-era government. ""The monuments were erected at a time when supremacy was the order of the day,"" Landrieu told the City Council as part of the announcement. ""But a lot has changed since the Civil War. Supremacy is a part of our past. But it should not be part of our future."" Efforts to remove monuments to the Confederacy, which began in earnest following the July mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, have been controversial amongst some segments of the South. But the Battle of Liberty Place is unique in that it specifically celebrates the efforts of white supremacists to overthrow the post-war government. The monument hails the efforts of white supremacists to overthrow the ""usurpers"" and notes that while ""United States troops took over the state government and reinstated the usurpers … the national election of 1876 recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state."" The Confederacy lost its four-year bid to maintain slavery in 1865 when it was defeated by the United States. Landrieu spokesman Brad Howard did not comment directly on Jindal's decision, saying in an email that ""Mayor Landrieu called for a 60-day period of public discussion to encourage opportunities for people to respectfully engage in public discussion about these statues … It is important that all those who are interested have an opportunity to share their perspective and opinion about this issue.""

In July, a gunman killed himself after killing two at a screening of Trainwreck in Lafayette, Louisiana. Earlier this month, in Nashville, Tennessee, a man was shot and killed at a showing of Mad Max: Fury Road, after he attacked moviegoers with pepper spray and a hatchet. Both events occurred in the wake of James Holmes’s 2012 shooting rampage, that took the life of 12 people and injured 70 more, during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado. He was sentenced to life in prison last week. “Security issues have become a daily part of our lives in America. Regal Entertainment Group wants our customers and staff to feel comfortable and safe when visiting or working in our theatres,” the chain said in a statement. Regal acknowledged that this new procedure is not without its flaws, but that it hopes they’re “minor in comparison to increased safety”. The chain, based in Knoxville, Tennessee, is the first to institute a bag check policy. Up until now, the exhibition industry has been largely silent on security measures. In the wake of the two most recent attacks on movie theaters, Variety reports that nearly half of ticket buyers are willing to pay more to improve security measures via the costly installation of metal detectors, and hiring of armed security guards. According to a new survey conducted by consumer research film C4, following the Nashville incident, 48% of moviegoers are willing to pay $1 or more per ticket for the additional measures. Nineteen per cent of respondents said they would pay $3 or more. Last weekend, Universal Pictures partnered with exhibitors that requested support during screenings of Straight Outta Compton, the hit drama that centres on gangsta rap group NWA.",2015-08-19 18:50:31,America's largest movie theater chain adds bag check policy,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Alabama, has released the first quantitative analysis of public mass shootings around the world between 1966 through 2012. Unsurprisingly, the United States came out on top—essentially in a league of its own. Over those five decades, the United States had 90 public mass shootings, defined as shootings that killed four or more victims. Of the 170 other countries examined in the study, only four even made it to double-digits: The Philippines had 18 public mass shootings, followed by Russia with 15, Yemen with 11, and France with 10. Mass shooters in the United States stood out from those in other countries in a few ways. Compared with attackers abroad, Americans were more than three times as likely to use multiple weapons, and they tended to target schools, factories, and office buildings. (Shooters in other countries were more likely to strike at military bases and checkpoints.) But shootings in the United States often killed fewer people than attacks overseas: On average, 6.9 victims died in each mass shooting incident on American soil, compared with 8.8 victims for each shooting in other countries. That may be because American police officers have been trained to respond more quickly to these situations and are often heavily armed, Lankford suggests. The study drew largely on data from the New York City Police Department and the FBI. It did not consider gang-related or drive-by shootings, as well as hostage-taking incidents, robberies, and shootings in domestic settings. Lankford suggests America’s high rate of public mass shootings is connected with the number of guns circulating in the country. “A nation’s civilian firearm ownership rate is the strongest predictor of its number of public mass shooters,” he explained in a statement, noting that the United States, Yemen, Switzerland, Finland, and Serbia, which are among the top 15 countries for mass shooters per capita, also rank in the top five countries for firearms per capita, according to the 2007 Small Arms Survey. But the number of guns in circulation might be less important than ease of access to them. As my colleague Mark Follman has reported, most mass shooters in the United States obtained their weapons legally.

August 24, 2015 Colorado movie massacre gunman James Holmes will be sentenced to life with no chance of parole at a three-day hearing that begins on Monday following his conviction last month for murdering 12 people and wounding 70 in his rampage. While the murder convictions carry mandatory life sentences with no parole, Colorado law requires that Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour formally impose the penalties. Samour must also decide the punishment for the other charges Holmes was convicted of. A jury found Holmes guilty of 165 counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder and explosive charges stemming from the July 20, 2012, mass shooting inside a Denver-area multiplex during a midnight screening of a Batman movie. The 27-year-old onetime neuroscience graduate student had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and prosecutors had sought the death penalty. The nine-woman, three-man jury could not unanimously agree to condemn Holmes to death during the trial's penalty phase. Under Colorado law, he must automatically serve 12 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. About 100 people are set to give victim impact statements at this week's hearing, the Arapahoe County District Attorney's Office said in a statement. The victims cannot address Holmes directly. After the testimony from victims, lead prosecutor George Brauchler will present his sentencing argument, the statement said. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Defense lawyers can present mitigation evidence on the attempted murder convictions, but it is unclear if they will do so. It is also unknown whether Holmes will make a statement before he is sentenced. He declined to speak in his own defense throughout the earlier proceedings. The California native could ultimately be sentenced to a maximum of 3,318 years in prison, in addition to the mandatory life sentences, prosecutors said.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”: “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides.

They’re part of a cycle in which innocent people are murdered and politicians get away with doing nothing Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.20 BST The first time I did something about America’s epidemic of mass shootings was not when I looked up and saw on TV that a child had shot up a school full of children – although that’s happened a lot of times here.  It wasn’t when I saw a horrific video playing on a loop on Facebook on Wednesday, like so much of the rest of the world did, after another video of the same killing played in a loop on the the cable networks and across Twitter, even as people called for the Virginia video to disappear. No, there wasn’t social media or an online death reel of snuff films in the midst of a sniper’s killing spree in the Washington DC metro area, way back in 2002. I didn’t write my then-congressman demanding more gun control, of which we have little. I didn’t email my then-senators demanding that they do something to reduce the number of guns on the streets, because I knew they didn’t really read their emails. I didn’t even call my state assemblywoman or my state senator in Richmond, Virginia, to demand that they close the state’s well-known and egregious loophole that lets people buy guns easily at gun shows. Instead, I positioned the back of my car toward a building, and stood, bent over, behind my car door while I pumped gas – in case a teenage sniper was aiming at me, from somewhere I couldn’t see, hunting me. The blasé acceptance that, yes, you might well get shot some day is as much of a facet of American life in 2015 as it was in 2002. We are as desensitized now as we were were in 1993, when Colin Ferguson shot up a Long Island Railroad train car of commuters and in 1984, when James Huberty shot up a McDonalds in San Ysidro, California. The shooting at the University of Albany, in upstate New York (1994) didn’t change anything. Columbine (1999) didn’t change anything. The Lancaster, Pennsylvania Amish schoolhouse shooting (2006) didn’t change anything. Nothing changed for Americans because our political leaders didn’t change anything. Instead, a nation ducked. The big names – Aurora, Sandy Hook, Fort Hood, Tucson, Virginia Tech, Lafayette, Isla Vista, the Navy Yard, Charleston – you remember. The lesser-known ones (Jonesboro, say, or Carson City, or the courthouse shooting in Reno, or the other shooting on Fort Hood, or Northern Illinois University): those we only dimly recollect, because we saw ourselves in the victims, because we could hardly even remember all of details of all of the mass shootings in our lifetime. We remember because of the press coverage, the calls for more stringent gun control, because this one went after women and the other walked into a cineplex screening of the next movie you thought you’d probably see. We remember because we’re kind of scared to go to the movies in America now, or pump gas – or even watch TV or go on Facebook because we might catch yet another glimpse of a grim spectacle looking back at us. In 2015, as in 2002, the threat is everywhere, and it’s nowhere. The threat of American gun violence is the guy who walks into the movie theatre after the lights go down. The truth of America’s firearm obsession is the kid who walks into the school long after the bell’s rung for class. The horror of the United States doing nothing about the Glocks you can get for a couple hundred bucks is the lookie-loo in your peripheral vision as you’re trying to do a stand-up shot next to a lake. Is it still shocking that there are legally-armed Americans killing innocent strangers? The Washington Post points out that there’s been more than one mass shooting per day in 2015 (that is, shooting incidents in which more than four people were injured). The Centers for Disease Control statistics show that more than 33,000 people will have fatal encounters with guns in a given year. When gun violence happens every day, it’s hard to be shocked; fatal shootings are, at this point, a given of American life, whether we like to admit it or not. Let’s admit it. At least that’s doing something. Politicians call for background checks because it’s the least they can possibly do to respond to yet another mass shooting and, besides which, there’s growing support for background checks even as general support for gun control declines. It doesn’t even matter that there’s no good way to use America’s incredibly flawed mental health care system to somehow populate a database of people too ill to own guns without turning them on other people. It doesn’t matter that the meagre background check system in place now flagged Charleston shooter Dylann Roof’s reported marijuana arrest, but an arrest isn’t enough to disqualify one from gun ownership. Background checks are apparently the only answer to mass shootings, because it’s the only answer politicians can offer and still get reelected. When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns, the gun lobby helpfully opines – but at least then we would be able to tell the difference. Now, you don’t know until someone starts shooting. (Especially if you frequent restaurants preferred by so-called “open carry” advocates.) There will be another mass shooting soon enough, of course. There will be another period of mourning in which any talk of doing something about just how many guns we have will be shushed by conservatives eager to not politicize the deaths of some new number of innocents. There will be another video to shock us and fulfil our collective voyeuristic instincts – maybe even, as happened on Wednesday in Virginia, a first-person documentation of another person’s brutality and inhumanity, filmed from the only end of a gun on which we’re supposed to want to stand. There will be another round of political promises, another round of legislative failure, another period of time in which we all duck behind our cars until the fear eases just enough to carry on with our regular lives. And then someone else with yet another gun will murder yet another group of people, and we’ll start the cycle all over again. And you’ll be watching. Now what are we going to do about it?",2015-08-26 21:49:11,The blasé acceptance that you might get shot is a fact of American life | Megan Carpentier,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

35,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/27/virginia-shooting-gun-control-obstacles-remain,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.20 BST Nationwide revulsion over the killing of two journalists on live television has prompted fresh calls for gun reform – but campaigners are as far as ever from cutting through the political gridlock that prevents it at many levels of US government.  The father of WDBJ reporter Alison Parker, who was shot dead by a former colleague in Virginia on Wednesday, echoed calls from relatives in other recent shootings by demanding lawmakers put aside worries over supposed constitutional protection for gun ownership and the lobbying power of the National Rifle Association. “Look, I’m for the second amendment [the right to bear arms], but there has to be a way to force politicians that are cowards and in the pockets of the NRA to come to grips and make sense, have sensible laws so that crazy people can’t get guns,” Andy Parker told CNN on Thursday. “It can’t be that hard. And yet, politicians from the local level to the state level to the national level, they sidestep the issue. They kick the can down the road. This can’t happen any more.” In the aftermath of Wednesday’s horrific shooting in the town of Moneta, near Roanoke, some gun reform activists expressed hope that the gruesome circumstances of the crime – which was broadcast live on TV and then posted to social media – might finally shock a numbed political class into action. Colin Goddard, a senior policy advocate for Everytown for Gun Safety, the anti-gun violence coalition backed by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the way the shooting unfolded on live television could distinguish it from other incidents that are only read about in the news. “We got a small glimpse into the horror of what a shooting is like with what happened,” Goddard told the Guardian. “When you get a three-second video of someone actually pointing a gun at somebody else, you hear those gunshots, and you hear the screams, you can actually feel how horrifying and terrifying those events are.” Goddard said while he did not wish to give notoriety to the killer, Vester Flanagan II, his video encapsulated the daily reality that gun control groups are trying to highlight across the country. “America does not have a monopoly on disgruntled employees or people suffering mental illness, but what is unique to America is that we give easy access to firearms,” he said. Goddard is himself a survivor of the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech, the deadliest gun massacre by a single perpetrator in US history. After a gunman killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in that campus shooting, an aggressive campaign for tougher gun laws swept the state of Virginia – but much like efforts at the federal level, they remain stymied. National reform efforts, first championed by Barack Obama and more recently by Democratic presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton, have focused on passing legislation to close loopholes in the system of background checks required to buy a gun. But officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms revealed on Thursday that Flanagan had passed a background check and bought the murder weapon used in Wednesday’s shooting, a Glock handgun, legally. “I have no indication that anything was done illegally or improperly, or any shortcuts were made,” an ATF spokesman, Tom Faison, told the Roanoke Times. “He could be as mentally ill as the day is long,” he added, “but unless someone has been legally adjudicated as such, they can purchase a firearm.” It remains unknown to what extent Flanagan struggled with mental illness, if at all; when he worked at WDBJ7, a supervisor told him he should seek help and he showed a pattern of anger-related problems that eventually contributed to his firing from the station. Even proposed legislation on enhancing background checks, which fell five senators short of the 60 needed to proceed in Congress two years ago, is struggling to gain momentum. One of its original sponsors, Republican Pat Toomey, recently played down reports that the bill could be reintroduced and did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Instead, the NRA has swung behind a much watered-down bill suggested by Texas Republican John Cornyn that would merely encourage states to send more information on mental illness to a national database. The proposed legislation is opposed by many gun reform groups as an empty distraction, but a version of it has recently been supported by New York Democrat Chuck Schumer. In Virginia, Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, has also struggled to push reforms through the state legislature despite making gun safety laws a cornerstone of his legislative agenda. The governor, who is both a gun owner and vocal gun control advocate, on Wednesday vowed to renew his push for stricter gun laws in the wake of the Roanoke shooting. McAuliffe sought a package of gun control measures in Virginia earlier this year, including a renewal of a monthly limit on handgun purchases, closing a loophole that allows individuals to purchase firearms at gun shows without undergoing a background check, and strengthening laws that would bar people convicted of domestic violence offences from accessing a gun. But the Republican-controlled state legislature in January blocked any new gun laws from clearing even a senate committee, choosing instead to advance bills that loosened certain restrictions on firearms.

36,http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122629/can-australias-approach-gun-violence-work-america,"The on-camera shooting on Wednesday of two Virginia reporters has already reignited the debate over gun control in America. “I’m going to do something to shame legislators into doing something about closing loopholes and background checks and making sure crazy people don’t get guns,” Andy Parker, the father of slain WDBJ reporter Alison Parker, told Fox News. Earlier efforts to push gun control legislation through Congress have failed. But Vox’s Zack Beauchamp describes a compelling case study for how another country has tackled the issue of gun violence. In the late 1990s, following a mass shooting, Australia launched a mandatory gun buy-back program. The government banned a number of types of guns, including automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, purchased guns from owners at fair market value, and offered amnesty for anyone turning in an illegally owned firearm. About 650,000 guns were seized and destroyed. Afterwards, Australia's murder and suicide rates dropped. Could such a program work in America? Certain cities have already experimented with such an approach. The Los Angeles Police Department, for example, regularly holds buybacks and then melt down the guns. Cities in Florida, Connecticut, California, Arkansas, and Massachusetts also held gun buy-back initiatives in June this year, according to The Trace, a website dedicated to covering gun violence. More often than not, however, when police confiscate illegal guns or firearms found at crime scenes, they turn around and sell those weapons on the open market, raising quick cash for police supplies or training. Many states, including Kentucky, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Montana, have laws on the books that encourage or require local police to put the guns they collect each day back on the streets. In theory, this would result in taking guns out of the hands of criminals and putting them into the hands of responsible, law-abiding gun owners. Thanks to the nation's patchwork of background check laws, however, it's very easy for guns to wind up in the hands of criminals (again). In many states, a straw purchaser with no criminal record could buy the weapon legally from a licensed dealer, then sell it, legally, in a private sale without requiring the buyer to undergo a background check. Let us not forget that Vester Lee Flanagan, the man who committed the horrific shooting in Virginia on Wednesday, obtained his gun legally. The police practice of holding auctions or trading in guns to a dealer is legal under federal law, and in some states it's mandatory. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative network of lawmakers and corporations, and National Rifle Association both have their fingerprints on these laws advancing in Montana, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Here’s a small sampling of the widespread practice: In 2009, Montana passed a law prohibiting guns from being destroyed by police, and instead requiring them to be sold off to licensed dealers. North Carolina and Tennessee followed suit in 2010. The Tennessee law states, ""Any weapon declared contraband shall be sold in a public sale or used for legitimate law enforcement purposes, at the discretion of the court.” Texas in 2013 passed a law that gives local departments the option to resell guns. The Memphis Police Department in Tennessee traded 500 of its confiscated guns in return for 33 new assault rifles. A local outlet reported that guns sold by police have been traced to new crimes. In 2010, a man shot two police officers in the Pentagon using a gun sold by the Memphis police department in 2008. The Duluth, Minnesota, the police department sold 46 of its shotguns for $5,538. One of those guns was used to shoot two officers at another police department. The mentally ill man who shot the officers would not have passed a background check, but he was able to obtain the gun easily through a straw purchase on an online auction—private sellers require no such background checks. Indiana’s Evansville police sold 145 firearms in 2015 to raise $24,915 for the department’s firearms training. Since 1998, Kentucky has had a law that lets the Kentucky State Police collect confiscated guns from local police departments and sell them in an auction. A single auction can include more than 400 guns, and auctions can collect $650,000 a year, 20 percent of which goes to state police and 80 percent of which goes back to local agencies. Guns used in murders can be sold off, as well. After the June mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, President Barack Obama called once again for stronger gun laws, and noted that he “had to make statements like this too many times.” Now, in the wake of this week's tragedy, we are having that conversation once again. As long as federal background checks are too weak and the enforcement of existing laws remains too timid, however, we’re essentially encouraging more gun violence. Taking weapons off the streets could help reduce gun violence in America. Yet sometimes, even our own law enforcement agencies are the ones responsible for putting weapons into the wrong hands.

40,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/aug/28/self-publishing-killers-20150828/,"However depressingly common gun violence has become in the United States, high-profile cases continue to shock us. And this week, the news that a Virginia television crew had been murdered during a live broadcast only became more horrifying after the suspect, Vester Lee Flanagan II, posted what appeared to be his own video of the killings before committing suicide. But however sickening Flanagan's broadcast was, he was hardly the first person to take advantage of technological advancements to self-publish material related to a murder. And self-publishing is a natural if unpleasant evolution in the long relationship between killers and the media. Flanagan's postings were probably inevitable, as may be a new kind of horror: a killing that's not just broadcast, but live-streamed. The relationship between murderers and media outlets flows both ways; reporters have long recognized the news value in reaching out to a killer, sometimes even when a crime is in progress. When Howard Unruh embarked on the 1949 massacre of his neighbors that would become known as the Walk of Death, Camden Evening Courier writer Philip W. Buxton reached Unruh on the phone after he barricaded himself in his mother's apartment--the number was in the phone book. Buxton got out two questions before police started moving in on the apartment. And killers sometimes reach out to the media either before or during their acts. During his 2006 mass shooting at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle, Naveed Afzal Haq both talked about wanting to speak with reporters from CNN and asked an emergency dispatcher to patch him through to the network, a request she said she couldn't grant. Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in 2007, mailed a statement, photos and a series of videos to NBC News; the package arrived after Cho began his attack. Two years later, Jiverly Antares Wong mailed a similar package to a Syracuse, New York, television station the day he carried out a shooting at the Binghamton American Civic Association; he had taken English classes at the association, and shot the organization's receptionists before opening fire in an English-as-a-second-language class. Killers who reach out to reporters or send material to media outlets are relying on other people and organizations to broadcast their words. Television stations and newspapers may decide not to publish the material murderers send them because they do not want to compromise law enforcement investigations, because they do not want to give killers platforms, or out of respect for survivors and the families of the dead. So it's no surprise that as social media has made all sorts of self-publishing easier than ever that killers have begun to distribute their own manifestos and videos of their actions themselves. In One of Us, Asne Seierstad's book about Anders Behring Breivik's 2011 bombing of government buildings in Oslo and shootings of 69 people at the summer youth camp for the Norwegian Labor Party, she notes that a critical part of Breivik's plan was the distribution of a racist, largely plagiarized manifesto that railed against Muslim immigrants. ""Once the manifesto had been sent to a thousand email addresses, everything ground to a halt,"" Seierstad reports. ""[Norwegian telecommunications company] Telenor's spam filter had detected that the upper limit for the number of messages that could be sent per day had been reached."" Social media has no spam filter and no editors to express qualms about publication. Flanagan worked in media. The reporter and cameraman he killed were his colleagues. His crime exploited the live nature of the broadcast to make sure people would see his crime. Posting the video himself extended the reach of his terror beyond the local market for the broadcast and beyond anyone who was watching in the original time slot. Flanagan may have known more than other members of his deadly fraternity about how to make himself seen, but he's hardly alone in the desire to have his awful acts witnessed and acknowledged. Flanagan won't be the last, either. As sickening as the broadcasts were--my startled deskmates and I jumped when one of our colleagues played Flanagan's video in the newsroom--I'm afraid that worse is yet to come. Can it be long before a killer live-streams his terrible work? Technology, and an accelerating rate of mass killings, seems to make such an outcome inevitable. ------------v------------ Alyssa Rosenberg writes the Post's Act Four blog.

Written with Lady Antebellum’s Charles Kelley, Rucker tells Rolling Stone Country the song was hatched on the links. “We were playing golf one day and he said, ‘Dude, we’ve never written a song together.’ So we set a date and went and did it. The great thing for me about writing with him is he’s got that voice that’s like mine. But he’d sing a part I would never sing.” Related

						Chasteness, Soda Pop, and Show Tunes: The Lost Story of the Young Americans and the Choircore Movement Kelley reveals however that Rucker almost bailed on the session. “He said, ‘I don’t know if I can write tonight; I’m fried.’ I said, ‘You’re not backing out!'” Kelley says, laughing. “It worked out, and after we wrote it, he said, ‘This is my first single, I just know it.’ We caught a little magic with that idea. I told him, ‘You’re known for a lot of serious stuff, like [Lady Antebellum], but you also need some fun, light-hearted [songs] to play.”  Rucker admits “Homegrown Honey” isn’t heavy fare. “It wasn’t meant to change the world. It was meant for people to enjoy it,” he says. He’s also eager to write with Kelley again, perhaps after Lady A wraps up its tour next month. “I’d work with Charles Kelley anytime. I’d go do a Pancho and Lefty record with Charles,” Rucker says. “He is class, man.” With “Homegrown Honey” behind him, Rucker is turning his attention to a more personal song, current single and album title track “Southern Style.” It’s a love letter to his upbringing, even though the lyrics focus on a woman, one who likes “Lil Wayne and Lynyrd Skynyrd” and always makes time for famous preacher Billy Graham. “It is me. I know her,” Rucker says of the character in the song. “I remember a reporter asked if I thought the Billy Graham reference was a little political. I said, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. When I was a kid, we stopped everything we were doing and watched the Billy Graham Crusades.’ Billy Graham isn’t about politics — Billy Graham is about God. For me, [the character is] my mom, my sister.” “Southern Style” is also very much an ode to Charleston. Rucker is still processing the June mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. For him, the tragedy was an attack on family. “My son goes to school directly across the street from Mother Emanuel. I mean directly across the street. I park in the parking lot to pick him up sometimes,” he says, pausing. “That was . . . home. That was right in the heart of where we live, of our community.” Since then, he describes the vibe in the city as one of unfailing love. Says Rucker: “It’s just love, coming every day and every minute.” The singer is currently on the road with Brett Eldredge, Brothers Osborne and A Thousand Horses, running his Southern Style Tour into November. The tour makes a stop in Raleigh tonight. In This Article:

42,http://www.inquisitr.com/2374730/unbelievably-there-is-no-reason-to-expect-tighter-gun-control-in-the-wake-of-the-virginia-shootings/,"In the wake of the shocking on-air murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward this week, there have been predictable and sensible calls for tighter gun control. This would appear to be the cycle. A high-profile crime is committed, commentators comment, and then various people start calling for gun control. There are at least two disturbing features of this, not least of which is the fact that there is a routine, predictable cycle surrounding the senseless shooting of innocent people. A media and campaign machine have coalesced around these very human tragedies, to the point where news consumers not only expect mass shootings on a semi-regular basis, but are able to predict the kinds of products that will be generated by them. One of these products is the gun control debate. Every time there is a high-profile mass shooting, somebody, not unreasonably, calls for tighter gun control laws. In the most recent case, it's been Alison Parker's bereaved father, Andy Parker, calling on the president to step in and change the law. In an emotional message reported by the BBC, Mr. Parker pleaded with President Obama to tighten gun controls, saying,""Mr President, you need to do this. Please do it. Please do it for us and for other people so they're not going to lose their Alisons and their Adams.""Unfortunately, presidential intervention has completely failed up to this point. President Obama himself has been often quoted as saying that the failure to implement ""commonsense gun laws"" has been one of the biggest frustrations of his presidency. But why is this so? Why is it so difficult to enact a tranche of laws that so much of the public seem to want so badly? Surely, when even the governor of Virginia is moved to call for better gun control, we must have reached a tipping point? In the opinion of the experts, no. Analysts are practically unanimous in thinking that this latest tragedy is unlikely to have any effect on gun control laws whatsoever, and it's hard not to see their logic. Random shootings in churches, movie theaters, and, in the horrific case of Sandy Hook, elementary schools, have produced a grand total of zero positive movement in the direction of gun control. So, analytically speaking, why should this case be any different? The reasons for the continued prevalence of guns in America, as well as the stagnation of gun control efforts, are so manifold and so eminently sensible, it's difficult to see how any kind of argument is going to prevail against them. In Business Insider, Mira Oberman checks off the list of friction factors holding up gun control, and it's formidable. From the structure of the government, to the symbolic value of guns in American culture, these factors appear to be hard-wired into America's view of itself. It would appear that, as emotionally charged as the pleas for gun control may be, they are outmatched by the emotions on the pro-gun side. And when we have two viewpoints, resting mainly on emotion, competing with each other, we simply have no choice other than to turn to facts. The facts are unambiguous, despite what the pro-gun lobby likes to assert. The evidence is in and the conclusions are obvious. Tighter gun control leads to lower gun crime. A standard response is to blame other factors, such as Donald Trump's recent claim that the Virginia shooting was not a function of gun control, but of mental illness, but this just doesn't stand up. Australia has almost exactly the same rate of mental illness as America, and world-famously strict gun control laws. The net result? Per capita, Australia has 80 percent less gun crime than America. When will the American government be able to enact tougher gun control? If we are to believe the experts and analysts, possibly never. But this can't be so. Surely, if the narrative can move from emotion to fact and evidence-based reasoning, surely reason can prevail and tighter gun controls can be implemented. Surely America can see that tighter gun control is the only way to change a situation where mass shootings are occurring at the rate of one a day? It's obvious, yes? As much as I hate to say it, as a news watcher, I'm compelled to say no. Prove me wrong, America.

43,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/89FRyq5VcJ4/hillary-clinton-really-is-coming-for-your-guns.html,"SEARCH Some politicians talk about gun control once in a while. Clinton has been pushing to curb firearms for decades. No wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down. Washington Bureau Chief Editor's Note: Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to tackle gun violence on Oct. 5, including the repeal of liability protection for gun manufactuerers; closing the gunshow loophole, which allows people to buy firearms without background checks from private sellers; preventing gun purchases from being finalized before a background check is completed. “Something is deeply wrong,” Hillary Clinton told the audience at the Democratic National Committee on Friday. Earlier in the week, a gunman killed two journalists in Roanoke, Virginia, on live television, just days before an unstable person with a gun murdered a highway state trooper in Louisiana. It all points to a national sickness, an impotence when it comes to curbing the spread of firearms to dangerous individuals, Clinton said. “I believe we can have common sense gun reform that keeps weapons out of the hands that should not have them—domestic abusers, the violently unstable—while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.” Hillary Clinton has long pushed to regulate access to guns. In her Friday speech, she pledged her presidency would be no different. “Now I know the politics are hard. I know that some would rather throw up their hands and give up the fight, but not me. I’m not going to sit by while more good people die across America,” she said. Of course, it’s easy for candidates for president—especially Democratic candidates for president—to say they’re going to do something on guns. Actually accomplishing anything is much harder—like Labor-of-Hercules difficult. After the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting that killed 20 elementary school students and six of their teachers, President Obama made a massive push for relatively modest gun regulation. He got nothing. But for Clinton, gun control has been a significant part of her political identity. She’s been working to regulate the firearms industry for decades, and had a front row seat the last time a president actually managed to pass any gun-control measure. In other words: other candidates may say they’re coming for unregulated guns. Clinton really is. No wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down. Her experiences in the ’90s—and the massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in particular—seemed to shape her views and belief that the laws needed to change to better protect people. The Clinton administration came into the White House in 1993 with a pledge to sign the Brady Bill, which implemented a five-day waiting period and a background check in order to buy a handgun. Once Bill Clinton was in the office, he worked with former White House press secretary James Brady and his wife, Sarah, to pass the bill. And it was over the course of that fight Hillary Clinton forged a strong friendship with Sarah. In her book, Living History, Clinton marveled at the Bradys’ strength. “The bill wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of James and Sarah Brady,” she wrote. “He and his indomitable wife, Sarah, had dedicated their lives to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.” “Hillary was always really supportive, there was never a time it was in question,” said a longtime friend of Sarah Brady, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly about their relationship. “They became incredibly close—close on the issue and close personally.” Sarah and James, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary before he was shot during an assassination attempt in 1981, both appeared at the 1992 Democratic convention in support of the Clintons. When Sarah Brady published her book in 2002, Hillary spoke at her book party in Washington, D.C. If the Bradys’ tenacity on the issue inspired Clinton, the mass shooting at Columbine High School emboldened her to push for changes to gun laws—particularly the so-called gun show loopholes. On April 20, 1999, two teenagers murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher in Littleton, Colorado. It was the deadliest school shooting in American history up to that point. And it sent the country into a debate over easy access to firearms. A month after Columbine shootings, Bill and Hillary Clinton traveled to the shattered Denver suburb to meet with the families who lost their children in the violence. Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman at the time, said one by one the Clintons were introduced to family members who had lost their kin. “It is hard to describe how unspeakably tragic it is to meet family after family all sitting in room with their loved ones, all of whom have lost a child, a brother or sister, to senseless gun violence,” Lockhart, who accompanied the Clintons to Littleton after the Columbine massacre, said. “It’s impossible to fully measure how it will impact any given person, but I’m certain that it forever impacts any leader who has to go through it.” Clinton described the meetings as “gut-wrenching” in her memoir. She reflected on seeing “the faces of parents who were living through their worst nightmare, dealing with the loss of their own children in such a senseless, disturbing act of violence.” “Parents and teenagers alike asked Bill and me to make sure these horrible losses were not in vain,” she wrote. So when President Clinton launched a nationwide ad campaign to draw awareness to youth violence and formed a task force to examine why the nation’s youth had become increasingly prone to violence, Hillary became deeply involved. Jeff Bleich, who served as the director of the White House Commission on Youth Violence, said Hillary Clinton was very active in his group. “My main impression overall,” he said, “was that she stayed with the issue.  Some people in government lost focus on youth violence as soon as the next crisis occurred, but she and her office continued to check in to see how the program was going.” And while the politics of gun control changed dramatically once her husband left the White House, Clinton kept at the issue once she got to the Senate, where she was a reliable vote for gun-safety measures. She supported renewing the assault weapons ban and barring the sale of high-capacity magazines. “She’s worked on these issues for a really long time—she really comes to this as an advocate for kids and families,” said Neera Tanden, president of Center for American Progress and a longtime Hillary Clinton aide. When Clinton announced her candidacy for the Senate in February 2000, she pledged “to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children, for closing the gun-show loophole, requiring child safety locks and licensing all new handgun owners.” She also co-sponsored several bills aimed at closing the so-called “gun show loophole” and voted to renew the assault weapons ban in 2004. These efforts, however, all came up short, and the Bill Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired. The gun-control measures were good politics in New York. But by 2008, when Hillary was running for national office, she softened her position a bit. When asked by NBC’s Tim Russert whether she would implement a plan wherein “everyone who wishes to purchase a gun should have a license, and that every handgun sale or transfer should be registered in a national registry,” during a presidential debate in 2008, Clinton said it was not politically possible. “Well, I am against illegal guns, and illegal guns are the cause of so much death and injury in our country,” she said. “I also am a political realist and I understand that the political winds are very powerful against doing enough to try to get guns off the street, get them out of the hands of young people.” In other words, the pivot on gun control was temporary, tiny. She added, “We need to have a registry that really works, with good information about people who are felons, people who have been committed to mental institutions like the man in Virginia Tech who caused so much death and havoc. We need to make sure that that information is in a timely manner, both collected and presented.” The years since the 2008 campaign have been an exercise in frustration for the gun-control movement. And in today’s presidential race, Clinton’s nearest Democratic competitor—Bernie Sanders—voted against the Brady Bill and has a record on gun control that looks much more right-leaning than far left. Sanders represents Vermont, where gun laws are pretty much nonexistent, but those views and votes might not sit well with some of the more hard-core Democratic voters. As one Democratic voter told The Daily Beast, Sanders is “using phrases that the gun extremists and the NRA use, saying things like it’s about people not liking guns… A lot of us are super Bernie Sanders supporters and we were all really disappointed that he could talk about it this way.” NRA chief Wayne LaPierre, on the other hand, had nothing but bile for Sanders’s opponent. “I vow on this day the NRA will stand shoulder to shoulder with you and good, honest decent Americans,” he said during April’s NRA convention, “and we will stand and fight with everything we’ve got and in 2016, by God, we will elect the next great president of the United States of America and it will not be Hillary Rodham Clinton.” For the Democratic front-runner, it was a rather sweet endorsement.",2015-08-29 00:13:00,Hillary Really Is Coming After Your Guns,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

News By Associated Press Submit August 30, 2015 | 3:33pm AUSTIN, Texas — A statue of Jefferson Davis was removed from its pedestal Sunday on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, days after a court rejected an appeal from a Confederate heritage group. Crews were seen removing the statue of the Confederate president from its place near the university’s iconic clock tower. APDavis’ statue will eventually be displayed in the Briscoe Center history museum on campus, which university officials said is a more appropriate place for it. The Briscoe Center has one of the nation’s largest archives on slavery. The statue has been a target of vandalism as well as criticism that it is a symbol of racism and discrimination. Confederate symbols nationwide are being reconsidered following the recent mass shooting of members of a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. “This is an iconic moment,” said Gregory Vincent, the university’s vice president for diversity and community engagement, according to the Austin American-Statesman. “It really shows the power of student leadership.” A judge last week ruled against the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which sued to stop the university from moving it. Statues of other Confederate figures — Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston, and Confederate Postmaster General John H. Reagan — will remain in their places on campus. University officials halted earlier plans to move the Davis statue after the Sons of Confederate Veterans asked a judge to stop them. The Confederate group compared the proposal to relocate the statue to the Islamic State group destroying artifacts in the Middle East. But State District Judge Karin Crump ruled last week that Texas officials have the authority under state law to decide where the statue should stand.

53,http://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Lessons-from-the-murders-of-Virginia-journalists-6472297.php,"The slaying of two journalists Wednesday as they broadcast live to a television audience in Virginia is still seared on our screens and our minds, but it's a moment not only to mourn but also to learn lessons. The horror isn't just one macabre double-murder, but the unrelenting toll of gun violence that claims one life every 16 minutes on average in the United States. Three quick data points: More Americans die in gun homicides and suicides every six months than have died in the last 25 years in every terrorist attack and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq combined. More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in U.S. history. American children are 14 times as likely to die from guns as children in other developed countries, according to David Hemenway, a Harvard professor and author of an excellent book on firearm safety. Bryce Williams, as the Virginia killer was known to viewers when he worked as a broadcaster, apparently obtained the gun used to murder his former co-workers Alison Parker and Adam Ward in response to the June massacre in a South Carolina church - an example of how gun violence begets gun violence. Williams may have been mentally disturbed, given that he videotaped Wednesday's killings and then posted them on Facebook. ""I've been a human powder keg for a while  just waiting to go BOOM!!!!,"" Williams reportedly wrote in a lengthy fax sent to ABC News after the killings. Whether or not Williams was insane, our policies on guns are demented - not least in that we don't even have universal background checks to keep weapons out of the hands of people waiting to go boom. The lesson from the ongoing carnage is not that we need a modern prohibition, but that we should address gun deaths as a public health crisis. To protect the public, we regulate toys and mutual funds, ladders and swimming pools. Shouldn't we regulate guns as seriously as we regulate toys? The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has seven pages of regulations concerning ladders, which are involved in 300 deaths in America annually. Yet the federal government doesn't make what I would call a serious effort to regulate guns, which are involved in the deaths of more than 33,000 people in America annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (that includes suicides, murders and accidents). Gun proponents often say things to me like: What about cars? They kill, too, but we don't try to ban them! Cars are actually the best example of the public health approach that we should apply to guns. Over the decades, we have systematically taken steps to make cars safer: We adopted seatbelts and air bags, limited licenses for teenage drivers, cracked down on drunken driving and established roundabouts and better crosswalks, auto safety inspections and rules about texting while driving. This approach has been successful. By my calculations, if we had the same auto fatality rate as in 1921, we would have 715,000 Americans dying annually from cars. We have reduced the fatality rate by more than 95 percent. Yet in the case of firearms, the gun lobby has for years tried to block even research on how to reduce gun deaths. The gun industry made a childproof gun back in the 19th century but today has ferociously resisted ""smart guns."" If someone steals an iPhone, it requires a PIN; guns don't.  We're not going to eliminate gun deaths in America. But a serious effort might reduce gun deaths by, say, one-third, and that would be 11,000 lives saved a year. The United States is an outlier, both in our lack of serious policies toward guns and in our mortality rates. Hemenway calculates that the U.S. firearm homicide rate is seven times that of the next country in the rich world on the list, Canada, and 600 times higher than that of South Korea. We need universal background checks with more rigorous screening, limits on gun purchases to one a month to reduce trafficking, safe storage requirements, serial number markings that are more difficult to obliterate, waiting periods to buy a handgun - and more research on what steps would actually save lives. If the federal government won't act, states should lead. Australia is a model. In 1996, after a mass shooting there, the country united behind tougher firearm restrictions. The Journal of Public Health Policy notes that the firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved. Here in America, we can similarly move from passive horror to take steps to reduce the 92 lives claimed by gun violence in the United States daily. Surely we can regulate guns as seriously as we do cars, ladders and swimming pools.

Chris Murphy on to discuss gun violence after the horrific murders of WDBJ7’s Alison Parker and Alex Ward, who were murdered on air by ex-employee Vester Lee Flanagan. Murphy is your typical liberal Democrat from New England–and a staunch supporter of gun control. During the interview, he said that Congress is complicit in these murders if nothing is done by the fall. At the same time, he admitted that gun control policy emanating from Washington is probably not going to stop future shootings. Poppy Harlow: You said, Senator, in an interview with The Huffington Post this morning, “Congress’ silence in the face of this rash of mass shootings has become complicity. We are essentially sending a message of quiet endorsements to these murders.” Who are you talking about in Congress? Senator Murphy: I’m talking about the entirety of Congress, especially those that have stood in the way of common sense gun measures like expanded background checks or reforms to our mental health system. The fact is, is that when our leadership in Congress stands up and says we can’t do anything, they are absolutely wrong. And I believe that we have become complicit in these murders because people listen to highest levels of government and when we say nothing about it – when we don’t even attempt to change the laws to try to stop this mass slaughter – then people get some signal that it’s okay so settle their grievances or to deal with their illness through gun violence. I just don’t accept that we can do nothing and I’m speaking directly to the Republican leadership of the House and the Senate. They should be bringing anti-gun violence bills to the floor that can get consensus votes this fall or the Congress is complicit in these murders. Harlow also discussed 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jim Gilmore’s remarks regarding this tragedy. The former Virginia governor said that gun control isn’t the answer, and that the real problem is fixing our mental health system. Poppy Harlow: I went on to say what is the answer and he said community-based mental health services and more of that. What is the answer in your mind, Senator? Senator Murphy: Well, let’s be honest about what the data shows. We don’t have any more mental illness in the United States than any other country in the world has, and yet we have five times the rate of gun violence, so it can’t be that mental illness is the only answer. The reality is, is that the data shows us that in countries and communities that have more guns – especially have more guns in the hands of criminals, especially have more dangerous assault weapons out on the streets – there’s more gun violence. More guns equals more gun violence. Now, I don’t want to stop law-abiding citizens from being able to own guns, but the fact is that the left wing of this country, as Mr. Gilmore says, I guess is 90% of the country because that’s the number of Americans that support something like expanded background checks. So you just can’t throw this whole problem on the backs of the mental health system, and you also have to recognize that you’re feeding the stigma. The fact is that there’s no inherent connection between mental illness and violence, and that kind of talk should stop. Poppy Harlow: What about this shooting and the fact that this gunman, as far as we know right now, did not have any sort of documented history of mental illness. Obviously something was completely wrong with him. He idolized other mass shooters but what do you do about this situation, Senator? Senator Murphy: Well, I don’t think you can craft a legislative solution to every single incident of violence in this country, and so I don’t think that we should expect that anything that we’re going to enact in Washington is going to stop shootings, but there are plenty of instances – including the Connecticut shooting and the South Carolina shooting – in which better gun laws could have made a difference. In South Carolina, that guy got a gun because of the loophole in the background checks law that allowed the retailer to give him a gun despite the fact he hadn’t passed the background check. And this whole culture of mass violence in which Congress does nothing, I think, sends a message to a lot of these individuals who are becoming unhinged in their mind that it’s okay to go out and commit these murders because no one seems to be doing anything to stop it, and so why should [they] think any differently than everybody else that [they] see on the news carrying out this kind of violence? There’s no one legislative solution, but there are changes that will make a difference, and Congress acting – just the action of Congress in any way, shape, or form – will have a chilling effect on this trend. First, of course, violence increases when firearms are in the hands of criminals; that’s saying you are probably going to get hit by a car if you blow through a red light. It’s common sense. Second, more guns does not equal more gun violence (via Reason): Vermont has some of the loosest gun laws in America. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gives it an “F.” The state requires no background checks for private gun sales, permits the sale and possession of “assault weapons,” and allows concealed guns to be carried in public—without a license. After the fatal on-air shooting of a TV reporter and her cameraman in Roanoke, Va., on Wednesday, blame was heaped on America’s permissive firearms policy. “There are too many guns, and too little national will to do anything about them,” asserted an editorial in The New York Times. Democratic politicians and commentators said the murders proved the need for more restrictions on guns. But did they? Vermont isn’t much different from a lot of states in the regulation of these weapons. But it’s very different in the volume of bloodshed. In 2013, it had the third-lowest homicide rate in the country—less than one-sixth that of Louisiana. Utah, which also got an “F” on its laws from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, had the fourth-lowest homicide rate. These places refute the belief that loose gun rules and high ownership are bound to produce frenzies of carnage. Also, regarding the talking point about limiting access to guns to reduce suicides, one just has to look at Japan and South Korea. National Review noted that the latter has the highest suicide rate in the developed world, despite all guns virtually being illegal. Hunting rifles must be stored at police stations. In Japan, the rate of gun ownership is incredibly low, and most firearms are illegal to possess. Still, the suicide rate is astronomical. Lastly, mental illness is a serious factor in this discussion. The vast majority of perpetrators who have engaged in mass shootings exhibited symptoms of mental illness. The left-wing publication, Mother Jones, crunched the numbers. Their conclusion: maybe we need a better mental health system [emphasis mine]: After another young man unleashed horror inside a Colorado movie theater this July, we set out to track mass shootings in the United States over the last 30 years. We identified and analyzed 62 of them—25 in the last seven years alone. Nearly 80 percent of the perpetrators in these 62 cases obtained their weapons legally. Acute paranoia, delusions, and depression were rampant among them, with at least 36 of the killers committing suicide on or near the scene. Seven others died in police shootouts they had little hope of surviving (a.k.a. “suicide by cop”). And according to additional research we completed recently, at least 38 of them displayed signs of possible mental health problems prior to the killings. Again, the issue is keeping firearms out if the hands of the mentally ill. Both sides can come together on this, but it’s the left that wants to relegate this rather important piece of the conversation to the periphery–and focus on policies that either would do little to curb gun violence or lead to mass confiscation. As for the so-called background check loophole Sen. Murphy discusses, it’s not a loophole when government fails to update the National Instance Background Check System (NICS) with a felony charge that would have prevented Dylann Roof from purchasing a firearm. That’s negligence on government’s part. Moreover, a three-day delayed release is part of a pro-gun control law–the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Also, a gun dealer isn’t required by law to follow through with a purchase if their customer is subjected to the three-day delayed release. At any rate, a delayed release is a rare instance, so we’re not really speaking to anything substantial that will reduce overall gun violence. Lastly, Connecticut’s gun control laws did work; Adam Lanza refused to be subjected to a 14-day background check for a rifle days before he committed the horrific mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012. Instead, he killed his mother, and took her firearms to commit his heinous act. Lanza did what most criminals do to obtain firearms; he essentially stole them while committing a homicide in the process. The debate to keep firearms from the mentally unstable is going to be a tedious one. It’s a Gordian knot. It’s one that involves constitutional issues, doctor-patient confidentiality, the rights of the patient, or the privacy of the family that’s witnessed possible symptoms of mental illness with a loved one. There’s a way to navigate through this legal jungle gym, but we’re going to get nowhere if one side is only focused on making it harder for law-abiding citizens to own firearms, or worse, taking them away. Friendly Reminder: Sen. Murphy said there has been a school shooting once a week since Sandy Hook. The Washington Post awarded that claim with four Pinocchios. Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

Officials didn’t take it down until after a mass shooting – a young white man opened fire at a black church in Charleston steeped in Civil Rights history – made it clear that flying the Confederate flag, proudly, was a form of complicit encouragement for this hate crime. It was just two years ago that Paula Deen, the self-proclaimed queen of fat, salt, cream and all the other boastfully gluttonous elements of Southern cooking, was sued for racial and sexual discrimination. In Dean’s own deposition, she freely admitted to repeatedly using the N-word at and around members of the staff of her restaurant, many of whom were African American.  She also described there why it was OK to use the slur in telling jokes – and why slurs are fine in any joke about any targeted group – and her desire to have a “really Southern plantation-style wedding,” complete with a waitstaff comprised exclusively of middle-aged African-American men. (“I did not mean anything derogatory by saying that I loved their look and their professionalism,” she noted when questioned about these remarks.). And so perhaps in another 52 years the network executives at ABC will also admit to a gross miscalculation of judgment by inviting a blatantly, unavoidably racist woman onto their ratings-topping program Dancing With The Stars. Yes, Paula Deen herself – just two short years after a stilted, awkward video apology, quick weight loss and new career shilling diabetes drugs, and less than two months since she appeared in an image with her son, dressed as Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, with the latter in brown-face – has been cast on the latest season of the ballroom dance extravaganza welcomed into countless American homes for hours and hours (and hours) each week. Casting Paula Deen on Dancing With The Stars excuses away Deen’s behavior and actions as the kind of entertainment the show itself purports to be: sequins, music, dancing and ethnic slurs, hurrah! It’s all one and the same, equally weightless froth, when someone who espouses one is allowed to proudly sashay around on TV enjoying the benefits of the other. When we let someone like Paula Deen – when we let Paula Deen herself – become a casual, laughing part of the parade of popular culture, we not only excuse Deen’s casual racism, but condone it – the words she has used, the people she has objectified, the horror of slavery she has flippantly attempted to glamorize and commodify for her own consumption and profit. So now, an unsolicited note of advice to television producers everywhere: let’s not use mass-consumed popular culture to celebrate racism, or any other form of discrimination. I am not African-American, African or black. I am not a person of color. So I say this from the markedly privileged place of being a white woman in America: let’s not, ever, use popular culture to lift up and make entertainment out of racist people and racist behavior. Deen being cast on Dancing With The Stars is a bold statement from those who drive American television that black lives do not, in fact, matter. And, even worse, that intolerance, as long as it comes with a sunny accent and a white face, always will.",2015-09-03 10:45:11,To cast Paula Deen on Dancing With the Stars is to condone her racism | Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us

63,http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/sep/04/reading-american-cities-books-about-austin,"A bastion for liberals in Texas, Austin’s literary roots run deep. From stories about gentrification to books that explore its bohemian side, the dotcom era and crime, Michael Barrett examines the city’s literature in all its glory Last modified on Wed 21 Aug 2019 13.06 BST For the past 24 years, Austin has called itself the Live Music Capital of the World, a title supported by festivals like SXSW and Austin City Limits (ACL), musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughn, Willie Nelson, Janis Joplin, and Spoon, and nightly shows on Sixth, Red River, and Rainey streets. Outside of music, Austin means The University of Texas (UT), tech and start-ups, hipsters, filmmaking and movies like Boyhood, Slacker, and Office Space, bats flying from the Congress Avenue Bridge, Formula One racing, Whole Foods, barbecue, Barton Springs, and where Jim and Pam decide to move at the conclusion of The Office. But what of literary life? Don’t bearded bartenders read? Apparently they do, and Austin’s literary footprint has expanded as the city itself has grown. First settled in the 1830s – when it was named Waterloo – Austin is currently experiencing another boom, marking a sharp rise in traffic, gentrification, downtown construction, and literature.  Running themes in the city’s literary life include over-the-top politics filled with sex scandals and betrayal, falls from economic grace, romantic bohemians, and thrilling crime sagas. So much for the realism of heat, coffee snobbery, and untimed traffic lights. One of the works cited most often as representing Austin and its political heritage is Billy Lee Brammer’s The Gay Place – a title drawn from F Scott Fitzgerald’s poem Thousand-and-First Ship. First published in 1961, this interlocking trio of short novels brings the brash politics of 1950s Texas to life. Most agree that the main character, Arthur Fenstemaker, is based on Lyndon B Johnson, whose presidential library sits on the campus of UT, and the plot indisputably covers staples of Texas politics: marital alienation, sex, drinking (at a fictionalized Scholz Garden, which still is an Austin favorite for the political crowd), gossip, and legislative manoeuvring. According to Jan Reid, “More than any other book or film, The Gay Place captures the spirit and verve of Austin.” Karen Olsson’s novel Waterloo opens with a quote from The Gay Place, but brings Austin and its politics up to date. In her version of Austin, citizens strive “not to have to work too hard, to be locally renowned, and to drink beer paid for by somebody else”. This era of Austin centers around alternative publications (think the Texas Observer or Austin Chronicle), urban renewal, suburban politics, and conservative values masking the vices of musicians and politicians: more drinking, power struggles, and scandals. With frequent flashbacks to the 1950s and 60s readers can see how far Austin has come and what remains hidden under its surface. In Monday, Monday, Austin resident and author Elizabeth Crook provides more perspective about Austin in the 1960s, and decades later. Crook’s novel is set in motion by a real-life tragedy that permanently scarred Austin and that continues to be discussed to this day: the 1966 mass shooting from the clock tower of UT. If we next skip to the tech boom, which still defines aspects of the city, we come to Austin novelist Sarah Bird’s How Perfect Is That where we witness the aftermath of the dotcom bubble. Set around 2003, Bird describes the economic downfall of main character Blythe Young. While the “Dellionaire” crowd feeds Young’s catering company for a while, it eventually falls back to earth, along with everyone else, during the era of George W Bush. Austin author Mary Helen Specht gives another view of our tech recession in her debut novel Migratory Animals. Set after the 2008 economic crash in both Austin and Nigeria (where Specht spent time as a Fulbright Scholar), main character Flannery is pulled between her scientific work in Nigeria and family obligations in the Texan city. Of her descriptions of Austin, The New York Times noted, “Specht perfectly captures the minute details of contemporary life in a certain social niche of culture-rich, cash-poor pseudo-bohemians – the ‘Portlandia’ class – as well as their narcissism, immaturity and sense of entitlement. These are people who consider themselves the center of the universe, eternal college freshmen in love with their own self-declared brilliance and singularity.” Austin’s bohemian side features in Bird’s first novel, Alamo House. Published in 1986, it recreates life at UT’s west campus, home of fraternities and housing cooperatives. The novel depicts the independent, often vegetarian, and often hippie women of a fictional co-op that is based on the actual Seneca House that remains on the outskirts of campus today. David Heymann explores gentrification with a collection of seven stories, My Beautiful City Austin, revolving around an architect who, to his dismay, designs the type of houses often blamed for ruining the city’s charm. Of course we now have this problem under control – all Austin happy meals now include a McMansion law. Crime stories based in Austin could probably fill a section of a bookstore, with just a few notable examples being The Devil Went Down to Austin, the Dan Reles Mysteries (four novels), and The Seventh Victim. The novel A Twist at the End: A Novel of O. Henry and the Texas Servant Girl Murders of 1885 perhaps stands apart for its fictional portrayal of America’s supposed first recorded serial murders. It wouldn’t feel right to talk about our portrayal in novels without highlighting Austin’s overall role in literature. Our literary story starts with academic programs nurturing innovative writers, and Austin is home to one of the most prestigious writing programs in the country: the Michener Center for Writers. Only accepting 12 students per year, and granting each a generous fellowship, this school has generated more than its fair share of famous writers. Kevin Powers, Domenica Ruta, Philipp Meyer, Kelly Luce, Sarah Cornwell, Carrie Fountain, and Mary Miller are a few Michener luminaries, and at any given time, its students are poised to join the ranks of their famous counterparts. A few blocks away on campus is the New Writers Project, and a short drive from the city is the renown MFA program of Texas State University. The next link in Austin’s literary chain is reserved for its publishers. Like many other cities with a large student population, Austin produces its fair share of indie books, literary journals, comics, and zines every year. To name a few, Austin hosts A Strange Object, American Short Fiction, Austin Zine Fest, Bat City Review, Host Publications, fields, The Austin Review, and Write Bloody Publishing. At the intersection of the comic/zine and literary magazine realms is a new arts and literature festival, the New South Festival of Literary Arts & Cartooning, which started in 2015 at the French Legation Museum on the city’s booming east side with plans to grow its curated list of vendors each year (while of course remaining a dog-friendly literary conference). Completing the chain spanning from author to reader are reviewers, booksellers, and libraries. Austin is home to Kirkus Reviews, a storied institution that has always been devoted to “integrity, honesty and accessible reviews written with an insider’s eye,” and smaller review organizations like Lone Star Literary Life continue to crop up. Since 1970, BookPeople has been Austin’s largest independent bookstore and remains one of the nation’s most famous indie booksellers, located downtown near the Whole Foods world headquarters. Nothing hones conversation skills like preparing a three-second greeting to the likes of Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Stephen King, and Neal Patrick Harris while they sign your book. Austin already has an extensive network of libraries, and soon it will include a $120 million flagship location downtown overlooking the Colorado River (called Lady Bird Lake) that will have reading porches, a rain harvesting system, car charging stations, and a landscaped roof. If they install nap pods, the entire city may move in. Austin’s enthusiasm for literature has never been greater. On almost any given day, one of our literary organizations will be hosting a reading with beer, music, and art. And then, once a year, we celebrate books like the finale of a fireworks show with the Texas Book Festival, started in 1995 by Laura Bush and Mary Margaret Farabee, which takes over the Texas Capitol and Congress Avenue with days of talks and readings with more than 250 authors, local food trucks, and the Lit Crawl.

66,http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/darlington-crossroads-of-nascars-confederate-flag-issue/2244405,"DARLINGTON, S.C. — Throwback paint schemes on race cars and retro logos and signs welcomed NASCAR fans when they arrived at Darlington Raceway this weekend for tonight's Sprint Cup Southern 500. The marketing campaign was designed to make one of the most storied tracks on the circuit look like the early 1970s all over again. Fans were more than happy to complete the picture, much to NASCAR's dismay. Confederate flags flew on RVs across the infield and outside the track Friday morning, as they have for decades here. The Southern 500, after all, was long known for playing Dixie as its anthem and used to feature a character named Johnny Reb — a man dressed as a Confederate soldier who stood atop the winning car with a rebel flag. So NASCAR faced a recurring quandary: How could a sport so connected to its Southern roots broaden its appeal nationally without alienating that base? ""I'd say we're always looking to make sure we're satisfying our core fans and our long-term fan at the same time as we are growing to a new audience,"" Jim Cassidy, NASCAR's senior vice president for racing operations, said Thursday. ""It's a balance."" And Darlington, as much as any track, epitomizes the struggle NASCAR has faced in trying to find that balance with an event that holds a special place in racing history. The first Southern 500 at Darlington was on Labor Day weekend in 1950. For 53 years, it was iconic, revered by some as much or more than the Daytona 500 and Coca-Cola 600 among the most important races of the year. But in 2004 NASCAR moved the holiday race to Fontana, Calif. The Southern 500 was suddenly gone. Darlington kept one race a season, with shifting dates, and the Southern 500 name came back in 2009. But the Labor Day date — after five years in California and six in Atlanta — only returned to South Carolina this year. And officials are determined not to have Confederate flags in clear view during the race broadcast. After all, NASCAR chairman Brian France has said Confederate flags were no longer welcome at tracks after a mass shooting at a church in nearby Charleston in June. For the Daytona race in July, track officials offered American flags in exchange for Confederate flags there. Darlington track president Chip Wile instituted the same program this week. On Friday, track workers asked fans to take down their flags. The reason given: They blocked sight lines. Fans were not buying it. ""If they're saying it gets in the way, people can't see across the track, how come they got (American) flags on all the race car drivers' haulers?"" said Tyler Harris, 24, of Reidsville, N.C., who flew five Confederate flags on a 30-foot pole attached to an RV in the infield. ""There's a lot of newer, younger people coming to the races now, not the old school,"" said Brian Myers, 40, of Ridgeville, S.C. ""They've got to keep everybody happy. So they're in a tough spot. I understand that. But they shouldn't ask us to take our flags down.""",2015-09-05 21:25:30,Darlington: Crossroads of NASCAR's Confederate flag issue,,22,http://www.tampabay.com/
67,http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Targeting-guns-6486096.php,"The senseless shooting of a deputy sheriff as he fills his patrol car with gas shocks and saddens Houston. An off-duty police officer shoots a mentally disturbed man as his family seeks treatment for him in a Houston hospital. A man cleaning his gun accidentally shoots and kills himself. Bexar County sheriff's deputies shoot and kill a San Antonio man who may or may not have had his hands in the air, who may or may not have been holding a knife. These random gleanings - a small sampling, to be sure - are the contributions Texas has made in the last few days to this nation's gun-violence affliction. They take their place among more than 33,000 gun deaths we tolerate every year, based on figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's more than 11,000 by homicide and 21,000 by suicide. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 297 Americans are shot daily in murders, suicides, assaults and accidents; 89 die. Those numbers are appalling. Equally appalling is the fact that we've grown accustomed to them. We still have the capacity to be shocked by mass shootings - although we can't bring ourselves to do anything about them - or by something so grotesque as two young TV journalists being shot to death on live TV, but otherwise gun carnage is simply collateral damage in a fealty to the Second Amendment that's almost religious in its intensity. Imagine, though, how Australia (30 gun deaths annually), Great Britain (41) and Japan (11) would respond to more than 30,000 of their citizens dying by gun every year. Actually, there's no need to imagine. Australia responded to a mass shooting in 1996 that left 35 people dead by enacting a comprehensive gun-control regimen that has had a dramatic effect on the rate of gun deaths. According to the Journal of Public Health Policy, Australia's firearm suicide rate dropped by half in the next seven years; the firearm homicide rate dropped almost by half. Meanwhile, we have had more than one mass shooting per day, on average, throughout 2015. (A mass shooting means that four or more people were shot.) As New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof noted recently, ""More Americans have died from guns in the United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all the wars in American history."" There will come a day when the National Rifle Association's choke-hold on craven politicians will end. We've seen it before: Whether it's seat belts and other safety measures in automobiles or the facts about the dangers of tobacco, truth and common sense eventually win out, even against the most relentless and well-funded foes. And so it will be with guns, once a new generation of elected officials summons the courage to stand up to bullies and ideologues. It won't be tomorrow, but as with gay marriage and acceptance of marijuana, it could be swift when it comes, even in gun-loving Texas. Meanwhile, Texans and Americans who understand that our gun laws are ""demented,"" to borrow Kristof's description, can continue pushing ""well-regulated"" gun ownership, to borrow from the Constitution itself. The comprehensive plan we need would include universal background checks for both private sales and gun shows to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers and other dangerous individuals; limits on gun purchases to one a month to reduce gun trafficking; stronger penalties for straw purchasers; safe storage requirements; so-called smart guns and other safety measures; waiting periods to buy a handgun, and more research on what measures actually save lives. If Congress continues to quail, states should take the lead. Of course, that won't be happening in Texas anytime soon, but even if their elected representatives ignore them, individuals need to stand up. They need to join Andy Parker, a Virginian, who vowed last week to do whatever it takes to end gun violence. The name Andy Parker may not be familiar. It was his beautiful daughter Alison who was struck down in the prime of her life, on live TV, by a deranged former colleague wielding a gun.",2015-09-05 15:34:00, Editorial: Targeting guns ,,10,http://www.chron.com/

Today, it could be even bigger. Americans want to march en masse to protest gun violence. I know this because every time there’s a mass shooting—as in every other week—women, ready to fill buses to DC, ask me to organize another march. I still hold the record for organizing the largest march in U.S. history to protest gun violence. Held on Mother’s Day, 2000, more than 750,000 angry marchers convened on the National Mall. Thousands of others from all 50 states marched in 77 support marches across the country. All to protest gun violence. Someone else want to top that? Easy. Here’s how. First, announce the march on a slow news day. Like a Labor Day. A Monday so bereft of hard news it has TV assignment editors silently praying for a shark attack on the Jersey Shore or a 12 car pile-up on the Long Island Expressway involving a Hampton’s Jitney and (fingers crossed) Alec Baldwin’s limo. News crews from CNN to Fox News packed my Labor Day news conference in 1999 when I announced I was organizing a million moms’ march. Next, give up your day job. A march will take over your life. I took leave from my paying job promoting comedy gags like “The Top Ten Ways the Y2K Will Affect Your Dog” right around the same time I took leave of my senses to put $100,000 on my Visa and MasterCard, the start-up expenses to launch a massive march. No joke. Yes. Go crazy! In an outraged, “Congress, Go to your room and clean up your mess!” kind of way. Don’t forget to call the Capitol Hill police about a permit. Same switchboard number for Congress. (202-224-3121). Most important for organizing on a large scale, recruit talented, well-connected moms (and dads) who can promote policy and politics in easy to understand terms…like an episode of Sesame Street. An “F” grade from the NRA stands for Friends. Our friends. The ones in Congress who want to protect children from gun violence. An “A” stands for…well, you get the drift. Next, pick a relatable timeframe from launch to march. Labor Day 1999 to Mother’s Day 2000 was nine months. I repeat. Nine months. Plenty of time to seriously organize. Plus, the mommy metaphor wrote its own headlines. Be patient with those clueless to America’s gun violence epidemic. I too was blissfully ignorant of the sobering statistics until a deranged white supremacist sprayed 70 bullets in under 3 minutes at day campers who were around the same ages as my children, then 4 and 5 years old. In 1999 approximately 12-15 American children and teens died each day by gunfire. In 2015 that number is down to 8-9 a day. More survive gunshots from better medical care. Others, from moms who ask before sending their children to a play date if the home has a gun and if so, is it locked up? Become a sound-bite policy expert. Not that hard. I became one after watching an episode of Nightline in which two police chiefs—one from Seattle, Washington, the other from Vancouver, Canada—compared and contrasted their respective countries background check systems for gun sales. An eye-opener. Canada’s background check system includes a 28 day waiting period while authorities check the applicant’s references which include employers, family and neighbors. If approved, then the applicant must take safety courses. Don’t we have national laws like that in the United States? All the craven politicians keep saying we do. We just need to enforce them. Well, liar, liar pants on fire. America’s laws don’t even come close. But I digress. March organizers must embrace all media, including Fox News. My favorite, “The “O’Reilly Factor.” I went on after the National Zoo shooting in 2000 (not to be confused with the 2014 shooting). While dads in lazyboys yelled “from my cold dead hands” at me, their wives and daughters lit up the march’s 50 phone lines wanting to join. I appeared again on an unrelated topic. As the publicist for a tabloid TV show, I was on to chit-chat about the Rosie O’Donnell/Donald Trump feud. (The 2007 feud, not the one in 2015). When O’Reilly introduced me as the founder of the Million Mom March, his viewers reeling from the Virginia Tech massacre, flooded the Brady Campaign’s switchboard wanting to join a march, nobody was organizing. The frazzled man fielding the calls begged me never to use the word “march” on national TV ever again. Men, as a gender, can’t organize a trip to the men’s room, much less organize a bus to DC. Marches baffle them. Some think it’s so easy that they want a march every other day—as in my favorite billionaire activist, Michael Bloomberg. At a 2009 fundraiser where we were both donors, Bloomberg wanted to know why I wasn’t organizing another march on Washington. (I was a single mom, Mr. Mayor, with a day job.) He had reason to be upset. Congress was debating a diabolical concealed carry reciprocity bill (ultimately defeated, whew!) around the same time as a mass shooting in Binghamton, the worst in New York state’s history. Then in 2012 the mass shooting that kicked us all in the gut—Newtown—had Luke Russert, a man, suggesting the time was right for another “Million Mom March.” That shout-out from Russert on MSNBC sent 1225 emails to my private account within minutes. I forwarded them to be captured by a Facebook page thrown up quickly by an Indiana mom while the rest of America was literally throwing up. Oh, if only Mark Zuckerberg wasn’t still in high school cramming for his SATs back in 2000, I am certain millions of moms marching up Capitol Hill is more frightening to a Congressman than Wayne Lapierre knocking at his door. Now that American moms have Facebook event pages, a massive march has the potential to be 10 times larger than the Million Mom March of 15 years ago. Now get ready for sticker shock. Got $3 million? That’s what my march cost in 2000. The bigger the march, the more expensive the march. Thankfully, corporate sponsors, attracted to the mom demographic, footed most of the bill. Money well-spent because it created a mega-data base of activists and donors with funds that would not have otherwise gone to a historically under-funded, un-appreciated and battle weary movement. Still want to organize a march? Then disregard the inside the Beltway naysayers who will balk, claiming marches accomplish nothing. Untrue. Statehouses across the country began moving long-stalled gun safety legislation in 2000, knowing that voting mothers were now watching. Thousands of volunteers energized by the march signed up for political campaigns that following November. Suburban moms put Al Gore over the top to win the popular vote for president. He might have won that electoral college too if not for Florida, with its hanging chads and confused senior citizens who mistakenly voted for Pat Buchanan. Got $3 million and still want to organize a march? Build it and we will come. However, if it were up to me, I would rather spend it on securing DC’s Verizon Center for a televised megamom-rally. Why? Better security. Better handicapped accessible bathrooms too. Amy Schumer, want to emcee? Like a Jerry Lewis Telethon, we could raise money on-air for a voter education fund. A $1 million dollar contribution donated anonymously to the Million Mom March in 2000 helped identify who voted to close the gun show loophole after Columbine. And who didn’t. Voting moms threw a few rascals out of Congress as a result. I would fill 19,465 of Verizon’s 20,000 seats with grieving mothers and religious leaders from every one of the 435 congressional districts. The other 535 seats, I’d save for Congress. No-shows would be publicly shamed on National TV by Tucson’s hero, Patricia Maiche, a woman who bravely wrestled with the shooter of Rep.Gabby Giffords and others, saving lives a result. The standing room only section would be reserved for survivors in wheelchairs. If the Fire Marshall objects, I’d bring in the Chicago Fire Chief, Annette Holt, a mother of a slain son. Dads, you circle outside to protect the women from the misogynistic death threats we female activists endure daily. Andy Parker, father of journalist Allison Parker, no need to arm yourself with anything other than your eloquence. Hordes of TV crews will be circling you, the rest of the outraged dads and maybe even an astronaut there too. Whether it’s another mothers’ march or the mother of all town halls, somebody’s got to step up. In a big way. America is at a rare tipping point now To quote Mr. Parker, “we should do whatever it takes” to tip it in the right direction. Got $3 million burning a hole in your pocket? Call me. I’ll reserve the venue.",2015-09-07 00:01:00,Organizing the Mother of All Protests,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

Fortunately for us all, you can have Chatter emailed to you every day. Just sign up here! Need to know: ""He just wanted to be on TV and to do a good job,"" recalled a veteran news anchorwoman and former co-worker of Vesper Flanagan's. ""Well, now he is on TV, but in the worst possible way."" CBS affiliate WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia, held a moment of silence Thursday morning exactly 24 hours after 41-year-old Vesper Flanagan apparently shot and killed two television journalists while they were on the air conducting an interview. Flanagan was a former employee at WDBJ and had previously sued for wrongful termination. After the attack, video of the shooting was posted on Flanagan's Facebook page, and a 23-page fax sent to ABC News that said Flanagan had been discriminated against for being black and being gay. He described himself as a ""human powder keg"" spurred to action by the mass shooting of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C. Hours later, he crashed his car and shot himself in the head. He died at the hospital. Today, more details are pouring in about the victims of the shooting — 24-year-old Alison Parker and Adam Ward, 27, who were a reporting team. Parker on camera; Ward behind it. They have been described as ""special people"" and both at the start of exciting new chapters in their personal lives. Parker had just moved in with her boyfriend of nine months. Ward was engaged to be married. Both of their partners also worked at WDBJ. Flanagan's family has apologized for the shooting and people from the gunman's past remember him as a ""different person."" Andy Parker, Alison Parker's father, has said he is going to do ""whatever it takes to get gun legislation — to shame people, to shame legislators into doing something about closing loopholes and background checks and making sure crazy people don't get guns."" Want to know: The civil services exam in India is insane. Nevermind the fact that it consists of more than 27 hours of testing, or that only .002 percent of those who registered to take the test will actually become service officers. Nevermind that it is recommended a person study for 12 hours a day for at least 18 months in order to master the answers to such pointed questions as: “In which decade was the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) founded?” What? What makes the grueling testing process so utterly remarkable is that no one really cares about the jobs at the end of it. Most people don't even know what those jobs entail. According to Sahil Grover, an MPhil student at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, “more than 90 percent of the aspirants know nothing about the services” to which they are applying. They just want to pass the test. That's it. “The only idea is, this is a prestigious exam, once you make it through everyone would start respecting you,” Grover said. Given how uninformed civil servants appear to be about their jobs — and the fact that they are rarely held accountable for their decisions — it is perhaps unsurprising that they are said to be as much a part of India's problems as corrupt politicians. Strange but true: We have all been there. That morning you log onto Facebook and immediately regret a photo posted the night before. Often these photos are from parties. Sometimes they involve unfortunate angles or inopportune chewing. More infrequently, they cost you $600. For Amirbek Isayev, that last part came true. Isayev had the audacity to turn 25 in Tajikstan where birthday parties are a problem — so much so in fact that there is a law against them. Not only did Isayev turn 25, but he actually went out for cake, stopped by a bar to join some friends for a drink, and stood idly by while two of those so-called friends smeared his face with cake. As if that wasn't enough, he posted photos of the whole affair on Facebook! It's that last bit that got him in trouble. The photos drew the ire of Tajik authorities, who found Isayev guilty of violating the 2007 ban on public birthday celebrations and fined him about $600 — or four times the average monthly salary in the impoverished country. The law “on regulation of traditions, celebrations and rituals” is aimed at reducing the financial burden on Tajik families who’ve been prone to outdo themselves over a range of celebrations. It stipulates that birthday parties must be celebrated at home among family. It says nothing (that we know of) about smearing cake on anyone's face. Want a seat at the table?

Guns http://fus.in/1hDerr6 Copied to clipboard The United States has 200 million more guns than any other country. It also has the most mass shootings. “That is not a coincidence,” says the author of a new study which proves that the more firearms per capita a nation has, the more likely mass shootings are to happen. “The United States, Yemen, Switzerland, Finland, and Serbia are ranked as the Top 5 countries in firearms owned per capita…My study found that all five are ranked in the Top 15 countries in public mass shooters per capita,” study author Adam Lankford, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Alabama, said in a statement. His findings will be presented at the American Sociological Association’s annual conference this week. The research underscores what gun control advocates and a majority of Americans have been saying for a long time now: easy access to firearms in the U.S., along with the lack of protections like universal background screenings for gun buyers, have led to institutionalized, normalized mass violence in the country. “[This analysis] can be rejected only by rage and hysteria and denial and with the Second Amendment invoked, not as a document with a specific and surprising history, but as a semi-theological dogma,” wrote Adam Gopnik in the New Yorker earlier this year. “The argument has been revealed conclusively to be between people who actually want to reduce the number of gun massacres and those who prefer an attachment to lethal symbols of power.” US has 5 percent of world’s population, but had 31 percent of its public mass shooters from 1966-2012 Lankford’s research is described as the “first quantitative analysis of all reported public mass shootings around the world that resulted in the deaths of four or more people.” A mass shooting, according to the researcher’s definition, excludes shootings in domestic settings (of which there have been many), gang-related shootings, hostage-taking incidents, robberies, and drive-by shootings. Shootings between 1966 and 2014 were analyzed for the study, using sources like the New York City Police Department’s 2012 active shooter report, the FBI’s 2014 active shooter report, and multiple international sources. “My study provides empirical evidence, based on my quantitative assessment of 171 countries, that a nation’s civilian firearm ownership rate is the strongest predictor of its number of public mass shooters,” Lankford said. “Until now, everyone was simply speculating about the relationship between firearms and public mass shootings. My study provides empirical evidence of a positive association between the two.” In analyzing the differences between shooters in the U.S. and shooters abroad, Lankford found that U.S. shooters are more likely to attack a school, movie theater or other public gathering place. Abroad, they are more likely to attack in “military settings,” which includes bases, checkpoints, and barracks. American mass shootings are also 3.6 times more likely to involve more than one weapon during a mass shooting. In the U.S., more than half the mass shootings involved more than two firearms, something which Lankford attributes to the ease of obtaining firearms in the U.S. The average amount of people killed per mass shooting was found to be lower in the U.S. (6.87 victims) than abroad (8.81 victims). That is a product of the sheer number of mass shootings that happen in the U.S., Lankford said, and partly attributed to the fact that law enforcement in the U.S. has adapted its training practices accordingly, which helps keep casualties down. Absent is any mention of how “good guy with a gun” incidents might have minimized the casualties, when an armed bystander intervenes, often killing the would-be mass shooter. These incidents, upheld by gun-rights groups as a defense for gun ownership and concealed carry laws, have in fact happened periodically. For instance, one shooting in a Colorado church in 2007 that left two dead was cut short when an armed churchgoing woman shot and killed the gunman before he could let off more shots. The gunman was armed with an assault rifle, two handguns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition. A pile of more than 4,300 confiscated illegal weapons from Los Angeles about to be melted down. Despite these outstanding cases, the answer to mass gun violence is not more people with guns, according to the research. “The most obvious implication [of the research] is that the United States could likely reduce its number of school shootings, workplace shootings, and public mass shootings in other places if it reduced the number of guns in circulation,” said Lankford. He points to the Australian approach to gun control as one that the U.S. might be able to emulate. Immediately after a mass shooting killed 35 people in that country in 1996, the nation passed comprehensive gun control laws and initiated a massive gun buyback program that reduced the total amount of firearms owned by the public in the country by 20%. “My study shows that in the wake of these policies, Australia has yet to experience another public mass shooting,” said Lankford. It’s unlikely that this analysis, or Lankford’s suggestions will make an immediate difference in Washington. The National Rifle Association, often referred to as one of the nation’s most powerful lobbying groups of all time, is blanketly opposed to the any legislation that resembles what passed in Australia, and it has the political pull to sway politicians from voting for gun control laws. This even as the U.S. has averaged about a mass shooting a day so far in 2015. What we now know is that — empirically — gun control reins in mass gun violence. That’s the diagnosis. Now Washington needs to find a way to get to the doctor.  Click to see local listings © 2021 Fusion Media Network, LLC.

Guns http://fus.in/1UR9B7H Copied to clipboard According to a poll done by consumer research firm C4, only 9% of moviegoers said they plan on going to the movies less often because of mass shooting incidents that have—or almost have—occurred over the past few years. C4 asked 500 people who see at least six movies each year to respond to questions on security, and found that 48% would pay $1 or more for better security. But just 23% said the same when asked about a $2 or more increase. That figure dropped to 19% when respondents were asked about a $3 or more spike. When asked about the specific security measures they’d like to see taken, 33% said they’d opt for metal detectors. Thirty-five percent said they’d feel comfortable with bag checks, and 16% said they want armed security guards at a theater. The survey comes soon after Universal Pictures made a controversial offer to partner with theaters that wanted more security for showings of Straight Outta Compton, and weeks after a fatal shooting in a Louisiana theater showing Trainwreck. And recently, Aurora theater shooter James Holmes was sentenced to life in prison without parole on 24 counts of murder in the first degree. Still, it seems fewer people are going to the movies overall. The Hollywood Reporter noted in January that the rate of moviegoers hit a 19-year low in 2014—although the Reporter contends that might be because 2014’s summer blockbusters were bad.

member in the back of a squad car, and even a photo of someone 
reportedly wearing ISIS gear at a deli. Yet another photo surfaced of a

late Houston Oilers defensive tackle Jeff Alm and the circumstances 
surrounding his death in December 1993. He and his childhood friend Sean Lynch were 
allegedly driving drunk on the night of Dec. 14, 1993 down 
Interstate 610 when Alm lost control of his vehicle. Lynch was ejected 
from the vehicle and died at the scene. Alm reached for a shotgun 
in the vehicle as he called 911 to report the accident. In a fit of 
remorse over Lynch's death, Alm shot and killed himself. Later rumors 
swirled that the pair were closer than friends and that there was 
something else going in the car at the time of the accident. Sadly this 
rumor made the rounds for most of the '90s and was purported to have 
been spread by EMS officials at the scene.Source: The oral history of the 1993 Houston Oilers There is a ghoulish presence on the side of Ewing Hall at the University

Claim: Signs started showing up on the doors of Tex-Mex restaurants around San Antonio, specifically Taco Cabanas and Mama Margie's, stating they would no longer serve Donald Trump supporters. Signs such as these did appear on local restaurants, but as Snopes notes and as reported in multiple mySA.com stories, the signs were hoaxes that the restaurants did not post themselves, but were put by up by Trump haters. RELATED: Fake sign telling Trump supporters to steer clear placed on favorite Tex-Mex restaurant  RELATED: Taco Cabana sign saying Donald Trump supporters will not be served is not real, company says Claim: Senator Ted Cruz calls President Barack Obama the ""N"" word during a local fundraiser. The 2015 audio recording of the incident was faked by a satire  news website and later circulated around the internet as real. According to a San Antonio Express-News report, on Dec. 16, 2012, Jesus Manuel Garcia apparently became enraged over a break up, which led to him allegedly shooting at co-workers in the China Garden restaurant where he worked. 
He apparently chased one of his co-workers across the restaurant parking lot and into the Santikos Mayan Palace 14 where he shot and wounded one patron before he was shot several times by a Bexar County deputy working security at the theater. Shown here are San Antonio Police responding to the scene. Claim: Photographs shows a Bigfoot shot and killed by a hunter in San Antonio. Outdoorsman Rick Dyer has admitted his claim that he shot a Bigfoot in San Antonio in 2012, and the resulting corpse he took on tour a year later, were fabricated. Claim: “Actor Denzel Washington made a large donation to the Fisher House Foundation after visiting Brooke Army Medical Center.” According to a San Antonio Express-News report, Washington visited Brooke Army Medical Center in December, 2004, and partook in a Purple Heart ceremony.Snopes points out that the actor also visited the Fisher House, and later made a donation. But, as the popular story goes, he did not whip out his checkbook on the spot to make the donation. Claim: “Parents of a murdered Virginia Tech co-ed unthinkingly back over another of their children on the way to the airport.” According to Snopes, this was another email fraud in the guise of a “prayer request.” The site reports that nothing about this claim checks out and that none of the students who lost their lives in the mass shooting at Virginia Tech were from Texas. Claim: “Tires or bumpers of cars parked outside gun stores are marked by gangs to later identify them for potential gun theft opportunities.” According to Snopes this claim has been making Internet rounds in various forms since 2011. The San Antonio connection is linked to a national shooting championship completion in 2011 from the National Skeet Shooting Association/National Sporting Clays Association that was held in San Antonio and is mentioned in versions of the claim. Claim: “A child who wrote to God about her deceased pet received a kind letter and a book to help her with her bereavement in response.” As reported by former San Antonio Express-News columnist Cary Clack, in 2006 following the death of the Scrivener family, Abby, their 4-year-old Meredith wrote a letter to God and included photos of the family dog.
Two weeks later the family found a package on their front porch addressed to the daughter that contained a copy of Mr. Roger’ book, “When a Pet Dies.” Claim: “Some new Wisconsin quarters contain a printing error that makes them especially valuable.” According to Snopes, in 2004 a few thousand of the more than 453 million Wisconsin quarters released by the U.S. Mint contained an aberration that had a cornstalk with an extra leaf pointing up.
The San Antonio connection is that 50 of the coins were found in the Alamo City a year later. Shown is one of the coins displayed at Lone Star Coins and Collectibles Inc. Claim: “Hundreds of decommissioned bomb-sniffing Marine Corps dogs are in need of adoption by the public.” Shown is Riley, the dog featured in ""Call of Duty: Ghosts."" A message sent out in 2012 from the Marine Corps advertised the need for people to adopt improvised explosive device sniffing dogs. Snopes points out that USA Today disproved this. However, Snopes found that in June 2014, the Marine Corps Times reported that the head of the Corps’ military working dog program was looking to adopt out their working dogs to other federal agencies. This included 200 dogs that were relocated to the dog training facility at Lackland Air Force Base. Claim: “Picking bluebonnets is illegal in Texas.” It is perfectly legal to pick bluebonnets in Texas, and San Antonio. Legend: “The protective ghosts of little children killed at a railway crossing push stalled cars off the track.” The infamous San Antonio ghost tracks where, allegedly, the spirits of kids that died in a horrific bus accident help others who get stranded on the tracks. Snopes points out that this story has its origins in a December 1938 bus accident in Salt Lake City, Utah, where 26 students were killed. The site further notes S.A.’s ghost tracks phenomenon as being only an optical illusion. Legend: “Horrified onlookers notice that the enthralling stranger dancing with a pretty girl from the village has cloven hooves.” One version of this Hellish tale takes place at in 1975 at the El Camaroncito Nite Club off Old Highway 90 and has the female dancer noticing her suitor’s “chicken feet” and screams. Others in the club scream and begin praying. The chicken footed devil disappears into the men’s room and never returns, leaving only a sulfur smell. Legend: “Brewery employees discover the body of a worker in a vat of beer.” This sudsy tale harkens back to either 1966, or 1967, when rumors were running amok at the Lone Star Brewery. A variant of the legend has the dead person as being a murder victim who had his hands and feet cut off. The rumors and outright lies spread so fast through Texas that it can be hard to keep up. Does the Texas Capitol face south to honor a horrific Texas Revolution massacre? Nah. Did a shark appear in local streets during Houston flooding last May? Definitely not. Did University of Texas at Austin medical students help rob a hard-partying student of his kidney? The Austin institution doesn’t even have a medical school!

79,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/26/virginia-tv-shooting-white-house-gun-control,"Last modified on Wed 5 Jun 2019 09.19 BST The White House on Wednesday renewed its call for stricter gun controls in the wake of the fatal shooting near Roanoke, Virginia, of two local journalists while they were broadcasting live on air. Josh Earnest, Barack Obama’s press secretary, reiterated prior statements on the epidemic of gun violence in America as the nation grappled with the latest shooting to shock the country: the killing of reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward of CBS affiliate WDBJ7‎.  “This is another example of gun violence that is becoming all too common in communities large and small all across the United States,” Earnest told reporters at his daily press briefing. “While there is no piece of legislation that will end all violence in this country, there are some commonsense things that only Congress can do that we know would have a tangible impact in reducing gun violence in this country.” Other prominent politicians and advocates against gun violence also joined the call for action, including Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who tweeted that she was “heartbroken and angry” after the shooting and called for action. Heartbroken and angry. We must act to stop gun violence, and we cannot wait any longer. Praying for the victims' families in Virginia. -H The former secretary of state later addressed the shooting while campaigning in Iowa, telling reporters she was “stricken” to think that two young people “would be murdered on live television”. “We have got to do something about gun violence. And I will take it on,” Clinton said. “There are many people who face it and know it, but then turn away.” Virginia’s governor, Terry McAuliffe, said he would continue to push for gun control during his time in office, even though he has been stymied by the state legislature in his previous efforts to expand background checks and enact tougher restrictions on firearm purchases. “I put it up again last year. It never sees the light of day,” McAuliffe, a Democrat, said during an interview with the Washington radio station WTOP. “Everyone who purchases a gun in the Commonwealth of Virginia should have to go through a background check. You go into the store, you hand your license over. It doesn’t take … but three, four, maybe five minutes maximum.” He added: “There are too many guns in the hands of people that shouldn’t have guns. There is too much gun violence in America.” Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in the head during the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, also chimed in on the horrific nature of a shooting broadcast live to the public. “Many times, they happen behind close doors, in homes and schools and movie theaters,” Giffords said in a statement with her husband Mark Kelly through their group Americans for Responsible Solutions, which works to fight gun violence. “But this time, the horror unfolded live and on air, for all to see.” The familiar statements came after Parker and Ward were shot and killed. Vicki Gardner, a third victim who was being interviewed by Parker for the segment, was in stable condition. Authorities confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the shooting suspect – a man named Vester Lee Flanagan II, who went by Bryce Williams III – died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. While details were not yet available on how the shooter obtained his weapon, a 23-page document reportedly faxed to ABC News by an individual who identified himself as both Williams and Flanagan contained the ramblings of a troubled individual. The writer noted that he put a deposit down for a firearm in June, two days after the racially motivated shooting at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The individual also invoked other American mass shootings – namely the 1999 Columbine high school massacre and the shooting in 2007 at Virginia Tech – to express his admiration for the killers in those incidents. Earnest said that while the precise details of the shooting were still unfolding, officials from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were involved in responding and tracking down the alleged shooter and expected that federal officials would support their state counterparts in the ongoing investigation. The White House has, in recent years, zeroed in on reducing gun violence as one of its top priorities. Just last month, Obama said that the failure to pass gun safety laws was his “biggest frustration” as president – a sentiment Earnest said on Wednesday continues to stand. “The president’s views on this certainly haven’t changed,” the White House spokesman said, adding that a “very vocal” minority of the US population “has a lot of sway in Congress when it comes to issues related to guns”. “The president’s found that disappointing and frustrating, principally because he believes it’s bad public policy for us to not take commonsense steps to address what I think we all acknowledge is a pretty significant problem,” Earnest said. “The president has also been disappointed that our political system hasn’t responded in the way that he would like. There’s clear majorities in both the Democratic and Republican parties, according to many polls, for these policies. There are even some polls that indicate that there are clear majorities of gun owners that support some of these commonsense steps, but yet we haven’t seen Congress take action and that has been the source of significant frustration.” Obama made his most significant push for stricter gun laws after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, when a gunman claimed the lives of 20 children and six educators. The US Senate failed to pass universal background checks the following April, despite the support of 90% of Americans, and Congress has since made no effort to revisit the issue despite several high-profile mass shootings over the last two years – a series of them in the last couple of months alone. Obama has taken limited executive action to curtail gun violence, but Earnest acknowledged on Wednesday that the president “has reached a logical conclusion” that Congress is unlikely to take any action soon.",2015-08-26 16:27:34,White House renews call for gun control after Virginia TV shooting,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
80,http://www.salon.com/2015/08/19/wing_nuts_with_guns_dreams_of_a_race_war_inside_the_dangerous_obsessions_of_right_wing_extremists/,"Even as we round the corner into the final year of the Obama administration, organized and semi-organized racists continue to rage against the election of the first African-American president. This Summer, their specified target is the Black Lives Matter movement, and the racist groups in question happen to be gun-toting Oath Keepers and Confederate flag fetishists. Let's start with the Confederate flag crackpots. This past weekend, Confederate flag supporters, who insisted they totally aren't racists, trolled African-Americans in Sunrise, Florida. A group called the South Florida Rednecks launched a motorcycle convoy with their bikes and pickup trucks festooned in the Confederate flag, which is totally not inflammatory at all. But when Black Lives Matter protesters appeared, Raw Story reported that some of the Southern Florida Rednecks brandished knives and firearms, clearly to intimidate the protesters. What makes the flag people particular volatile is the self-evident fact that they're an embattled and rapidly dying sub-faction of hate-mongers in deep denial about their archaic symbol of ""heritage."" (Heritage meaning slavery, treason, Jim Crow and southern racism.) And the louder they become, the tighter the walls close in around them -- which could further provoke them into snapping. Given how the most recent assault on the flag began with a mass shooting, it's reasonable to worry that it might not be the only time a Lost Cause-obsessed rebel lashes out at people of color, and given how the Black Lives Matter protesters are extremely visible now, it might benefit the flag rednecks gathered in organized rallies to set a few ground rules about protecting their dastardly heritage without the use of weapons. Speaking of which, news broke during last week's anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown that Oath Keepers appeared in Ferguson -- fully armed. By way of review, the Oath Keepers are considered a militia group affiliated with the patriot movement and composed of former military and law enforcement officials who've each pledged an oath to disobey any laws they deem to be in violation of their constitutional rights. (They sound hilarious at parties.) Who knows what the hell would've happened if a non-white group showed up armed with AR-15 semiautomatic rifles, given that Ferguson has seen more than its fair share of unarmed, peaceful protesters pepper-sprayed and incarcerated. Late last week, Ferguson law enforcement ordered the Oath Keepers to stow their rifles while inside Ferguson city limits. However, on Monday, the head of St. Louis County's Oath Keepers chapter, Sam Andrews, announced that the group wants to arm 50 Black protesters as part of a political demonstration later this month, and announced their intention to deliberately provoke police officers. Do we really need to outline what's going on here? Throughout the history of the United States, there's always been talk about a forthcoming race war. In recent years, however, the existence of social media and the amplified shrieking of the conservative entertainment complex have combined to open a gaping window of legitimacy for both race wars and wars against the U.S. government, which is currently and not-insignificantly run by an African-American president. By the way, I'm old enough to remember how there wasn't a peep from any of these maniacs during the Bush years. In fact, any anti-government rhetoric was vocally shouted down by Dixie Chicks-haters and Bush-supporters, who insisted that we should never criticize the commander-in-chief while troops were in harm's way. Hell, personalities like Bill Maher were summarily fired for daring to utter an off-handed criticism of our military leaders. Now, today, the same weirdos who were accusing Michael Moore or Nancy Pelosi of being unpatriotic for not supporting the Iraq War are rending garments over the Jade Helm ""conspiracy"" and a military takeover of Texas. Worse yet, an incendiary Venn diagram of Confederate flag suppoerters, armed Oath Keepers, and members of the Alex Jones conspiracy theory goon squad appear to be forming a perfect storm that's hastily moving closer to African-American activists, chiefly Black Lives Matter protesters. It's becoming increasingly evident that right-wing extremists and militia radicals are determined to touch off some sort of violent conflict involving black activists and law enforcement, with Black protesters as either targets or as convenient patsies. With the radicalization of the far-right, especially during the last six years, the eliminationist rhetoric that jet-blasts around the clock from Fox News Channel, AM talk radio and various social media groups has begun to turn a corner. Now they are actively trying to foment mass armed confrontations. Now, it’s entirely possible the Oath Keepers will either be prevented by law enforcement from handing out firearms to protesters, or it could be that it’s all a big bluff, that none of the Ferguson protesters have even the remotest of interest in participating in this Oath Keeper protest. But what matters here is the intention. And the intention is to incite violence, in an already tense atmosphere, by a right-wing hate group that has zero interest in the future of civil rights -- or black lives, for that matter.

This new policy will not make movie-goers safer but statistically put them at greater risk. This change comes after “four intruders barged into a screening … and revved a leaf blower and yelled out in the dark.” And how exactly would a bag check have prevented these fools from coming in the back door or, literally through the ticket taker, if it was a chainsaw, as feared? The article mentions the recent mass shooting in a Louisiana theater but fails to acknowledge that it was a “Gun Free Zone.” Last October, the Crime Prevention Research Center released data showing that 92 percent of all mass public shootings from 2009-14 occurred in gun-free zones. These attackers may be evil but they obviously aren’t completely crazy, knowing that the greatest damage they can do will be in an environment where they have the weapons, and their prey is defenseless. If Regal truly wants “increased safety” for its patrons it should drop the bag check and place large signs out front that offers a 10 percent discount for active or retired law enforcement (who carry concealed weapons) and all CCW holders (who go through extensive and thorough background checks and training). All have an extremely high safety rate with the guns they carry. Announcing that Regal is now a gun-free zone just puts its patrons at serious risk. So, goodbye, Regal, as I have no intention of becoming that “duck in a barrel” for some crazed gunman looking for an easy target. I’m going to buy some more Netflix stock and short Regal Entertainment Group stock right now. That’s a safe move.

83,http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2015/08/25/bill-metzger-i-support-full-concealed-carry-gun-rights-on-dcccd-campuses,"By dallasnews Administrator 7:05 PM on Aug 25, 2015 CDT As a trustee for the Dallas County Community College District, I take my position very seriously. Serving our community is a priority of mine. Being a citizen in the United States of America, however, is an even higher priority. If a mass shooting were to take place on one of our campuses, I will not be the trustee who looks into the eyes of a victim’s family and says that I didn’t do everything I could to have prevented such a tragedy. In her recent op-ed column, instructor Joanna Cattanach — like others who try to call into question our Second Amendment rights — fails to understand the importance of this amendment. Instead, she and others play on the field of emotions rather than focus on the security of our students. Let me remind Cattanach and everyone who reads this: Gun violence happens only in gun-free zones. It would be more accurate to call them target zones instead because, time and time again, we have seen innocent lives lost because those who are trained to operate a firearm are forbidden from carrying one. For those who do not remember, there was an incident that happened here in Texas over two decades ago. I am proud to call Suzanna Hupp a dear friend, and I will never forget the tragedy that she and her family faced one dark day at a Luby’s in Killeen. On Oct. 16, 1991, George Hennard drove a pickup through a plate-glass window and proceeded to kill 23 innocent people while wounding another 27. Hupp was there that day to have lunch with her parents. She was trained to use a firearm, but because the law forbade her to carry it, she was forced to leave her handgun in the car. She could have lost her license to practice medicine by keeping the gun with her. This inability to carry a concealed weapon kept Hupp from taking down a delusional psychopath intent on death and destruction. I guarantee, looking back, she would have gladly traded her medical license in order to have saved her mother, father and others. Many people needlessly lost someone they love. Their tears would not have been necessary had Hupp’s Second Amendment rights not been denied that fateful day. Let that soak in. Fast forward to other shootings, including those on education campuses: Columbine High School, Virginia Tech University, Sandy Hook Elementary. All of these have one thing in common: They happened in gun-free zones. Cattanach writes that “it is absurd for a 21-year old freshman to have a handgun in a classroom.” What is more absurd is that 21-year-old being unable to protect himself and his classmates if someone opens fire. She fails to mention that the law says that in order to carry a weapon on campus they must first have a concealed carry permit. In order to get one, a Texan must prove to the state that he or she has no criminal history and is proficient in the use of a firearm, of sound mind and able to pass a background check. Between the years 1996 and 2011, nearly 4.3 million Texans applied for concealed carry licenses. During that time, there were only 30 incidents of a murder committed with a firearm by someone with a permit. That is a rate of .0007 percent. I think we would all be happy with a crime rate that low. I sincerely hope Cattanach would agree. As a trustee, I will play a role in determining the policy for campus carry on the Dallas County Community College District campuses. My proposal is to place no restrictions on the right of students to carry concealed weapons on campus. Cattanach says she wants the ability to walk into a classroom that is safe. I agree. Students’ ability to protect themselves is exactly what helps ensure that safety. Bill Metzger is a trustee for the Dallas County Community College District.

Over the decades, we have systematically taken steps to make cars safer: We adopted seatbelts and airbags, limited licenses for teenage drivers, cracked down on drunken driving and established roundabouts and better crosswalks, auto safety inspections and rules about texting while driving. Let us leave to one side that Americans do not enjoy an enumerated constitutional right to own cars, and ignore also that gun ownership is far, far more heavily regulated than “toys and mutual funds, ladders and swimming pools,” and instead focus on just how silly this comparison is. Cars and toys and ladders and swimming pools are dangerous by accident. Those things can hurt people, yes. But they do so when the user makes an error or when the manufacturer has got something wrong. Guns, by contrast, are explicitly designed to kill and to hurt things. That is their sole purpose. The problem with firearms in the United States is not that they are randomly going off all over the place like a cheap plastic firework, but that too many people are using them to do exactly what they are supposed to do. Each year, America plays host to about 20,000 gun-performed suicides and 10,000 gun-performed murders. These happen because people point guns at themselves or at other people and then pull the trigger. As of today, there were at least 300 million firearms in circulation, most of which work extremely well. You can’t stop their abuse with better engineering. Not that this greatly matters, for Kristof’s focus on regulation appears to be little more than a rhetorical ruse. Throughout, he is noticeably careful to avoid words such as “ban” or “confiscate,” and he makes an effort to come across as if he merely wants the same sort of industrial oversight that is applied elsewhere. Toward the end, though, the mask slips. He writes: We need universal background checks with more rigorous screening, limits on gun purchases to one a month to reduce trafficking, safe storage requirements, serial number markings that are more difficult to obliterate, waiting periods to buy a handgun — and more research on what steps would actually save lives. If the federal government won’t act, states should lead. Australia is a model. In 1996, after a mass shooting there, the country united behind tougher firearm restrictions. The Journal of Public Health Policy notes that the firearm suicide rate dropped by half in Australia over the next seven years, and the firearm homicide rate was almost halved. Did you notice the sleight of hand there? In the first of these two paragraphs, Kristof is Mr. Moderation and he Just Wants Things to Work Better. He’s for improved serial numbers and tighter storage rules and stricter screening requirements and targeted purchase delays. But then, in the next, he’s praising Australia, which country not only outlawed the sale of most mainstream firearms but indulged in the forceful confiscation of those that had already been bought. Suggesting that you’re for limited gun control and then mentioning Australia in the next breath is akin to suggesting you’re for extending alcohol abuse education programs and then lionizing Prohibition. It makes no sense. Which is it, Nick? Do you want my guns to have better etched serial numbers, or do you want the police to come to my door and take them away by force? Time to decide. Note: Kristof’s glib suggestion that Australia’s gun control laws lowered the gun-related murder and suicide rates is hotly disputed. The overall rates certainly went down (as is the case pretty much everywhere over the same time period), but academics still disagree as to whether this is related to the confiscation. The University of Melbourne, for example, found that there was “no significant effect.” Get our conservative analysis delivered right to you.

After a showing of her movie Trainwreck was shot up by a misogynistic drifter, Schumer promised the world that she would henceforth speak out. Standing next to her cousin, Democratic New York senator Chuck, at a hastily arranged press conference, the actress apologized profusely for having been silent hitherto. “These are my first public comments on the issue of gun violence,” she told the press, “but I promise you they will not be my last.” And so, to great applause, her star continued to rise. True to her word, Schumer has been vocal of late. Asked by a journalist in Switzerland why the United States had not imposed draconian gun restrictions, she plumped for a familiar contention: “I think,” she said casually, “it’s money.” Oh dear. One can only imagine that Schumer would have benefited from inserting a period of study between her promise to speak out and her making good on the pledge. By her own insistence, Schumer hopes only to change the manner in which the background check system is run. She is not — at least not yet — contemplating advocating an all-out ban. That being so, one has to wonder where the “money” comes in to her theory. If we were at present debating the prohibition of firearms, then the financial health of the nation’s gun companies would surely be at stake. But we’re not. Rather, we are discussing altering the way in which violent and mentally ill people get hold of the firearms that are already on the market. What can she mean? Presumably, Schumer is resting her argument upon one of the more witless ideas in all of American politics: the contention that gun manufacturers oppose stricter laws governing who may buy firearms so as to keep their market as big as possible. Gun sellers, this peculiar theory goes, are far more interested in taking the few dollars that the crazy or violent among their patrons can provide than they are in saving the lives of the innocent. As such, the government must step in to ensure that profits are not made at the expense of the public good. One can only imagine that Schumer would have benefited from inserting a period of study between her promise to speak out and her making good on the pledge. This, frankly, is nonsense. All things considered, there is simply no way that the benefit of adding a few undesirables to the customer base could outweigh the cost of fighting the more draconian measures that are invariably proposed after a mass shooting. Forget the caricature of the soulless arms dealer that Everytown and their ilk like to promulgate, and look instead at the question as a dull business calculation: What gun manufacturer in its right mind would want the negative publicity that attaches itself to the sort of massacres that are committed by society’s outcasts? The answer, obviously, is “None.” Were the NRA and its friends really about increasing their bottom lines at the expense of everything else, they wouldn’t prattle on about freedom; they’d accept proposals such as Schumer’s with alacrity. Indeed, were it not for the remarkable political and commercial pressure that their customers impose — this is the real reason that the “gun lobby” is against further controls — the firearms industry would be more than likely to champion stricter rules of its own volition. Each and every time I hear somebody say that the “gun lobby” opposes universal background checks because it wants to increase its profits, I have first to laugh out loud, and then to wonder on which political planet the speaker is presently living. Had Chuck Schumer gotten his way after the abomination at Sandy Hook, pretty much every single firearms transaction in the United States would now require an attendant background check. The consequences of this change would have been twofold: 1) Because each sale, transfer, or gift would have attracted a mandatory fee, second-hand firearms would necessarily have become more expensive to buy — thereby providing a boon to those who make new ones; and 2) The bigger corporations — Walmart, Gander Mountain, Bass Pro, Cabela’s, etc. — would have set themselves up as the most reputable (and cheap) facilitators of the transfer process, thereby taking advantage of a brand new, government-created market. If it makes her feel virtuous, Schumer can believe that her preferred proposals would stick it to the moneyed interests, but in truth, they would do little more than to expand those interests’ profits.  Schumer’s ill-considered diagnosis is not the only glaring error that she has made of late. One of her latest sketches, titled “Ask If Birth Control Is Right for You,” depicts the actress struggling with all the necessary steps that are placed in the way of women who hope to obtain birth control from a pharmacy. At the end of what turns into an absurdly long quest — and having had to ask all and sundry for permission — Schumer finally gets her prescription . . . only to watch a little boy walk into the same store and be given a handgun, no questions asked. “Remember,” the pharmacist says casually to the child, “that’s your right!” Such as it is, the humor here derives from the supposed absurdity of its being more difficult to get hold of birth control than to purchase a firearm. Unfortunately for Schumer, that simply isn’t true. Leaving aside for a moment that the most vocal advocates of over-the-counter birth control have been Schumer’s ideological enemies, the gun-buying process in the United States is in fact far, far more complex than the sketch’s makers appear to believe. In order to purchase a handgun, an American must be 21 years of age, fill in a bunch of federal and state forms, hand over identification, and submit to a criminal background check. If Schumer thinks that it’s hard to get hold of the pill from a CVS, she should try buying a Glock from Walmart. Presumably, apologists for the spot will meet these objections with the insistence that “it’s only a joke.” But it’s really not — it’s satire, and satire only works when it’s internally consistent. Should Schumer wish to keep harping on this question, she will need to study up. #related#Likewise, if she wishes to do anything other than strike a feel-good pose, she would benefit from a broader understanding of what exactly kills reform measures in the United States. In a press release touting the ideas to which she has put her name, her cousin Chuck suggested that the Americans “desperately need to improve the background check system, which helps prevent the adjudicated mentally ill and violent criminals from getting their hands on a dangerous weapon.” In order to do this, Schumer suggested, the national database needs to be more comprehensively populated. As one might expect, this is unlikely to be popular with Second Amendment advocates who fear that the government will abuse any power that it is given. But, as Reason’s J D. Tuccille establishes today, such ideas are also anthema to many mental health professionals, who worry that “individuals might avoid seeking help if they’re worried that treatment will end up as an entry in a government database,” and that “so might the family and friends of troubled people who think a loved one needs care.” When people realize “just how arbitrary the use of government records can be,” Tuccille notes, they may well come to believe that the changes “could make things worse.” A similar fate may well await Amy Schumer’s foray into the debate.  — Charles C.

91,http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-and-the-amazing-alex-jones,"To revisit this article, select My Account, then To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories By William Finnegan On December 2nd, while the awful news from San Bernardino was erupting, bit by unconfirmed bit, I was surprised by the crisp self-assurance of a couple of bloggers whose names were new to me. They were on it—number of victims, names of shooters, police-radio intercepts. Soon, though, the bloggers veered off from the story that other news sources were slowly, frantically putting together. The information being released by the authorities did not match the information the bloggers were unearthing, and the latter quickly deduced that, like other “mass shootings” staged by the government, in Newtown, Connecticut, and elsewhere, this was a “false flag” operation. The official account was fiction. One Web site that carried the work of these “reporters” was called Infowars. I made do with other sources for news. But I kept an eye on Infowars and its proprietor, Alex Jones, who is a conspiracy theorist and radio talk-show host in Austin, Texas. Jones’s guest on his show the morning of the shooting had been, as chance would have it, Donald Trump. Jones had praised Trump, claiming that ninety per cent of his listeners were Trump supporters, and Trump had returned the favor, saying, “Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.” Jones’s amazing reputation arises mainly from his high-volume insistence that national tragedies such as the September 11th terror attacks, the Oklahoma City bombing, the Sandy Hook elementary-school shooting, and the Boston Marathon bombing were all inside jobs, “false flag” ops secretly perpetrated by the government to increase its tyrannical power (and, in some cases, seize guns). Jones believes that no one was actually hurt at Sandy Hook—those were actors—and that the Apollo 11 moon-landing footage was faked. Etcetera. Trump also trades heavily in imaginary events and conspiracy theories. He gained national traction on the American right by promoting the canard that President Obama was born outside the United States—a race-baiting lie that the candidate still toys with on Twitter. But birtherism is only the best-known among Trump’s large collection of creepy political fairy tales. You’ve probably heard the one about vaccines and autism. He even pushed that during a Presidential primary debate, on national television. Do you really believe that Obama won the 2012 election fairly? Wrong. Fraud. (At the same time, it’s Mitt Romney, total loser, who let everyone down.) Bill Ayers, not Obama, wrote “Dreams from My Father.” There is no drought in California, and the Chinese, outwitting us per usual, invented the concept of global warming to undermine American manufacturing. And so on. Does Donald Trump actually believe any of this? Or is he laughing up his sleeve as apoplectic fact-checkers throw themselves into the thankless work of disproving his absurdities? To cover himself, he prefaces his more outlandish remarks with disclaimers like “I hear” or “A lot of people think.” (To back up his contention that “thousands and thousands” of Muslims publicly celebrated the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey, he tweeted a link to Infowars. His source for the California-drought denial also seemed to be Infowars.) The Huffington Post assigned a team of researchers to document the fabrications in a single hour-long Trump appearance on CNN. They counted seventy-one, or one fib for every hundred and sixty-nine words uttered (including Anderson Cooper’s words). Huff Post readers were presumably appalled, but were any Trump supporters given pause about the character of their man by this brain-fogging list of falsehoods? It seems doubtful. Trump is playing a different game. He gestures toward beliefs, hunches, prejudices, and constituencies on the margins. He is playing to Americans who do not trust the media or traditional information sources, such as the government. He offers alternative narratives, fantasies that shock and satisfy. He entertains. On “Meet the Press,” after Chuck Todd asked him for evidence supporting his claim that a protester at one of his rallies had ties to the Islamic State, Trump said, “All I know is what’s on the Internet.” He said that. Even after Trump (and Sean Hannity, of Fox News) fell victim to a joke—a parody news story “reporting” that two hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees would be settled on U.S. Indian reservations—he continued to repeat the bogus figure for months. (He knew better than to touch, from the same Web site, “Trump: I Would Have Prevented the Asteroid from Killing the Dinosaurs.”) His appetite for facts appears to be tiny. In a GQ profile of Hope Hicks, his spokeswoman, by Olivia Nuzzi, Trump’s daily news briefing is described as printouts of “30 to 50 Google News results for ‘Donald J. Trump.’ ” Trump goes at the items with a marker and, according to a GQ source, “He reads something he doesn’t like by a reporter, and it’s like, ‘This motherfucker! All right, fine. Hope?’ He circles it. ‘This guy’s banned! He’s banned for a while.’ ” So what Trump knows can perhaps be narrowed further. He knows what a Google search of his own name turns up. To date, he has “banned,” in addition to many individual reporters, the Washington Post, Univision, BuzzFeed, Politico, The Daily Beast, The Huffington Post, and the Des Moines Register. Trump’s groundless insinuations hit a new low last week, after the mass shooting in Orlando, when he repeatedly suggested that President Obama secretly supports the Islamic State. This idea can be found in odd corners of the Internet—it is gospel on Infowars—but Trump’s version of it provoked such a storm of criticism, including from fellow-Republicans, that he felt obliged to tweet a link to a report from Breitbart News, a hapless dispenser of right-wing agitprop, headlined “HILLARY CLINTON RECEIVED SECRET MEMO STATING OBAMA ADMIN ‘SUPPORT’ FOR ISIS.” The memo in question was a declassified 2012 field report from Iraq, compiled by an unspecified source at the Defense Intelligence Agency. ISIS, as now constituted, did not exist at the time. The field report described the state of the Syrian opposition, made no policy recommendations, and could not in any way be interpreted as “stating” American “support” for ISIS or for its predecessor, Al Qaeda in Iraq. Michael Morell, a former C.I.A. director, demolished the Breitbart story, and Trump, in a column for Politico. But the notion that the United States secretly supports ISIS (ladies and gentlemen, please disregard those thousands of air strikes against ISIS by U.S. bombers) is not confined to the loonier quarters of the American right. It’s a powerful line of Iranian government propaganda, disseminated and widely believed among Iraqi Shiites, who proclaim it even in parliament in Baghdad. Does Donald Trump know anything about this? Unlikely. He is an insult machine, not a policy wonk. He may know, on some level, that the nonsense he speaks and tweets is nonsense, but that doesn’t mean he actually knows anything else about the world. He has gut instincts for pleasing members of a fact-averse crowd—for speaking what’s on their minds. He seems to be a narcissist of bottomless insecurity and need. His fast-twitch response to the Orlando massacre showed a man devoid of the most basic empathy. The idea that he might come to power is, to say the least, unsettling. Earlier this month, Senator Mark Kirk, the Illinois Republican, had heard enough. “Given my military experience,” Kirk announced, “Donald Trump does not have the temperament to command our military or our nuclear arsenal.” It has been customary, since shortly after the dawn of the nuclear age, for major-party Presidential candidates to begin receiving classified briefings on matters of national security—threats, concerns, ongoing operations, covert programs. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, has confirmed that briefing teams are preparing to meet with Clinton and Trump immediately after the nominating Conventions. Unlike Clinton, Trump has never been privy to classified intelligence. He may not think he actually needs to be briefed. “I know more about ISIS than the generals do,” he said at one of his rallies. “Believe me. I’m good at war. I’ve had a lot of wars of my own. I’m really good at war.” Still, Trump has expressed eagerness to begin his meetings with military and intelligence officials. His enthusiasm is reportedly not entirely reciprocated. “He completely misunderstands the military profession that he would head if he were the president,” Robert Killebrew, a retired Army colonel, told the Huffington Post. Dan Senor, a national-security aide to George W. Bush, said recently that “there should be serious concern” about giving Trump classified briefings. With his stream-of-consciousness speaking style and his bizarre relationship to information, Trump will not necessarily be discreet, or put the national interest first. This, it seems safe to say, is an unprecedented situation. And we are still speaking only of the campaign. By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

          / AP BERLIN -- Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged Thursday to do ""everything humanly possible"" to ensure security in Germany following a string of attacks - including two carried out by asylum-seekers and claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group, which she said mocked the country that took in the assailants. Merkel promised at a news conference to do everything to clear up the ""barbaric acts,"" find out who was behind them and bring them to justice. Germany owes that not just to victims and relatives and other Germans, but also to other refugees, she said. The attacks have brought Merkel's policy of welcoming refugees under renewed criticism. More than 1 million came to Germany last year, although the influx has since slowed dramatically. Merkel said that Germany will ""stick to our principles"" and give shelter to those who deserve it. She said, though, that the fact two men who came to Germany seeking shelter carried out attacks claimed by IS ""mocks the country that took them in."" Merkel said she will stick to her insistence last year that Germany ""will manage"" the challenges it faces. The government, she added, ""will do everything humanly possible to ensure security in our free, democratic state of law."" ""The fact that the events caused great insecurity ... fear, isn't in question. But fear can't be a good counsel for political action,"" she said. The chancellor cut short her vacation this week to hold her annual summer news conference. She had faced criticism from opponents for her muted response to four violent attacks that shook the country over the past 10 days. Also on Thursday, Bavarian officials pledged to hire hundreds of extra police officers and urged tougher background checks on asylum-seekers as they presented an anti-terror plan following the four attacks. Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said his state - where three of the four attacks took place - would hire some 2,000 additional police officers by 2020, improve police officers' equipment and create new offices to fight Muslim extremism and cybercrime. He also called for tougher background checks on asylum-seekers and new strategies to deport criminal asylum-seekers more easily. Three of the four attacks were committed by asylum-seekers. Merkel said of the plan that ""there are a lot of things on which we agree."" Two of the attacks - an ax attack near Wuerzburg that wounded five and a suicide bombing that injured 15 outside a bar in Ansbach - were the first in Germany to be claimed by the Islamic State group. Both of the attackers were killed. In two other attacks - a mass shooting in Munich that claimed 10 lives, including the attacker's, and the stabbing of a woman at a restaurant in Reutlingen - the motive is still unclear but Islamic extremism is not suspected.

An amnesty would generate more taxes for the government and more cheap workers for businesses, according to a pitch from a construction executive and various Koch network activists that sidelines the interests of American employees. As we wait for the wheels of justice to do their proper grinding, we might look back on former Vice President Joe Biden’s record, which sheds light on his long-standing association with crony capitalism. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is “not nearly as moderate as she claims to be”  Breitbart News senior contributor and author of the New York Times bestseller Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite Peter Schweizer explained during a Monday appearance on Breitbart News Daily. This is part of an ambitious plan by incoming President Ursula von der Leyen for the EU to become the world’s first Zero Carbon entity. Carolina Panthers Owner David Tepper, has a reported net worth of $11.6 billion. However, despite that, the South Carolina Senate has decided to approve a large package of tax breaks to help the Panthers move their headquarters and practice facilities to South Carolina. With the help of some other local, socialist demagogues Ocasio-Cortez killed something her own constituents wanted by wide margins. This is a disaster for the people who currently reside in these communities, a disaster you have to try and imagine happening to you, to your way of life, to your neighborhood — and then imagine being forced to pay for it. UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove has declared war on crony capitalism. So much for draining the D.C. swamp. Right now, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is rewriting some rules that will screw over Trump-supporting rural voters’ access to some broadband services. Irvine Company and the State of California appear ready to go all-in with massive incentives to attract Amazon to build a $5-billion second headquarters for 50,000 employees in Orange County. Covered California is so desperate to keep insurance companies on its Obamacare exchange that the state plans to guarantee profits to the giant corporations. Slowly, deliciously, like a leech starved of blood, the renewable energy industry is withering away and dying. It can only survive through government enforced subsidies or bribe-incentives. Once those dry up, so does its trade. On Friday’s Breitbart News Daily, Peter Schweizer discussed President Trump’s attendance of the G7 summit, and the FBI naming the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner as a “person of interest” in the Russia investigation. On Monday’s Breitbart News Daily, Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer discussed President Trump’s appointment of former Alabama Congressman Spencer Bachus to the board of directors for the Export-Import Bank. President Obama and his mouthpieces have embarked on a bizarre scheme to hypnotize America into forgetting the many scandals of his presidency. They seem to think that intoning “this administration hasn’t had a scandal” over and over again will make history disappear. It’s the lamest Jedi Mind Trick ever, and is being pushed on people who know Star Wars is just a movie. Many states usually squander millions to bribe companies to bring in factories that will employ thousands of blue-collar workers, but California’s ‘Go-Biz’ program will squander a quarter of a billion dollars this year to add just a small number of high-paying, mostly white-collar jobs. Jeff Cox writes at CNBC.com that a speech delivered in 2014 by Donald Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon offers a glimpse into how the new Trump administration may approach Wall Street bailouts and financial reform. Buzzfeed reporter J. Lester Feder provides a transcript of a speech given by Donald Trump’s new chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon in the summer of 2014 before a conference at the Vatican focused on poverty. Bannon’s remarks predicted the coming populist movements and detailed how the concurrent forces of militant radical Islamic, the corrupt crony capitalism of “the Party of Davos,” and the dehumanizing secularization of the West were all converging into a global conflict. The Oracle Corporation is using its deep financial resources to fund the “Google Transparency Project,” which has set up headquarters in Washington, D.C. with a mission to “out” Google’s dicey lobbying practices and expose crony relationships with President Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. America’s rush to renewables has invited corruption and fraud. Let me tell you the worst thing about the climate change scam.

Prior to Paul Ryan’s election to House Speaker, American victims of illegal alien crime warned conservatives against supporting Ryan’s Speakership, given his two-decade-long history of pushing for open borders. At an October press conference just days before Ryan’s election as Speaker, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has now laid forth his agenda for the Republican Congress—and while his advocates have praised him as a forward-thinking, public relations-savvy replacement for predecessor Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), his speech on Thursday didn’t show it. GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina came out swinging against President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for politicizing the mass shooting in California. “Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the [S]ecretary is right, and that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails.” I remember having a conversation with a local city official in Kentucky when the Kelo Supreme Court decision came down. Conservatives, myself included, were outraged that the Supreme Court had wrongly allowed using eminent domain to take private property from one private property owner and give it to another private owner.

96,https://www.salon.com/2015/08/27/the_american_religion_of_guns_money_has_blinded_us_to_an_epidemic_of_death/,"Another day, another horrific shooting. An angry man with a grudge against his former workplace killed his former co-workers as they did their jobs. It's so sickeningly common there's even a name for this very specific form of mass killing: ""going postal"" after a series of workplace gun massacres by postal workers going back to the 1980s. Yesterday's  had the unique and extra-disturbing characteristic of first taking place during a live TV spot and then further unfolding on twitter and Facebook where the shooter posted video of the murders from his own point of view. He was a failed celebrity who used all the modern forms of media to document his depraved acts. But the unusual public nature of this particular crime does not mean that similar gun murders aren't an everyday occurrence. The Washington Post published a shocking statistic yesterday: In the 238 days of 2015 America has had 247 mass shootings. This is happening more than once a day. We are so inured to it that we don't hear of them most of the time unless there is something conspicuously different about it. (This is very likely attributable to the depressing fact that the vast majority of mass killings are perpetrated by men murdering innocent women and children in their personal lives.) Chris Hayes featured some alarming statistics on his show last night. He pointed out that despite the fact the US is average among other industrialized countries in virtually every crime and only have 5% of the world's population, we have had 31% of the mass shootings since 1966.  You don't have to be an expert to see that the the fact that we lead the world in  civilian gun ownership with 88.8 guns per 100 people  (the next highest is Yemen at 54.8 per 100) has something to do with it. Our leaders and would-be leaders reacted to this terrible crime in various ways. President Obama, clearly depressed at having to make yet another statement like this, said, ""It breaks my heart every time you read or hear about these kinds of incidents."" He then added, ""What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism,"" which may be the most radical thing he's said while in office. It's obviously true, but it's been taboo to say it. Jeb Bush very weirdly shrugged his shoulders, signed autographs and smiled for pictures as he impatiently responded to reporters' questions. Most of the others on the GOP side tweeted condolences and made the expected statements of support for the families and co-workers. Bernie Sanders told the Hill,""I am saddened by the senseless deaths of Alison Parker and Adam Ward. Jane and I have their families and friends in our thoughts.” Hillary Clinton went even farther, expressing her personal horror at the event and then, as she did after Charleston, gave a very strong statement: There is so much evidence that if guns were not so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could just put some time out between the person who's upset because he got fired or the domestic abuse or whatever other motivation may be working on someone who does this, then maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage...We have got to do something about gun violence in America and I will take it on."" Unfortunately, even the shock of a man gunning down rooms full of first graders was not enough to get us to face up to our problem. And there's really one man who bears most of the responsibility for that: the head of the NRA Wayne LaPierre. After the Newtown massacre, most Americans believed it was inconceivable that nothing would be done. There was tremendous momentum to start making some necessary changes. But as a recent PBS Frontline documentary called ""Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA"" put it, LaPierre would have none of it: NARRATOR: His advisers wanted him to lie low, but LaPierre had a very different idea. Expecting trouble, he hired personal security guards, and headed into Washington. ROBERT DRAPER, The New York Times Magazine: Without telling anyone, LaPierre himself staged a press conference in Washington, D.C. NARRATOR: The media gathered. Many expected a chastened and conciliatory LaPierre. ROBERT DRAPER: I think there was an assumption that, surely, he’s going to throw the gun safety advocates, and for that matter the Newtown parents, some kind of bone. NARRATOR: But LaPierre had something else in mind. WAYNE LaPIERRE: The only way — the only way — to stop a monster from killing our kids is to be personally involved and invested in a plan of absolute protection. The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. ED O’KEEFE: And he almost immediately goes right back to what they usually say, which is that the answer to this is more guns. WAYNE LaPIERRE: What if, when Adam Lanza started shooting his way into Sandy Hook elementary school last Friday, he’d been confronted by qualified armed security? SHERYL GAY STOLBERG, The New York Times: His comments are aimed directly at the gun owners of America, to rile them up, to get them behind the NRA’s no holds barred, never say die, you know, no compromise position. WAYNE LaPIERRE: Our children— we as a society leave them every day utterly defenseless, and the monsters and the predators of the world know it and exploit it. NARRATOR: In Washington, they said the speech was a political disaster. PROTESTER: The NRA stop killing our children! NARRATOR: In New York City, LaPierre was called the craziest man on earth and a gun nut. But those who know LaPierre say the speech was no miscalculation. PAUL BARRETT: This was not off the cuff. He didn’t lose it. This was very thought out. And they decided on a strategy and they executed the strategy. JOHN AQUILINO: Because the people that it resonated with gave more money, and this is what you need to do in order to keep that— that tough persona. PAUL BARRETT: And we’ve got to send the signal that this is not the time to compromise, that Obama is the enemy, and they want to take your guns away. Yes, it’s too bad about the kids, but we are not going to back down. And that was that. (The documentary is well worth watching in full if you are unfamiliar with LaPierre's history with NRA and the dramatic influence this one man has had on our country.) Would sensible gun control put an end to violence?  Of course not. Will it stop all murder and suicide? Obviously not. But we are experiencing an epidemic of gun violence in this country the likes of which no one else in the world has to live with. And the way to deal with that is by treating it as an epidemic. There is a famous story about a British doctor by the name of John Snow who had a theory that cholera was spread through water contaminated by sewage. In the 1850s, it was widely assumed that the disease was caused by breathing vapors or a “miasma in the atmosphere” and Snow was unable to convince his colleagues otherwise. In 1854 there was a bad outbreak in the London suburb of Soho, where Snow happened to live. He suspected that the outbreak was due to a very busy public water pump in the center of town and set about tracking it meticulously through hospital records and interviews. By creating a geographical grid to chart of deaths, connecting them to the pump and eliminating other possible sources, Dr Snow was able to create what he considered proof that the drinking water was causing the outbreak. He took the evidence to the town officials and convinced them to take the handle off the pump. The epidemic ceased almost immediately. It was years before the medical profession fully understood the bacteriological basis for the disease and develop treatments for it. But the point is that it wasn't necessary to cure the disease to end the epidemic. What ended it was shutting down that pump. What Clinton said in her statement yesterday is indisputably true. We have all the epidemiological evidence we need to know that gun control will save lives. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, after DC banned handguns, gun homicides fell by 25 percent and gun suicides fell by 23 percent. Even more dramatically, after Australia banned automatic, semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns and initiated a buyback program to take 700,000 guns out of private hands after a horrific mass shooting nearly 20 years ago, they have not had a single mass shooting since. Gun homicides fell by 59 per cent and firearm-related suicides fell by 65 per cent with no consequential rise in homicides and suicides by other means. They didn't cure violence or hatred or depression or death.  They just shut down the pump. We could too. It's really not that complicated.

          / CBS News A lecture on video game culture was canceled at Utah State University this week after the school received threats of a mass shooting. Controversy that started online has now moved to the real world, reports CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan. ""Women are often a damsel in distress or helpless in some way, or they're highly sexualized and created to be these male fantasies,"" media critic Anita Sarkeesian said. In her video blog, Sarkeesian speaks out about the way women are unfairly portrayed in video games. She planned to speak on this topic at Utah State University before the school received an anonymous letter, threatening a massacre. The letter read, ""I have at my disposal a semi-automatic rifle, multiple pistols, and a collection of pipe bombs. This will be the deadliest school shooting in American history."" Sarkeesian was told Utah law prevented campus police from stopping people with guns from entering the speech, so she canceled her appearance. This is the latest development in what has become known as ""gamergate"" -- an online culture war. On one side are mostly female critics and their supporters, asking for more diverse representation of women in video games.  On the other, traditionalist gamers who oppose to major changes, voicing their criticism in online forums. ""Gamergate is what I call a sexist temper tantrum,"" she said. ""It is a group of mostly men, male gamers, who are attacking women."" So-called gamergaters harass their critics in online posts using language too graphic to repeat. Another target of gamergate is video game developer Brianna Wu, who received online death threats and was forced to leave her house. ""So I think you have a culture of an industry that's been told from the top down for so long that this is a space for boys and men,"" Wu said. The U.S. gaming industry brought in nearly $13 billion in revenue last year, $2 billion dollars more than Hollywood box office totals. The entertainment software association reports that women make up 48% percent of the gaming community. Sarkeesian and Wu hope that presence will force a change in the direction of the industry. ""Women who are asking for more diversity and more inclusivity in games are being attacked in really vicious ways,"" Sarkeesian said. ""It's almost like they're afraid we're going to take their toys away."" Gamergaters argue that their first amendment rights are being challenged by Sarkesian and her peers, and that even if some don't share their taste in video games, they have the right to make and play them.

NEWS BRIEF Police in Florida arrested a man Wednesday in connection with setting fire to the mosque where Omar Mateen, the gunman in the Pulse nightclub massacre, had worshipped. The St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Department said officers were interrogating Joseph Michael Schreiber, a 32-year-old who lives near the mosque, and who has written anti-Muslim Facebook posts. Officers said they received tips from the community connecting Schreiber to the fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, and that surveillance footage captured a man approaching the mosque on a motorcycle with a bottle of liquid and some papers, then leaving after a sudden flash. Schreiber faces arson charges, which when coupled with a hate-crime charge, could be a first-degree felony that carries a sentence of up to 30 years. The fire to the church was set around midnight Sunday, the 15th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in New York, which corresponded with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha. Investigators searched Schreiber’s home for evidence, and culled information from social media that would support a hate crime charge. According to the Associated Press, one post Schreiber made in July read: ""IF AMERICA truly wants peace and safety and pursuit of happiness they should consider all forms of ISLAM as radical. ... ALL ISLAM IS RADICAL, and should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS (sic) and all hoo (sic) participate in such activity should be found guilty of WAR CRIM (sic) until law and order is restored in this beautiful free country."" Since the shooting at the Pulse nightclub that killed 49 people—the worst mass shooting in U.S. history—the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce has received numerous threats. The mosque has increased security, but that has not stopped its congregants from being harassed. One Muslim man was beaten up in the parking lot. On another day, a group of motorcyclists circled the mosque and threatened people as they left. The Council of American-Islam Relations (CAIR) has said nationwide attacks against Muslims and mosques has increased. The organization said this year is on pace to beat the record-high number of attacks and incidents of harassment and intimidation set in 2015. CAIR has even begun offering rewards for tips to police in any case where Muslims may have been targeted because of their religion.

99,http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-sweden-grenades-idUKKCN0QE09F20150809,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Alistair Scrutton, Elias von Hildebrand 6 Min Read MALMO, Sweden (Reuters) - After years in the military and police dealing with bombs and mines in ex-Yugoslavia, Lebanon and Iraq, Goran Mansson is now back home advising Swedes what to do if they find an unexploded grenade on their street or in a playground. As bomb squad chief in the western port city of Malmo, Mansson has been busy with a dozen grenade attacks in the last few months. They have shocked a Nordic country that prides itself on safety, led to worries criminality is out of control and given political fodder to a resurgent far-right that blames immigrant gangs for the violence. “It is strange to be doing almost the same in Malmo that I was doing in Iraq,” Mansson said at his headquarters where unexploded grenades - manufactured in ex-Yugoslavia - were neatly lined up on his desk. The attacks, as well as other bombs placed in cars and parks, have wounded two people this year but not killed anyone. The pattern of targets – from flats to offices and one building housing a Ramadan celebration – appears random. No one has been arrested. The best guess, experts say, is a gang turf war that could easily see fatalities as tit-for-tat attacks spiral. Iraqi-born Ghanem Almanei described the attack on the Ramadan celebration, attended by some 50 people. “It was a really big bomb. It was women, girls inside.” said Almanei, his voice shaking, half-an-hour after men on motor bikes threw a grenade against the building. “I don’t feel safe now in this country.” These incidents have focussed attention on gang-related violence in one of Sweden’s most segregated cities where unemployment rates top 40 percent in some deprived, mainly immigrant areas. The bomb and grenade attacks – in six months already near the total level of 2014 - came the same year as a mass shooting in the nearby city of Gothenburg. Two masked men opened fire in a bar, killing two and wounding at least 10 people. “These attacks are creating terror and it plays into the hand of the far right” said Joakim Palmkvist, a Swedish journalist and author of Mafia War. “The general effect is scaring the public to an extent that has been unknown before.” While most Swedes are open to immigrants, the far right Sweden Democrats became the third biggest party in parliament in last year’s election, in part by demanding a clampdown on immigration and crime. “This (wave of grenade attacks) is because we have segregation in Sweden and most of it is in Malmo,” said Jorgen Grubb, Sweden Democrats chairman in Malmo. “It’s always people from other countries that do these things. What Malmo needs is to put up a red stop sign.” But the city’s most infamous killer was Swedish-born - Peter Mangs was arrested in 2010 for three murders and 13 attempted murders over a seven-year period, a string of shootings in Malmo targeting immigrants. With a population of just 300,000, Malmo has long been a smuggling hub due its closeness to Denmark, with which it has been connected by a bridge to Copenhagen since 2000. Around a third of the city’s population are immigrants - double the national average, and nearly one in three is unemployed. Among young immigrants, the rate is nearly 40 percent - Somalis, Iraqis, Bosnians and Iranians squeezed into concrete tenement blocks. Gangs began here decades ago as motorcycle groups and were increasingly dominated by immigrants, thanks to an influx in the 1990s of refugees of Balkan wars and then immigrants from the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe. It is this mixture of poverty, joblessness and immigrants that has given Malmo a reputation as Sweden’s roughest city – what some newspapers have called Sweden’s “Chicago”. Most grenades have been smuggled from the Balkans to Malmo, a gateway to the rest of Scandinavia for drugs and arms. The leader of one main gang is said to be a Serbian who came to Sweden as a refugee in the 1990s. Palmkvist says grenades can be bought in the black market for a little as 70 dollars each. “Terror is not just about a lone gunman,” author Palmkvist said, referring to attacks by a 22-year-old man on a synagogue and free speech event in Copenhagen - a short car ride across a bridge from Malmo - that killed two people in February. “Terror is also about a lot grenades being thrown.” The city’s main mosque has suffered several arson attacks. Jewish groups have warned of growing anti-Semitic attacks. Two schools were closed this year due to violence among students. With its street cafes and gentrifying old port, Malmo still seems a picture of Swedish prosperity. In the poorest districts, carefully tended gardens and children’s parks compare favourably with some of Europe’s inner cities. But that has not stopped a sense of fear in the city. “I feel very concerned. I have a daughter who is growing up here,” said Kristin Lidgren, who works with a theatre group. “The danger is young people take this way of criminal life as normal.” With no arrests after the recent attacks, local media have criticised police for being undermanned as officers head to the beach, underscoring what some argue is complacency and resignation on the part of the authorities. “It’s the summer and many police are on holidays.” said Palmkvist. “Welcome to Sweden.” Added reporting by Mikael Nilsson; Editing by Janet McBride Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Police at an Occupy protest in Oakland in 2012Glenn Halog/Flickr  With the Republican National Convention imminent, the Cleveland Police Department is finalizing its security plan for what is expected to be a volatile few days. The city announced last Friday that it was updating its plan following last week’s mass shooting of police officers in Dallas, and though it shared scant detail, the Cleveland PD is set to be outfitted with plenty of heavy gear. The RNC is designated as a National Special Security Event by the US Department of Homeland Security, which entitled Cleveland to a $50 million federal grant toward its security plan. According to bids the city has posted to its website and reports from local news outlets, so far Cleveland has spent the money on: Other supplies include bulletproof helmets, pepper spray, two-point slings (used to carry rifles) and inmate mattresses. The Cleveland PD also asked the Chicago Police Department to loan it three bearcats, and Taser International is loaning the department 300 body cameras that can be attached to riot suits. The city also put out a bid for tear gas, according to the Washington Post, and it recently upped its protest insurance coverage from $9.5 million to $50 million. This approach by the city isn’t unusual, per se; Tampa, Florida, bought similar kinds of equipment (though less of it) ahead of the RNC there in 2012. But Cleveland is the first city to host a political convention with its police department under a consent decree with the federal government. The Cleveland PD has been under the oversight of a federal monitoring team charged with enforcing the decree since October 2015, because of a history of excessive force and other abuses. Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department lawyer who supervised the agency’s Cleveland PD investigation, told the Marshall Project, “You would want a department [to provide security] that has systems that are in place where there is better accountability and better supervision.” In a report issued in June, the team monitoring the Cleveland PD under the decree characterized the police department’s ability to investigate officer misconduct as “dire.” Cleveland’s consent decree calls for changes to the department’s use-of-force policy and internal-review protocol, but those changes are still in progress. Jocelyn Rosnick, an attorney with the National Lawyers Guild’s Cleveland office, told Mother Jones that the group has concerns about the equipment and tactics that the Cleveland PD plans to deploy. The police department’s purchase of 10,000 flexible handcuffs, she said, indicates “they are preparing for mass arrests.” She also cautions about potential escalation: Earlier this year, a coalition of international civil liberties groups released a report on the health impacts of crowd-control weapons commonly used by law enforcement. The report focused on how projectile weapons such as rubber bullets or beanbags can cause severe injuries, including ruptured organs and even death. The report also found that chemical weapons like tear gas and pepper spray can cause permanent disabilities such as blindness and respiratory problems. Rosnick also notes that wearing riot gear is a display of force that could chill people’s First Amendment right to protest. (Cleveland officials have said officers will only wear riot gear if it becomes necessary.) And she wonders whether the Cleveland PD has sufficient training or will show adequate restraint. “The police department that was found to use excessive force a couple months ago,” she said, “is still the department we have today.” Jane Castor, who was chief of the Tampa Police Department when that city hosted the RNC in 2012, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the Tampa PD’s approach to security—which included officers working in standard uniforms, passing out food and water to protesters, and arresting people only as a last resort—resulted in just two convention-related arrests and zero lawsuits from protesters after the convention. Cleveland is expected to see many more protesters than Tampa did, however. Militarization of police departments has returned to the spotlight since the country erupted with protests last week following two high-profile fatal shootings by cops. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police officers used tear gas, pepper spray, and a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) to disperse protesters during demonstrations over the police shooting death of Alton Sterling. And officers in St. Paul, Minnesota, used smoke bombs to disperse a crowd that had blocked a highway. Watchdogs are working to prepare protesters for what may come. Matthew Barge, the attorney appointed to lead the federal oversight effort, told the Marshall Project that the public could report instances of police abuse at the RNC on the monitoring team’s website. “We are not going to be bashful about reviewing what happens at the RNC,” he said.

102,http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/05/shocking-study-criminals-generally-dont-buy-guns-legally-at-gun-shops/,"Every time there is a mass shooting or any other criminal event involving guns there is a chorus of voices imploring us to think about the children and pass new background check laws or other restrictions on the purchase of firearms. It’s a touching story and one which gets the media all up in high dudgeon as they beseech us to help stop the violence. So how much of an impact will these laws have in terms of keeping the guns out of the hands of the bad guys? Yet another study (which will doubtless receive no attention in the mainstream media) has given us a fairly good idea of the answer to that question. Criminals aren’t buying their guns at Walmart, folks. (NRA-ILA) Numerous studies conducted by academic researchers and by the federal government have shown that criminals do not use legal markets to obtain guns. And now we have more evidence of this reality, this time looking at criminals in Chicago. Philip J. Cook, Susan T. Parker, and Harold A. Pollack conducted interviews with criminals being held in the Cook County Jail. Their primary findings were that criminals get guns from their “social network,” i.e. friends and persons known to them, but generally not from the various legal sources available to them. They do not buy guns in gun stores. They do not get guns at gun shows. They do not buy them from Internet sources. The study even found that criminals only rarely steal guns. The basic mechanics of this study are of interest because of the source material used. Let’s say you want to know where criminals are getting the guns they use in their crimes. I suppose you could do a national survey and ask people what they think. Or you could call in Michael Bloomberg or one of the other leaders of various gun grabbing groups and get them to opine. But these studies took a different approach: they went into the jails and prisons and asked the actual prisoners themselves. What a refreshing idea. The results shouldn’t be all that shocking to anyone who has thought about it in an honest fashion for more than a few minutes. Lots of criminals who are playing the game at a level that will involve shooting people already have extensive records and wouldn’t pass even the most cursory background check if they tried to purchase a gun legally. (And contrary to popular liberal belief, there are virtually no legal gun sales taking place which don’t require a background check aside from family or estate purchases.) And even if a would be criminal has a clean enough record to buy one, the study reveals that most of them fear purchasing a gun legally because they know it could be quickly traced back to them. There are probably a few stupid criminals out there who don’t realize this, but thankfully the stupid criminals are generally the easiest ones to find. Instead, the people we should actually be trying to stop are buying their guns on the black market. They get them from friends and criminal associates. Most of those interviewed even distrusted so called internet sales on guns because they feared they were sting operations and they’d wind up trying to buy one from an ATF agent. In other words, passing more laws to hamper the sales of guns through normal, legal means is only going to impede people who tend to follow the law in the first place. I know… I know… knock you over with a feather. Strangely, the closing footnotes of the linked study still seem to wind up at the wrong destination after producing so much good work. They concluded that since criminals do not hold guns long, “disrupting” the supply chain would have a positive effect on criminal gun use. That seems like a safe conclusion driven more by common sense than any evidence from an expensive academic study. But how this “disruption” can be achieved is not spelled out or suggested. I absolutely agree that “disrupting the supply chain” of guns passing into the hands of criminals is a wonderful idea. Of course, you’re not going to do that by closing down gun shops or shutting down gun shows or putting more restrictions on legal sales to law abiding citizens. You could, however, enforce our existing laws and aggressively channel the necessary resources into law enforcement to root out and eliminate the suppliers who are selling black market weapons to drug dealers and killers. But I suppose that makes too much sense to bother with, eh? Copyright ©2021 HotAir.com/Salem Media.

104,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/eBLCxkPieCc/,"On September 2, Breitbart News reported on Spike’s Tactical’s Crusader Rifle — a rifle etched with a Bible verse and a cross in hopes of keeping Muslim terrorists from handling or using the weapon. On September 3, the Huffington Post reported that the Florida chapter of the Council for American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) described the rifle as “shameful marketing ploy” that would only stir “hatred, division, [and] violence.” CAIR also claimed that have been “250 mass shootings” in American in 2015 alone, only one of which they credit to a Muslim gunman. There haven’t been 250 mass shootings this year. In fact, a recent study by the University of Alabama’s Mark Lankford shows there were only 90 mass shootings throughout the entire 46 years spanning 1966 to 2012. And the Congressional Research Service (CRS) released a July 30 CRS study showing America averaged “4.4 mass public shootings” a year between the years 1999 and 2013 — a figure that was elevated because of a higher number of attacks in 2012. But those claiming a mass shooting a day are not really concerned about facts. Rather, they are concerned with making a point. In this case, CAIR is concerned with having an elevated number of mass shootings so the number of shootings that involved a Muslim gunman can be represented as a smaller fraction of the overall figure. And quoting such a figure helps them distract from the key issue, which is the Crusader rifle. The words of Psalm 144:1 — ”Blessed be the Lord my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle” — are etched upon the right side of the rifle’s lower, while a cross and shield are etched upon the left side. And along the AR-15’s safety lever are the Latin words “Pax Pacis” (Peace), “Bellum” (War), and “Deus Vult” (God Wills It). Peace is the gun’s safe position while “War” is the gun’s fire position. WTSP 10 News quoted Spike’s Tactical spokesman Ben “Mookie” Thomas explaining why the company decided to create the Crusader: Right now and as it has been for quite some time, one of the biggest threats in the world is and remains Islamic terrorism. We wanted to make sure we built a weapon that would never be able to be used by Muslim terrorists to kill innocent people or advance their radical agenda. CAIR’s response: “This is just another shameful marketing ploy intended to profit from the promotion of hatred, division and violence.” It should be noted that CAIR filed a suit against Florida Gun Supply after that store’s owner, Andy Hallinan, announced that his store would be a “Muslim free zone” following Muslim immigrant Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez’s July 16 terrorist attack on U.S. military personnel in Chattanooga. CAIR responded to Hallinan’s decision by saying: “Such discrimination is not only illegal, it is bad for our country and makes us less safe and less free.” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

For those keeping track, that's an average of more than one shooting per day. These numbers are according to the Mass Shooting Tracker created by the anti-gun subreddit Guns Are Cool. Wednesday morning's stunning on-air fatal shooting in Roanoke, Virginia of a television reporter and a photographer wasn't even the first shooting of the day. Roughly three hours earlier at 3:15 a.m., four people were shot during a home invasion in Minneapolis. It is important to note that the Mass Shooting Tracker defines a mass shooting as a shooting spree in which four or more people are shot. The folks at Guns Are Cool notes that this differs from the FBI definition in which an event only qualifies as a mass shooting if four or more people are killed. ""The most obscene incidents of gun violence usually do not make the mainstream news at all,"" Guns Are Cool writes on the reddit page for the Mass Shooting Tracker. ""Why? Because their definition is incorrect. The mainstream news meaning of ""mass shooting"" should more accurately be described as ""mass murder.'"" Earlier today, democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for action after the shooting in Virginia. ""We have got to do something about gun violence in America,"" she told reporters at a press conference in Iowa. ""And I will take it on."" ""There's so much evidence that if guns were not so readily available, if there were universal background checks ... that maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage,"" she added Hours after the shooting took place, Clinton also issued this tweet:   Here's a map that shows firearm deaths in America:

That is about 1.95 “public mass shootings” a year. According to Mother Jones, University of Alabama associate professor Adam Lankford’s study was an examination of the years 1966 to 2012. He found a total of “90 public mass shootings” in America during that time frame. His criteria for a “public mass shootings” uses the standard threshold of four deaths in an incident, which is the same criteria used by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) for studies carried out for Congress. Using this approach, Lankford found an average of approximately 1.95 “public mass shootings” per year. This aligns closely with what the CRS found when they determined there had been less than four and a half “mass public shootings” a year in the U.S. during the smaller time frame of 1999-2013. On the other hand, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria said a claim of 207 mass shootings in the first 207 days of 2015 was “almost literally true” based on reports from Shooting Tracker, an online source that keeps a running tally of mass public shootings but does not require a single fatality in order to categorize an event as a mass shooting. Instead, Shooting Tracker says, “A mass shooting is when four or more people are shot in an event, or related series of events, likely without a cooling off period.” This means an incident where four people are injured is a mass shooting just like the incident in which 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary.

          / CBS News Whenever there is a mass shooting in the United States, it doesn't take long before pundits suggests violent video games might be to blame. But a new report from the American Psychological Association (APA) found there is insufficient research to support that link. It found that there is evidence showing the games increase aggression but not enough to demonstrate that playing the games lead to criminal behavior or delinquency. ""Scientists have investigated the use of violent video games for more than two decades but to date, there is very limited research addressing whether violent video games cause people to commit acts of criminal violence,"" said Mark Appelbaum, the task force chair. ""However, the link between violence in video games and increased aggression in players is one of the most studied and best established in the field."" In reviewing more than 150 research papers, the task force found a consistent relationship between the games and an increase in ""aggressive behavior"" as well as a decrease in ""prosocial behavior, empathy, and sensitivity to aggression"" and that this behavior continued for some time. But the task force also found that the video games alone can't explain this aggression. Rather, it concluded that the ""accumulation of risk factors,"" such as antisocial behavior, depression, trouble at home, delinquency or academic problems, also played a role. ""The research reviewed here demonstrates that violent video game use is one such risk factor,"" the report concluded. The findings are unlikely to put to rest the concerns about violent video games, especially given that over 90 percent of children play video games, with 85 percent of those games containing some violence. The games came under fire in 2012 after Adam Lanza gunned down 20 children and six teachers Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. It later turned out that he was obsessed with violent video games, prompting calls from some members of Congress for restrictions on them. Ohio State University's Brad J. Bushman, who has done extensive work on violent media including games and aggression, said he disagreed with the APA conclusion that there is no link between violent video games and violent behavior, although he acknowledged it is difficult to prove a link in an experimental setting. ""One can never know for sure whether playing violent video games causes violent criminal behavior, because it is unethical for researchers to allow participants to engage in violent criminal behavior in their laboratory experiments,"" Bushman told CBS News. ""However, there certainly is a link between playing violent video games and violent criminal behavior, although it is not as strong as the link between playing violent video games and less serious aggressive behavior."" In one experiment in which he took part, adolescent boys were given the opportunity to blast an ostensible opponent with loud noise through headphones after being randomly assigned to play a violent or nonviolent video game. The results showed that boys who played a violent game and strongly identified with the violent game character selected noise levels loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage to their partner. But other studies have found no link, including one from the University of Missouri in April that found violent video games did not cause gamers with Autism Spectrum Disorder - something Lanza is believed to have suffered - to act violently. Another 2013 study found that violent video games such as ""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Halo,"" and ""Grand Theft Auto"" did not trigger violence in teenagers with symptoms of depression or attentions deficit disorder. The Entertainment Software Association, which represents the U.S. video game industry, criticized the APA study, noting that youth violence has declined to a 40-year low during the ""video game epoch."" ""Considering the APA's long-standing bias against and attacks on video games, this slanted report is not surprising,"" the group said in a statement. ""Numerous medical professionals, researchers, and courts all debunk the fundamental thesis of their argument. In tearing down similar faulty research, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically ruled that 'psychological studies purporting to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively.' We could not state it better."" The APA task force acknowledged that more research is needed on the issue, including studies that looked at the impact of violent video games on gamers younger than 10, potential gender differences in the response of gamers as well as the effects on different ethnic groups. But even with the limited evidence of criminal behavior, the APA is calling on the gaming industry to design video games that include increased parental control over the amount of violence the games contain. The APA's Council of Representatives, earlier this month, also adopted a resolution encouraging the Entertainment Software Rating Board to refine its video game rating system ""to reflect the levels and characteristics of violence in games, in addition to the current global ratings"" and for developers to design games that are appropriate to users' age and psychological development.

University of Brighton provides funding as a member of The Conversation UK. The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list The murder of two journalists in Virginia, live on TV, by a disgruntled co-worker who later shot himself, has once again sparked debates about gun legislation in the US, with the White House calling for action by Congress. The tragedy happened a few days after an American researcher in criminal justice, Adam Lankford, released results of a global study of incidents involving 292 mass killers between 1966 and 2012. By way of definition, the murders in Virginia would not actually have made the survey as there were three victims – including the perpetrator himself – and the FBI determines a killing to be “mass” when it involves four or more deaths. While the US is not the only country to experience the problem of mass shootings – Lankford’s data came from 171 countries – it is certainly way out in the lead with 90 incidents. Only four other countries made it into double figures, as the graph below shows. Britain has had three – Hungerford in 1987, Dunblane in 1996 and Cumbria in 2010. The US does not even have the most murderous mass shooting, that dubious distinction goes to Norway where Anders Breivik gunned down 69 young people at a summer camp outside Oslo in 2011. Despite the global manifestation of mass shootings, they are frequently seen as a distinctly American phenomenon. The flipside of the American Dream, as it were, is the gun crazy nightmare and the instant “dark celebrity” that running amok with a firearm can achieve. And to understand that, argues Lankford, we have to understand the American gun culture, and the values that surround it. America certainly leads the world in terms of its rate of gun ownership with almost 90 guns for every 100 people. The proportion of gun owners in the USA is falling, now around 35% – except among Republican leaning voters. Gun owners now tend to own more guns than they used to, choosing to augment their personal firepower as newer guns (military specification semi-automatic pistols and assault rifles) become available. The values and lifestyle appealed to in firearms advertising evoke confidence, masculinity, empowerment and responsibility; a 2012 advertisement equated gun ownership with getting your “man card” back. Globally, gun ownership is still a male preserve and the Geneva based Small Arms Survey project estimates that 96% of guns owners in the world are men. If anything, the US is slightly more equal, with 12% of women claiming to be gun owners. Revealingly, Lankford’s survey finds only one mass killing perpetrated by a woman – the 2006 murder of six postal workers in California by Jennifer San Marco. Some research suggests that shooters specifically target women and girls as a form of violent abusive entitlement. Clearly, as Lankford points out in his research, the risk of mass shootings is more likely in a society in which the private ownership of firearms is common as opposed to one where it is relatively rare. But rare events are incredibly difficult to predict. A particular kind of competitive individualistic culture may produce large numbers of embittered loners and losers bearing grudges and seeking revenge against former schools, employers, girlfriends, bullying classmates – all of which feature prominently in the diaries and social media epitaphs of perpetrators. But if these individuals can’t access firearms, they can’t undertake their outrages. The real breakthrough in understanding came when better global data began to be produced of the relations between rates of gun ownership and gun violence from the late 1990s onwards. Before then, the US was the only real source of such data, although research into the impact of guns in the US has continued to be blocked by the gun lobby. More recent evidence shows a much clearer connection between rates of gun ownership and rates of gun homicide. Lankford’s study comes to a similar conclusion: Firearm ownership rates appeared to be a statistically significant predictor of the distribution of public mass shooters worldwide. But the numbers are not the whole story: culture is important. There are relatively controlled “gun cultures” as well as decontrolled and dangerous ones, where you can legally purchase a lethal weapon from a total stranger in a car park, well below the radar of the authorities. Some 40% of US gun sales are thought to be “off the books” in this fashion. It also matters what kinds of guns you have in your possession.  Commentators have been noting that US rampage killings have lately become more frequent and more murderous, pointing to the contribution of assault rifles and large magazine capacity semi-automatics, which are now fairly widespread in civilian ownership. The timeline below shows mass shootings with more than 12 victims between 1945 and 2013. But if mass shootings are not uniquely American in many respects, American rampage killing is distinctive in one important respect. In my own recent work, I’ve examined how mass shootings have often served as the catalyst for a society to finally grasp the nettle of gun control and bring sweeping changes to its gun laws: except in America. There is something even more uncomfortable about this too. A mass shooting, especially of children, can galvanise opinion into action much more than other types of violence. So 20, five-year-old white children, killed in a school in a single day can mobilise opinion more than the fact of many more African American kids being killed every month. The real “American exceptionalism” is not that it has had so many mass shootings, but rather that it has done so little about them. Global Challenges Podcast Series 2

26 August 2015  A strange paradox is emerging in America: Overall violent-crime rates are down, but active shooter events — in which a person is trying to kill multiple people in a populated area — appear to be on the rise, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics. Meanwhile, a just-released study finds that although the United States has just about 5 percent of the world's population, the country has 31 percent of the world's mass shooters. The reasons for these numbers are complex, researchers say, but the data suggest that the availability of guns, and perhaps the American obsession with fame, may be to blame. The United States has more private gun ownership and more desire for fame than any other country in the world, said Adam Lankford, a criminal justice professor at the University of Alabama and author of the new research, presented Sunday (Aug. 23) at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association. [5 Milestones in Gun Control History] The possible association between mass shootings and a desire for fame is particularly eerie, given the nation's latest high-profile killing. Early this morning (Aug. 26), a former employee at a local news station in Virginia allegedly killed a reporter and a cameraman on-air, while filming the shooting with a GoPro camera. He later posted the film to social media. Because there were fewer than four victims, the event does not qualify as a mass shooting, according to most definitions. But the apparent desire to broadcast the crime places the killer in the same company as many notorious mass shooters of the past decade. [The History of Human Aggression] ""Especially some of the younger ones — they want attention,"" said Mary Muscari, a forensic nurse at Binghamton University in New York who has studied revenge-driven mass killers. ""That's why you see them wanting to have a bigger head count, a bigger body count, to try to outdo the last one or to do something that is going to cause more of a rise."" A person claiming to be the alleged gunman in the Virginia attack sent a 23-page fax to ABC News after the shooting, claiming to be influenced by Seung-Hui Cho, the killer in the Virginia Tech shooting of 2007. ""He got NEARLY double the amount that Eric Harris and Dylann [sic] Klebold [the Columbine shooters] got,"" the writer of the fax added, according to ABC News. The fax also claimed that the shooting was in response to the mass killing at a Charleston church in June. The paradox of mass shootings There are no official definitions of a mass shooting, and varying ways of tracking the data — by fatalities, by total victims — can make finding trends in this type of violence difficult. A person who arms himself with enough ammo to take out dozens but who only manages to kill one or two people would not be included in federal statistics that track crimes with four or more victims. The term ""mass shooting"" also encompasses a range of crimes with a variety of motivations. A gang drive-by that kills multiple people would count, though the root cause is very different from the kind of rampage killings that occur regularly in schools, churches and theaters around the country. The FBI attempted to narrow the definition in a 2014 report that focused on ""active shooter"" situations, defined as shootings in which an individual tried to kill people in a public place, and excluding gang- or drug-related violence. The agency found that 160 active-shooter incidents had occurred between 2000 and 2013, and that the number of events was rising. In the first seven years of the period, the average number of active-shooter incidents per year was 6.4. In the final seven years, the annual average rose to 16.4. In these 160 shootings, 486 people were killed and 557 were wounded, not including the shooters. The rise in active-shooter events bucks the general trend toward less violent crime in the United States: Overall violent crime dropped 14.5 percent between 2004 and 2013, according to the FBI. This disconnect echoes what Lankford found in his latest research. Lankford analyzed mass-shooting events in which four or more people were killed in 171 countries, between 1966 and 2012. He found that the rate of mass shootings did not correlate with the overall homicide rate. ""Being a dangerous country or a so-called peaceful country was not a predictor"" of mass shootings, Lankford told Live Science. The link to guns What did predict the number of mass shootings, however, was the prevalence of firearm ownership, Lankford found. Countries with higher firearm ownership rates had more public mass shootings. [Private Gun Ownership in the US (Infographic)] ""That wasn't a shocking finding, but I guess what surprised me was it showed up no matter how many or what type of statistical tests I ran,"" Lankford said. ""It was kind of unshakable."" The link between firearm ownership and mass shootings remained even when the United States was removed from the analysis, Lankford said. For example, Switzerland and Finland, two relatively low-crime countries with high rates of personal gun ownership, had more mass shootings than would otherwise be expected. Studies within the United States have also found links between gun ownership and gun crime. Research published in July found that states with more gun-owning households had higher rates of firearm assault, robbery, homicide and overall homicide compared with states with fewer gun owners. Lankford also found that mass shootings in the United States tended to take place at schools, businesses or workplaces, whereas international mass shootings were most common at military installations. ""Looking back, it maybe makes sense, because that's where people have the easiest access to firearms in other countries,"" he said. Discussions of firearm access usually lead to arguments about gun-control laws. But there may be another way, said Michael Siegel, a physician at the Boston University School of Public Health who researches gun violence. Like smoking-related diseases, gun deaths are a public health problem, Siegel told Live Science. And like cigarettes, guns could be susceptible to the same sort of cultural change that has banished smokers to outdoor alcoves and sent smoking rates plummeting. ""There may be ways that we can actually intervene and try to change the gun culture itself,"" Siegel said. Attitudes toward guns have already shifted, he said. There was a time when guns were thought of primarily as tools for hunting and recreation. Increasingly, however, the conversation has shifted to gun use for defense, to ""stand your ground"" laws and to the right to carry guns openly in public. ""That's a change in social norms that has occurred,"" Siegel said. Public health campaigns could seek to push back, encouraging people to think of guns as recreational, not as something meant to be used against one another, he said. Becoming infamous Gun ownership can't be the entire story, though, given that overall violent crime is decreasing. There seems to be something that sets mass shootings apart. One possibility is the American preoccupation with fame. Studies have found that Americans are more interested in fame than people of other nationalities are. A 2007 Pew Research survey of 18- to 25-year-olds found that about half said that getting famous was a top priority for their peers. Television shows increasingly promote fame as a value, research has found, and pop lyrics are becoming more narcissistic. A 2010 review of research studies found that modern college students display less empathy than students of the late 1970s. These studies fit a general pattern of research showing that narcissism is on the rise. Simultaneously, Lankford said, the line between being famous and infamous is blurring. Scientists looked at the covers of People magazine issues dating from 1974 to 1998, and found that cover stars were increasingly featured for bad behavior — cheating, arrests, crime — rather than good acts (though there was a slight shift toward positivity after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks), according to their 2005 report. Likewise, reality television and talk shows vault people into the limelight for bad behavior, Lankford said. ""There is a 'fame at any cost' mentality,"" he said. And many mass killers explicitly cite fame as their motivation: A quick Google search for ""wanted to top Columbine"" reveals multiple news articles about killers or would-be killers mentioning the 1999 school shooting as their inspiration. ""We know that a lot of public mass shooters, particularly when they're young, have admitted that they really want to be famous, and that killing is how they're going to do it,"" Lankford said. Of course, many mass shooters end up killing themselves or being killed by law enforcement before they see the publicity related to their crime. Some are suicidal and want to take others out with them, Muscari said. Others don't care or don't seem to comprehend what death will mean. ""We see, sometimes, with adolescents — they envision themselves committing suicide but actually seeing themselves at their funeral or wake,"" Muscari said. ""They don't connect 'dead' and 'being dead.'"" There also seems to be a copycat effect by mass shooters. In a study published in July, researchers reported that school shootings and mass shootings occur in clusters. On average, each school shooting inspires 0.22 other school shootings, and each mass shooting inspires 0.3 additional mass shootings. (The fractions simply represent that not every mass shooting will lead to another. For every five school shootings, the researchers said, one is inspired by a past school shooting.) Absent a sudden shift in gun policy, decreasing the notoriety of mass killers may be the best defense. Media reports should focus on the victims and not name the killers, Muscari said. ""Don't give them their fame,"" she said. Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on Live Science.

But in a car in the carbon monoxide-infused queue waiting to enter Detroit, their beings diverge drastically from mine. I am white. They are not. They are vulnerable. I am not. Here’s the thing: I like the guards at the American border. They’re always friendly with me, decent, even enjoyable company. At the booth in between the never-was of Windsor and the has-been of Detroit, the officer I happened to draw had a gruff belly and the mysterious air of intentional inscrutability, like a troll under a bridge in a fairytale. “Where are you headed?” he asked. “Burlington, Iowa.” “Why would anyone ever choose to go to Burlington, Iowa?” he asked philosophically. “I’m going to see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.” Then, because it did seem to require an explanation: “They’re giving rallies within a couple of days of each other.” “Why would anyone ever choose to go see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders?” I didn’t argue, because it was the border, but I could have said that the police chief of Birmingham estimated that 30,000 people showed up in Alabama to see Donald Trump in August and that in Dallas, he had filled the American Airlines Center, and that his counterpart, Bernie Sanders, has generated equally unprecedented numbers – vastly more than Barack Obama drew at comparable moments in the 2008 campaign. “I’m curious,” I said instead. At this point he asked me to roll down my window. But it was all fine. Like I said, I’m white. As I drove through the outskirts of the ruins of Detroit, across the I-94, one of the ugliest highways in the United States, the old familiar lightness fluttered to my heart. I love America. America is not my mother. Canada is my mother. But America is an unbelievably gorgeous, surprisingly sweet rich lady who lives next door and appears to be falling apart. I cannot help myself from loving it. For people who love to dwell in contradictions, the US is the greatest country in the world: the land of the free built on slavery, the country of law and order where everyone is entitled to a gun, a place of unimpeded progress where they cling to backwardness out of sheer stubbornness. And into this glorious morass, a new contradiction has recently announced itself: the white people, the privileged Americans, the ones who had the least to fear from the powers that be, the ones with the surest paths to brighter futures, the ones who are by every metric one of the most fortunate groups in the history of the world, were starting to die off in shocking numbers. The Case and Deaton report, Rising Morbidity and Mortality in Midlife among White Non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st Century, describes an increased death rate for middle-aged American whites “comparable to lives lost in the US Aids epidemic”. This spike in mortality is unique to white Americans – not to be found among other ethnic groups in the United States or any other white population in the developed world, a mysterious plague of despair. In one way, it was easy to account for all this white American death – “drug and alcohol poisoning, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis”, according to the report. It was not so easy to account for the accounting. Why were middle-aged white Americans drinking and drugging and shooting themselves to death? The explanations on offer were pre-prepared, fully plugged into confirmation bias: it was the economy or it was demography or it was godlessness or it was religion or it was the breakdown of the family or it was the persistence of antique values or it was the lack of social programs or it was the dependence on social programs. Case and Deaton call it “an epidemic of pain”. Fine. What does that mean? On the I-94, you do find yourself asking: what the fuck is wrong with these people? I mean, aside from the rapid decline of the middle class obviously. And the rise of precarious work and the fact that the basic way of life requires so much sedation that nearly a quarter of all Americans are on psychiatric drugs, and somewhere between 26.4 and 36 million Americans abuse opioids every day. Oh yes, and the mass shootings. There was more than one mass shooting a day. And the white terrorists targeting black churches again. And the regularly released videos showing the police assassinating black people. And the police in question never being indicted, let alone being sent to jail. And you know what Americans were worried about while all this shit was raining down on them? While all this insanity was wounding their beloved country? You know what their number one worry was, according to poll after poll after poll? Muslims. Muslims, if you can believe it. My body is white and it is male. It is six foot tall and weighs 190lb. It is 39 years old and it has had to start running. It has had to start counting calories. There is a tingle in the joint of my right thigh, so I try not to think about my body. The tingling comes and goes. I know my body is going to kill me. “A man who fears suffering already suffer what he fears,” as Montaigne said. That’s one of the reasons why men die so much younger than women – six years younger on average in America. Ninety-two percent of men say they wait at least a few days to see if they feel better before they go to a doctor, but I know what they mean by a few days. They mean a few more days than makes sense. It is hard to have a male and white body and to conceive of its weakness. In the same breath, my body cannot bring itself to believe it is the personification of power, though it evidently is in any rational accountancy of social status. It feels like a mere body. It feels mortal. I’ve never been to a place as white as Iowa. That’s the honest truth. Whenever I go to America it’s New York or Chicago or Los Angeles or Florida. In Burlington, at Jerry’s Main Lunch, the signature dish is “the hot mess, eggs and bacon cooked right into the hash browns. The sugar shakers all have white crackers in them, to prevent clumping – a classic bit of commonsense American know-how. The hot mess is delicious. Why don’t they make these everywhere? Why isn’t there a chain of Jerry’s Main Lunches serving hot messes all across the midwest? The answer is in the rest of the town: everything that’s going to leave has already left Burlington. The beautiful brick buildings downtown are mostly vacant. The most interesting street is the road out of town. The Memorial Arena, on the banks of the Mississippi, filled up early. Trump wasn’t speaking until 6pm but by 4.45 the parking situation was grim. Outside the building, the hawkers who follow Trump on the road, event to event, sold T-shirts and buttons, three for $10. “We shall overcomb.” “Cats for Trump, the time is Meow.” “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.” Inside, every seat had been taken and the floor filled quickly with a standing room only crowd. Burlington is 10% black. The rally was 99.99% white. The people who attend political rallies in America are a specific genre of humanity, like the people who stand outside in lines for nightclubs. They know where they’re supposed to go and how they’re supposed to behave when they get there. They have gear. An elderly lady sat beside me wearing a sequined stars-and-stripes-hat she clearly takes out for just these occasions. “Y’all from Illinois?” she asked. I’m not but I can pass. She goes to all the rallies, she explained. She’s been a Republican her whole life, an active Republican, an Iowa Republican. For 30 years, she’s been in crowds like this one. She plans to go, one time in her life, to the national convention. Like going to see the Stones. When the organizers passed around hand signs reading “The Silent Majority”, she grabbed a dozen so she could pass them around to others. Cheerful helpful women were half the crowd. Angry and absurd men were the other. They wore T-shirts with whole paragraphs written on them: “I am a United States Military Veteran. I once took a SOLEMN OATH to defend the CONSTITUTION against ALL enemies, foreign and Domestic. Be advised No one has ever relieved me of my duties under this Oath!” There were cars in the parking lot slathered with bumper stickers. “We the people are 100% FED UP!” “So if guns kills people, I guess pencils miss spell words [sic], cars drive drunk and spoons make people fat.” “I’m straight, conservative, Christian, and I own a gun. Is there anything else I can do to piss you off?” A picture of Obama with “Does this ass make my car look big?” The Republican style for 2016 is angry aphoristic humor. Behind comedy, absurd rage: America is the greatest country in the world but America is falling apart, government is the problem which is why government must solve it. This was a Trump production so naturally there was a VIP section. A door guarded by bald, unsmiling men, the bouncers who stand forever as the bored sentinels of indifferent celebrity. A swinging door at the side of the stage received and dispensed the best-looking people, the ones with the buffed neutrality of political professionals, the women whose faces have been tautened to a perma pout, the men who get their hair cut before every event. The woman beside me – Stars ’n’ Stripes Hat – was wearing a pewter elephant pendant. A young girl in a bright orange dress passed out of the VIP entrance wearing an elephant pendant encrusted with diamonds. Elephant pendants were a theme, I noticed, and elephant brooches and elephant rings and elephant T-shirts. They came in all different price points and in all different styles: round elephants reminiscent of French cartoons from the 1960s, and strange pseudo-sexual shimmies, and with 1920s straw boater hats leading parades. There was one kind of elephant you couldn’t find. An elephant that actually looked like an elephant. A realistic elephant might serve as a memento to the hundred elephants killed for their ivory every day. A naturalistic elephant would be inherently environmentalist. The elephants must all be fabulous. Like any good show, there was a warm-up act. In fact, there are two – three if you count the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. The first was Tana Goertz, an Iowa woman who had been runner-up on the third season of The Apprentice. “What a good-looking crowd,” she pandered. She vouched for Trump as a woman (“He loves women!”) and as someone who had returned to Iowa (“How could you live in New York City if you didn’t love people?”). She promoted the idea which is at the core of every last thing that Trump does, that simple contact with the man brings prosperity. “When you’re in the Trump train you’re going places!” She walked off to polite Iowan applause. The crowd would probably, all things considered, rather have listened to the Elton John music playing on the speakers instead, but at least she made the effort. A more standard hype man followed. Sam Clovis hosts a conservative radio show and is a Tea Party activist who has run and lost a bunch of Iowa Republican positions. He just started right in with it. Trump was “one of the greatest men to ever walk the face of this earth,” a good line – the crowd could have laughed but instead they applauded, thus proving that they were not paying attention or would swallow anything. Clovis compared Trump’s recent speeches to Reagan’s A Time for Choosing at the Goldwater convention in 1964, which must have been, to his way of thinking anyway, roughly like comparing it to the Sermon on the Mount. Clovis knew what the crowd had come to hear and he gave it to them. “America and Americans will be first again!” A collective roar shook the Burlington Memorial Arena. They so badly wanted to be first again. First in what was unclear but definitely first. After the roar died, the crowd was ready for Trump. But, showmanship. Trump let the tension build; the angry absurd men and the cheerful, helpful women hollered. Trump! Trump! Trump! I could barely imagine the pleasure the muted sound of his chanted name, from backstage, must have been bringing the man. When he finally took the stage, the crowd surged; their phones surged. It was an orgy of phones. The men behind Trump scanned the crowd with their phones. The cameras in the back were recording everyone recording each other. Trump was the only person not holding a screen, the absence that brought desire. He started roaring, as everybody in the crowd stopped to check the footage they had gathered. Trump started out with the clip he knew would appear on the news the next morning – Joe Biden had dropped out of the race and Trump approved of his decision because Biden never had a chance and Trump wanted to face Hillary. The mainstream media adroitly handled, Trump began his disquisition on the subject dearest to his heart: his own success. The Burlington rally marked the 100th day he had led the polls. He read the polls, poll after poll. He paused only to ask the crowd how great the polls were. “Beating Hillary nationwide do you love that?” The crowd approved of his approval numbers. And so he moved on to the more qualitative aspects of his greatness. His opponents just weren’t winners. “I speak from the brain but I also speak from the heart,” he said, rambling like a rich know-it-all uncle – “I’m bringing back the jobs from China!” – with brief digressions into self-pity: “Macy’s was very disloyal to me. They don’t sell my ties any more.” He described, in twists intermittently frank and self-deluded, the brilliance of his own capacity for political manipulation. He talked to the people he was spinning about how cleverly he was spinning them. So he declared “I’m a good Christian” and that if he became president “we’re going to be saying merry Christmas”, but then he couldn’t stop himself from acknowledging the cleverness of his Christian electioneering: “I walked on to a stage with a Bible, everybody likes me better.” Trump brought meta to Burlington, Iowa. And he did not deny the crowd that taste of celebrity they desired. What would he say to Caroline Kennedy, the ambassador to Japan? “You’re fired!” “You’re fired!” A few spectators started to drift out to beat the traffic and Trump shouted about the silent majority and about how he says what nobody else dares to say and about how he will end free trade and how Mexicans are car thieves (big laugh) and how he wants a piece of the action from the Keystone pipeline and how he’s going to help women’s health and how America used to be emulated. “The American Dream is dead but I’m going to make it bigger and stronger!” he shouted. At this moment he appeared to me the way every celebrity I have met in the flesh does, like a living pagan idol awaiting sacrifice, a puff-faced Baal. “We’re going to win so much,” he promised before leaving the stage to Twisted Sister’s We’re Not Going to Take It. I stayed to watch Trump work the line. Up close, in person, the hair is much more intricate than it appears on screen. Its construction is tripartite, its significance polyvalent. First and foremost, there is the comb-over, although it can be called a comb-over only in the sense that the mall in Dubai with a ski hill inside it can be called a building. It is hair as state-of-the-art engineering feat, with the diaphanous quality of a cloak out of Norse legend or some miraculous near-weightless metal developed in an advanced German laboratory. It floats over the skull, an act of defiance not only against ageing and loss but against time and space, against reality. Behind the technical display of the comb-over, as counterpoint, the back is as traditional and old-fashioned as a haircut can be. It’s a classic ducktail. It’s such a classic that I have only seen it in movies set in the 1950s. Not movies from the 1950s I should be clear, but movies from the 1970s about the 1950s. In between the comb-over and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly. It is the real part of the hair, the human part, the actual hair. It is the hinge of Donald Trump. As Trump’s campaign for the Republican nomination has unfolded, in all its unlikeliness, he has shaken hands with many thousands of Americans, and posed with many thousands for many thousands of selfies. And among those many thousands, not one has reached up to mess up his hair. Though he regularly brings up the physical appearances of his opponent, none of the other candidates even mention the fact that he looks ridiculous. Trump’s hair is an act of defiant social pre-emption: call me a phony. I dare you. I fucking dare you. A few hardcore fans lingered on the fringes, just like at a concert. Everybody else had drifted into the parking lot and the town center of Burlington was soon returned to its emptiness. A Trump show is good value for the money, especially since it’s free. They don’t even ask for donations. The morning after the rally, it has become clear that Iowa may be the bramble in Trump’s path. A scandal over an errant tweet has cloudburst. He blames the insult on a young intern. But the eight-point rise of Carson must be galling. Trump possesses the weakness of anyone who lives by the strength of their results. Results vary. When the results are down, where are you? Who are you? Trump is in the business of winning. Does Trump losing even exist? I had a day between Trump and Sanders, and all I had to read was a pdf of Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me, which I had agreed to look at for a book of the month club. After another hot mess at Jerry’s Main Lunch, and a run to burn it off, I spent a day at the Motel 8 in Burlington reading, while across the street, the Winegard factory, manufacturing satellite dishes 24 hours a day, thudded like a heart without syncopation. Did you know you can buy a six pack of beer and a bottle of bourbon for just a little over 20 bucks in Iowa? What a great country. The title of Between the World and Me comes from a Richard Wright poem called White Man, Listen! and it was never going to get much whiter or more male than me in the Motel 8 sipping bourbon and beer, on my iPhone, with the Jays and Royals highlights flickering in the background and the thud of the satellite dish factory in the background. The urgency of the book, the vitality of the historical imagination at play, rose like waves into crests of anger tumbling over their own force. It was all of a piece. And it all made very ferocious sense. Between the World and Me is one of those books that possess the powerful inevitability of a natural phenomenon – as if it accrued out of the ether that surrounds us, a crystalline formation of the outrage that defines the moment. To criticize is beside the point. It’s just there. To me, the key passage in Between the World and Me, comes after Coates has been on television explaining to the host the desperate consequences of yet another police assassination of a black boy. I came out of the studio and walked for a while. It was a calm December day. Families, believing themselves white, were out on the streets. Infants, raised to be white, were bundled in strollers. And I was sad for these people, much as I was sad for the host and sad for all the people out there watching and reveling in a specious hope. I realized then why I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream. I have seen that dream all my life. It is perfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways. The Dream is treehouses and the Cub Scouts. The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake. Right then, reading that passage, I knew that white people were going to love this book. What white people crave – more, they require it, they require it to live – is an alibi from their whiteness, an escape from the injustice of their existence. There are various alibis available depending on how much stupidity you can tolerate. You can say to yourself or to others that black people are stupid and lazy; you can say that you don’t see color; you can call your uncle a racist so everybody knows you’re not; you can share the latest critique of brutality on Twitter with the word THIS; and now you can tell a friend that she really has to read Between the World and Me. Because that Dream of Whiteness, the dream of treehouses and cub scouts that tastes like peppermint and smells like strawberry shortcake, is a perfect alibi. Who lives that dream? Somebody else may live it but not me, not anyone I know, no one I could see in Burlington. That’s a dream that belongs to somebody else. Always to somebody else. It certainly didn’t belong to the Winegard factory workers who were drifting to their cars at the end of their shift. The whiteness of my existence was my iPhone and the fumes of bourbon and beer, and the game from last night and the tingling in my thigh. The tingling in my thigh was my body – the reality I can’t look at because I’m too afraid of my mortality. To me, the best question ever asked about race in America has always been the one that James Baldwin asked, when an interviewer wanted to know if he was optimistic or pessimistic about the future of America. “What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place,” he said. “If you invented him, you, the white people invented him, then you’ve got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that.” The obsession of intellectuals over the question of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, Jr active or passive resistance – was moot; the pressing matter was why white people were blowing up churches filled with children. Whiteness is a spiritual distortion, evidently – by the fruit ye shall know the tree. And on the question of white pathology, what good answers has America produced since Baldwin asked that question in 1963? And now that white pathology has returned to waste away its host, unexamined and mysterious, a golem. In the evening, I finished the book and didn’t want to think about my white and male body any more, or the tingling in my thigh. Across from my hotel, the Fun City complex contained an imitation midway, a bowling alley, a couple of bars, a replica diner and, tucked in between a hotel and a spa, the Catfish Bend Casino. The poker room is dingy but serviceable. A game started at six. I wanted to play. I wanted to find out how much fun can you have in a place called Fun City. The youngest guy at the table, Curved Baseball Hat, grew beans and corn. A man with an angry mustache ran the conversation, a three-day beard beside him adding an occasional aside. The rest of us sat cooking quietly in the juices of our addictions, like in any casino. Everybody at the table knew everybody else, except for me and a black welder in town for a specialist job. It was happy hour in Fun City, and beer was a dollar. Everybody ordered a mess of them. And I felt just how lucky it is to be in America, despite politics, despite everything. Cheap beer and frank people and an honestly run game in a clean room. Even compared to Canada, the unthinking prosperity of the place is dazzling. Three Day Beard had seen Trump the night before, and Angry Mustache asked his opinion. “I think he could win,” Three Day Beard said cautiously, as if it were a criticism, as if it were all you could say of him, that he might have a chance to take the presidency, for what it was worth. “Don’t matter,” said Angry Mustache. “No matter who gets in, Washington just ruins them.” “He might be different because he doesn’t need the money.” Angry Mustache quoted a statistic, which I later check and turns out to be bullshit, that all congressmen become millionaires by the time they’ve been in office for a year. Everybody agreed that Trump’s main advantage is that he comes pre-corrupted. “It’s not even the money,” Three Day Beard said. “They get there. They all have these schemes and plans. They can’t do anything.” Three Day Beard almost pitied the politicians. “It’s all broken,” added Angry Mustache as a kind of given, the way you’d state any historical fact, like “Germany lost the second world war” or “Frances Farmer was once a star.” The view of American politics in Fun City is snug despair. It is despair not just at who happens to be in power but at whoever could ever be in power. It is despair not simply that the system is broken but that any system, imaginable in the current iteration of the United States, would turn out to be just as broken. The choice is a choice between impotence and coercion. The response was not revolution but a shrug. Curved Baseball Hat, the guy who grows corn and beans and who had delicate traces of soil in the lunulae of his fingernails, asked about an old gambling hall that used to be in town, and the reminiscences of the way Burlington used to be flowed – buildings that had been knocked down, women that were once beautiful and were now dead, fortunes made and vanished. Eventually the black player, who has said almost nothing except his calls and folds and raises, busted out. “Did you see that guy’s fingers?” Angry Mustache asks when he had left. He gestured an inch past his middle finger. We were all, it was made very clear, in a room of white men. “You know what they say. My brother worked in the prison and he says it’s all true. I guess that’s why they say once you go black.” The rest of us nodded or smiled or said nothing, looking down at the cards. Now that we had all shown how white we were, it was a friendlier room. We knew that none of us would object to the evil of the others. What if the answer to Baldwin’s question is as banal as it appeared to be in Fun City? What if it white people make the nigger to make themselves a little less lonely? And I said nothing. I offered no resistance, though the line between the man in Fun City and the cop shooting a black child in the face was not hard to trace. Here was my alibi that evening: I am Canadian. Which means I am a spy from nowhere. Or perhaps I am a coward or something in between a coward and spy from nowhere. It’s a pretty threadbare alibi anyway. Whose isn’t? Conversation drifted back to Trump. It was more polite. “I can see Trump,” said Angry Mustache. “He’s not the worst that I’ve seen anyway.” “I’m starting to like that doctor,” Three Day Beard adds as an afterthought. That doctor, Ben Carson, proposes a flat tax of 10% that would put the US government, estimating conservatively, in a $3tn deficit. He believes that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain, and he believes that Hitler never would have risen to power if the German people were armed, and that Obamacare is worse than slavery, and that Americans are living in a Gestapo age. I wish that Coates had some crazy scheme, some utopian fantasy for communards in Georgia, or the return to one motherland or another, but he just wants the end of white supremacy. He just wants white people in America to grow up, to cede their inhumane sense of absurd superiority. I cannot imagine why they would. It’s fun to drink and to play cards and to imagine what Donald Trump would say to the Mexican president the day after he was elected, or whether Ben Carson would set the flat tax at 10 or 12%. The ultimate alibi is ignorance – it lies closest to innocence – but if you can’t manage ignorance, craziness does nearly as well. I mean, none of it’s going to happen anyway, right? Whoever gets elected, it’s just going to be gridlock and outrage anyway, right? Did I mention that beer cost one dollar? A single, solitary buck. The Bernie Sanders rally in Davenport was the precise opposite of the Donald Trump rally in Burlington and yet precisely the same in every detail. “Make America Great Again” was replaced by “Feel the Bern”. Hawkers sold pins, three for $10. They read “Bernie Sanders is my spirit animal” and “Cats for Bernie” and “I supported Bernie Sanders before it was cool.” Davenport, at least near the Adler Theater, is the same Brooklyn-outside-Brooklyn that has conquered every corner of the world that is not a strip mall. The tattoo artists of Davenport do not go hungry. The cornfed hipsters at the Sanders rally look like they have probably attended a party at which somebody played a bongo. They may even have attended a literary reading. There were hype men as with Trump, too, although in this case they were twentyish women in glasses screaming “Feel the Bern!” and “We’re Going to Build a Revolution!” Somebody with a camera from NBC asked a group who has brought their precocious children because they want them to be engaged in the political process “Can I get you guys to look like you’re excited about Bernie?” They carefully placed their drinks on the floor, out of sight, to oblige. The same specter of angry white people haunts Saunders’s rally, the same sense of longing for a country that was, the country that has been taken away. The Bernie crowd brought homemade signs instead of manufactured ones, because I guess they’re organic. They waved them just the same. They were going to a show. They wanted to be a good audience. The fundamental difference between the Trump and Sanders crowd was that the Sanders crowd has more money, the natural consequence of the American contradiction machinery: rich white people can afford to think about socialism, the poor can only afford their anger. Sanders’s opening act was a congressional hopeful, Gary Kroeger. He hadn’t been on The Apprentice but on Saturday Night Live, a forgettable lesser actor from the great period between 1982 and 1985. He started out, naturally, with a half-assed gag: “the fresh patchouli in the air is so beautiful”. The sign language translator offered a mild smile to indicate it was a joke. Then, after a brief foray into leftwingery, calling America a “social democracy also known as a republic”, Kroeger took a big selfie with the crowd behind him: “Ellen Degeneres, eat your heart out!” he shouted. Everyone’s phones rose up to take pictures of themselves in a picture imitating a picture from the Oscars: such was American socialism in the year 2015. A few desultory bands followed, performing an assortment of leftwing songs from various historical leftwing movements. They harmonized on The Auld Triangle, a prison ballad that was covered on Inside Llewelyn Davis. The singer from Alice in Chains (remember them?) did an electric version of I Won’t Back Down. An old The Clash song, Jail Guitar Doors, was sung by the subject of the first verse, Wayne Kramer. And it was all, so obviously, a nostalgia act, the indulgence for a longing of a time when music encouraged politics, when activism possessed an artistic face, and vice versa. Eventually Bernie wandered out. The phones went up. The phones went down. “Enough is enough,” he shouted, leaving blank what there’s been enough of. And then he talked about how he wanted to end the war on drugs and campaign finance reform and government that isn’t for plutocrats, and how they were going to build a revolution (such an embarrassing word to hear uttered out loud), and America was going to be a social democracy, by the people of the people. Sanders’s exasperation was the principal fact to be communicated, more than any political content. Trump was about winning again. Sanders was about having lost. The vagueness of American politics is what astonished the outsider. It’s all about feelings and God and bullshit. Sanders actually uttered the following sentence out loud: “What we’re saying is when millions of people come together to restore their government we can do extraordinary things.” Nobody asked what he meant. Nobody asked for numbers. They applauded. Better to take it in the spirit in which it’s given, like a Catskills resort comedian. Sanders reminded me of a line from Seinfeld, maybe because Larry David’s SNL parody was only a few days’ old. “The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup at a deli.” When Ben and Jerry make a Bernie Sanders ice cream, I hope it’s chili and ginger: the delicious hot flavour of nasal-passage clearing outrage. Sanders’s speech was much shorter than Trump’s. There had already been the music, I guess. I had the impression, as with Trump, that I had traveled many hundreds of miles to look at a man’s hair. Bernie Sanders’s hair is as much a statement as Trump’s. It looks like the hair of a tenured professor whose wife has stopped nagging him to get a haircut because the nagging doesn’t work. You couldn’t muss Sanders hair. The disorder is just as much an aesthetic as the comb-over. I mean it always looks the same. Somebody is cutting it to droop that way over the ears. As despair has suddenly spread like a fabulous mist over the white people of America, as the white people die off in their unprecedented numbers, the commenters are surprised, a bit, but they have no plan of action. No policy proposals aim at ameliorating the conditions of white people. How could they? If you believe the Case and Deaton report, white people are victims of their own privilege – literally. Their cherished right to own guns, and the vast increase in the ownership of weaponry, means that their suicide attempts are more effective. They have more access to opioids because doctors are more likely to trust white people with them. They have the money to make themselves lonely and drink. I remember reading a passage from bell hooks once, the kind that circulates on Facebook because it sounds slightly unusual in its predictable virtue. “The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males,” she wrote, “is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage is psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves.” Her compassion is admirable, glorious even, but also inaccurate. No one is more emotional than a piece-of-shit white man. They are sentimentality personified. How else can so many be moved to rage over the absence of a Christmas tree on a Starbucks cup? That dream, that white dream that smells like peppermint and tastes like strawberry shortcake, comes with a cost of shit. If you take shit, if you eat shit, if you live through the shit, if you survive the stupid wars and the meaningless jobs, you should be sure of who you are and what you deserve. And if you are not sure and you have not received what you deserved, why did you take and eat and breathe all that shit? In the aftermath of that deal, the choice, I suppose, is either to be proud to be white, which is a form of insanity, or to fantasize a post-racial cosmopolis, which is a kind of make-believe, or to be ashamed. So much easier to forget those choices, or to defer endlessly the choosing, or to debate the difficulties of choosing infinitely, because white male flesh is not under mortal threat, as the flesh of black men or the flesh of women. Our bodies are safe. Our bodies are the threat. In medieval monarchies, the state required the existence of a double body, one for the real world and one for the symbolic. There was the flawed and mortal body of the king, which wept and shat and screwed and died, and then there was the Body of the King, sacred, pure, indestructible. Race gives us all double bodies, “double consciousness” in WEB Du Bois’s phrase, whatever you want to call having to live mortally through the judgment of others. The new white distortion, the sickness at heart, the pathology, may simply be the arrival of the awareness of two bodies: the dizziness and nausea that arrive with the onset of double vision. Because they have to be like everybody else, their hearts are breaking in half. The morning after the Sanders rally, I found enough strength to look in the mirror at my white and male body, to examine its mortal and symbolic nature. At the corner of my groin, where it had been tingling, a brown patch spilled like spoiled milk down my skin. A wide brown patch shaped like post-climate change Florida in the corner of my thigh. Instantly, I knew I would die. And the next moment I started driving back to Toronto, to my wife and children, flesh of my flesh. Bernie Sanders wants a revolution to overthrow casino capitalism but the problem, or maybe just the first problem, is that the American people love casinos. They can’t build them fast enough. On the road from Iowa, I passed at least a dozen, a dozen Fun Cities of various shapes and sizes, enduring various conversations about Trump and Sanders. The highways of Illinois are a unique vision of the workings of human desire – a nearly limitless marketplace for addiction and its cure. Strip clubs or fried chicken or gambling or church or rehab or cancer treatment. The I-94 spoke right to the unwounded body – the promise of processed sugar and pussy, or salvation from them. There was one other attraction on the route home: Ronald Reagan’s birthplace in Tampico. The beauty of the landscape around those towns, for some reason, has never been properly romanticized. There are no tourist buses to these fields, as there are to the ocean or the mountains, but the landscape is every bit as sublime. Reagan’s childhood passed in the loin of the continent, the grand hinge between the industrial core of the Great Lakes and the agricultural heartland. The historical memory of his presidential monuments has been consumed by fantasies of small-town life but it is a landscape of whitewashed buildings against the undulating emptiness, a country roiling with dreams. You can picture Reagan as a boy in these fields, dreaming of movies and America – vast screens on which he could project himself. The highway runs like a river of craving through an ancient dream. The ancient dreams are still so vivid here. In the United States, 240-year-old writings can be recited by heart by people who cannot be described as educated. Documents written by men who owned slaves are spoken of as if they could solve the problems of today and tomorrow and any conceivable future no matter how distant. Thomas Jefferson believed that the constitution should expire after 19 years, so that the dead would not have dominion over the living. That fate seems to have arrived. The Americans are in constant debates with ghosts and their conversations with dead people are most powerful, most ferocious, at exactly the points where they are most nonsensical. They state defiantly that all men are created equal when any casual observer of life knows they aren’t. They claim that men and women should be judged by the content of their character, when nobody can know the content of another’s character. These dreams, these impossibilities, are the absolute and real foundation of their nation. And the dreams are so entrancing that it’s unclear whether the problem is that the Americans believe them, or that they don’t. It’s supremely childish, either way. Back in Toronto, my wife took a look at the brown patch on my groin and sent me to a doctor, and the doctor told me it was a rash from running too much, and I had been given the greatest gift anyone can hope for, in this time and this place. I had been forgiven, for a while, for my body.",2015-08-31 13:36:15,The white man pathology: inside the fandom of Sanders and Trump,,1751,https://www.theguardian.com/us
117,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/29/hillary-clinton-really-is-coming-for-your-guns.html,"SEARCH Some politicians talk about gun control once in a while. Clinton has been pushing to curb firearms for decades. No wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down. Washington Bureau Chief Editor's Note: Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to tackle gun violence on Oct. 5, including the repeal of liability protection for gun manufactuerers; closing the gunshow loophole, which allows people to buy firearms without background checks from private sellers; preventing gun purchases from being finalized before a background check is completed. “Something is deeply wrong,” Hillary Clinton told the audience at the Democratic National Committee on Friday. Earlier in the week, a gunman killed two journalists in Roanoke, Virginia, on live television, just days before an unstable person with a gun murdered a highway state trooper in Louisiana. It all points to a national sickness, an impotence when it comes to curbing the spread of firearms to dangerous individuals, Clinton said. “I believe we can have common sense gun reform that keeps weapons out of the hands that should not have them—domestic abusers, the violently unstable—while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.” Hillary Clinton has long pushed to regulate access to guns. In her Friday speech, she pledged her presidency would be no different. “Now I know the politics are hard. I know that some would rather throw up their hands and give up the fight, but not me. I’m not going to sit by while more good people die across America,” she said. Of course, it’s easy for candidates for president—especially Democratic candidates for president—to say they’re going to do something on guns. Actually accomplishing anything is much harder—like Labor-of-Hercules difficult. After the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting that killed 20 elementary school students and six of their teachers, President Obama made a massive push for relatively modest gun regulation. He got nothing. But for Clinton, gun control has been a significant part of her political identity. She’s been working to regulate the firearms industry for decades, and had a front row seat the last time a president actually managed to pass any gun-control measure. In other words: other candidates may say they’re coming for unregulated guns. Clinton really is. No wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down. Her experiences in the ’90s—and the massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in particular—seemed to shape her views and belief that the laws needed to change to better protect people. The Clinton administration came into the White House in 1993 with a pledge to sign the Brady Bill, which implemented a five-day waiting period and a background check in order to buy a handgun. Once Bill Clinton was in the office, he worked with former White House press secretary James Brady and his wife, Sarah, to pass the bill. And it was over the course of that fight Hillary Clinton forged a strong friendship with Sarah. In her book, Living History, Clinton marveled at the Bradys’ strength. “The bill wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless efforts of James and Sarah Brady,” she wrote. “He and his indomitable wife, Sarah, had dedicated their lives to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.” “Hillary was always really supportive, there was never a time it was in question,” said a longtime friend of Sarah Brady, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly about their relationship. “They became incredibly close—close on the issue and close personally.” Sarah and James, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary before he was shot during an assassination attempt in 1981, both appeared at the 1992 Democratic convention in support of the Clintons. When Sarah Brady published her book in 2002, Hillary spoke at her book party in Washington, D.C. If the Bradys’ tenacity on the issue inspired Clinton, the mass shooting at Columbine High School emboldened her to push for changes to gun laws—particularly the so-called gun show loopholes. On April 20, 1999, two teenagers murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher in Littleton, Colorado. It was the deadliest school shooting in American history up to that point. And it sent the country into a debate over easy access to firearms. A month after Columbine shootings, Bill and Hillary Clinton traveled to the shattered Denver suburb to meet with the families who lost their children in the violence. Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman at the time, said one by one the Clintons were introduced to family members who had lost their kin. “It is hard to describe how unspeakably tragic it is to meet family after family all sitting in room with their loved ones, all of whom have lost a child, a brother or sister, to senseless gun violence,” Lockhart, who accompanied the Clintons to Littleton after the Columbine massacre, said. “It’s impossible to fully measure how it will impact any given person, but I’m certain that it forever impacts any leader who has to go through it.” Clinton described the meetings as “gut-wrenching” in her memoir. She reflected on seeing “the faces of parents who were living through their worst nightmare, dealing with the loss of their own children in such a senseless, disturbing act of violence.” “Parents and teenagers alike asked Bill and me to make sure these horrible losses were not in vain,” she wrote. So when President Clinton launched a nationwide ad campaign to draw awareness to youth violence and formed a task force to examine why the nation’s youth had become increasingly prone to violence, Hillary became deeply involved. Jeff Bleich, who served as the director of the White House Commission on Youth Violence, said Hillary Clinton was very active in his group. “My main impression overall,” he said, “was that she stayed with the issue.  Some people in government lost focus on youth violence as soon as the next crisis occurred, but she and her office continued to check in to see how the program was going.” And while the politics of gun control changed dramatically once her husband left the White House, Clinton kept at the issue once she got to the Senate, where she was a reliable vote for gun-safety measures. She supported renewing the assault weapons ban and barring the sale of high-capacity magazines. “She’s worked on these issues for a really long time—she really comes to this as an advocate for kids and families,” said Neera Tanden, president of Center for American Progress and a longtime Hillary Clinton aide. When Clinton announced her candidacy for the Senate in February 2000, she pledged “to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children, for closing the gun-show loophole, requiring child safety locks and licensing all new handgun owners.” She also co-sponsored several bills aimed at closing the so-called “gun show loophole” and voted to renew the assault weapons ban in 2004. These efforts, however, all came up short, and the Bill Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired. The gun-control measures were good politics in New York. But by 2008, when Hillary was running for national office, she softened her position a bit. When asked by NBC’s Tim Russert whether she would implement a plan wherein “everyone who wishes to purchase a gun should have a license, and that every handgun sale or transfer should be registered in a national registry,” during a presidential debate in 2008, Clinton said it was not politically possible. “Well, I am against illegal guns, and illegal guns are the cause of so much death and injury in our country,” she said. “I also am a political realist and I understand that the political winds are very powerful against doing enough to try to get guns off the street, get them out of the hands of young people.” In other words, the pivot on gun control was temporary, tiny. She added, “We need to have a registry that really works, with good information about people who are felons, people who have been committed to mental institutions like the man in Virginia Tech who caused so much death and havoc. We need to make sure that that information is in a timely manner, both collected and presented.” The years since the 2008 campaign have been an exercise in frustration for the gun-control movement. And in today’s presidential race, Clinton’s nearest Democratic competitor—Bernie Sanders—voted against the Brady Bill and has a record on gun control that looks much more right-leaning than far left. Sanders represents Vermont, where gun laws are pretty much nonexistent, but those views and votes might not sit well with some of the more hard-core Democratic voters. As one Democratic voter told The Daily Beast, Sanders is “using phrases that the gun extremists and the NRA use, saying things like it’s about people not liking guns… A lot of us are super Bernie Sanders supporters and we were all really disappointed that he could talk about it this way.” NRA chief Wayne LaPierre, on the other hand, had nothing but bile for Sanders’s opponent. “I vow on this day the NRA will stand shoulder to shoulder with you and good, honest decent Americans,” he said during April’s NRA convention, “and we will stand and fight with everything we’ve got and in 2016, by God, we will elect the next great president of the United States of America and it will not be Hillary Rodham Clinton.” For the Democratic front-runner, it was a rather sweet endorsement.",2015-08-29 00:13:00,Hillary Clinton Really Is Coming For Your Guns,,1707,http://www.thedailybeast.com/

          / CBS News Some public health officials say gun violence, just like car accidents and smoking-related illness, can be prevented, or at least reduced. According to the latest figures from the United Nations, the United States has about 4 percent of the world population, but nearly half of the civilian-owned guns around the world. With gun violence also on the rise in America, some public health officials say it's time to change our approach to the problem. The recent on air-attack of a reporter and her cameraman is not the first time we have seen a horrific shooting. It's not the first time it's been recorded. But for many this is a first: thinking about gun violence the same way we think about car accidents or smoking -  as a public health issue. The real tragedy here is that a lot of this is preventable, says Executive Director of the American Public Health Association George Benjamin. ""Seat belts and airbags and everything else we have in cars now has dramatically reduced deaths,"" he said.  ""We can do the same with firearms."" The website ShootingTracker.com estimates that once a day in this country, four or more people have been shot in a mass shooting so far this year. According to the CDC, more than 90 people are killed by a firearm every day. ""It's getting worse,"" said Benjamin. ""Just a look at what is happening in many of our big cities, a lot of it is gang-related, but no it's not always gang-related."" Benjamin says a public health campaign that focuses on securing guns in the home, increased firearm safety training and more screening of the mentally ill focuses less on politics and more on prevention. ""You can do it in a non-threatening manner,"" Benjamin said. ""And a non-threatening manner is what we need to move this issue forward."" John Lott, the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and author of the book, ""More Guns, Less Crime,"" says he does not buy the idea that gun violence should be treated as a public health issue. ""Every country in the world, or place in the world, that has banned guns has seen an increase in murder rate,"" Lott said. ""It's not just D.C. and Chicago."" There are some who will say this is just another attempt to restrict gun ownership and keep guns away from people. ""The 2nd Amendment is real,"" Benjamin said. ""We respect it, but let's figure out how to save lives together."" Benjamin says while the focus is on firearm involved homicides, gun use in suicides is far worse. The CDC says for every homicide in this country, two people take their own lives using a gun. First published on August 27, 2015 / 7:00 PM © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

          / CBS News By Sarah Dutton and Jennifer De Pinto, Fred Backus and Anthony Salvanto With the presidential primary season now officially at a close, Hillary Clinton (43 percent) holds a six-point lead over Donald Trump (37 percent) - the same margin she led Trump by a month ago. Most of the interviewing for the poll was conducted before the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida Sunday. When former New Mexico Governor and current Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is added to the contest, he garners 11 percent of the vote, but the margin between Clinton and Trump changes little. With Johnson's name added, Clinton holds a seven-point lead nationally over Donald Trump, 39 percent to 32 percent. More voters expect Clinton will eventually win in November. Fifty-one percent expect Hillary Clinton to finally win the 2016 presidential election, compared to just 35 percent that expects Trump to win. Most Republicans think Trump will win, while Democrats and independents think Clinton is more likely. In the aftermath of the Orlando, Florida nightclub shootings, there has been considerable focus on terrorism and gun policy. Clinton (50 percent) leads Trump (43 percent) on handling terrorism and national security, while voters divide on which candidate would do a better job on gun policy -- Clinton has 46 percent support, compared to 45 percent for Trump. Hillary Clinton's email account and server remains an issue for her; two thirds of voters think that Clinton did something wrong when she set up a personal email address and server for work while she was Secretary of State. Forty-one percent think what she did was illegal, and another 25 percent think it was improper but not illegal. Just 26 percent of voters say she did nothing wrong. Unsurprisingly, there are partisan differences, and Republicans are highly critical of her actions - 71 percent think what Clinton did was illegal. Among Democrats, 43 percent say she did nothing wrong, and another 31 percent said she did something improper but not illegal. Among independents, 42 percent think she broke the law. Nearly nine in ten voters say they have heard at least something about Clinton's use of a personal email address and server, including 59 percent who say they have heard a lot about it. Among those who have heard or read a lot about this, 52 percent think Clinton's actions were illegal. Donald Trump is also facing some controversy over the lawsuits against Trump University and his statements about the judge handling those cases. Trump has said that the judge has a conflict of interest due to his Mexican heritage, but voters disagree. Seventy-nine percent of voters don't think the judge's heritage matters; just 14 percent see a conflict of interest. Seven in ten voters find Trump's comments about the judge's heritage and conflict of interest offensive, including 55 percent of Republicans and 42 percent of Trump supporters. Twenty-four percent say his comments were not offensive. Four in ten voters think Trump did something wrong regarding his Trump University business, including 22 percent who say it was illegal. Like the questions on Clinton's email, views on Trump's business practices regarding Trump University are partisan: 40 percent of Republicans think he did nothing wrong, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats. However, overall a third of voters don't know enough to have an opinion, including a third of Republicans. Two thirds have heard or read at least something about this issue. Still, most Republican voters (74 percent) think leaders of the Republican Party should support him even if they disagree with him on important issues, although that number has dipped slightly from 80 percent last month. Clinton has an advantage over Trump on handling an international crisis. Fifty-four percent of voters have at least some confidence in Clinton's ability to handle an international crisis, compared to 38 percent who say that about Trump. Still, both of the party's presumptive nominees are viewed negatively on some key characteristics. More than six in ten don't think either Clinton or Trump is honest and trustworthy - unchanged from last month. And few voters (about a third) say these candidates make them feel inspired about the future. Voters are also skeptical of their judgment. Sixty-nine percent of voters say Trump does not show good judgment, while fewer -- but still more than half -- say that about Clinton (52 percent). Each candidate does have their strengths, however. Fifty-nine percent of voters say Clinton is prepared for the job of president, compared to 30 percent who think Trump is prepared. Trump is viewed as more of a straight-talker; 56 percent think Trump says what he believes, while 62 percent think Clinton mostly says what people want to hear. Neither Trump nor Clinton is seen as a uniter by a majority of voters: 68 percent say a Trump presidency would divide Americans. Even though 41 percent think a Clinton presidency would bring groups of Americans together, more - 51 percent - think that would divide the country. Empathy is not a particular strength for either candidate, although 45 percent of voters say Clinton understands the needs and problems of people like them, compared to 31 percent for Trump. Looking at two other important issues facing the country, 51 percent of voters think Clinton would do a better job on illegal immigration, while 43 percent pick Trump. The candidates are even -- 47 percent each --on who would best handle the economy and jobs. Overall views of the presumptive nominees have changed little and remain negative. The major party candidates are well-known to voters, and more than half have an unfavorable opinion of both Clinton (52 percent) and Trump (58 percent). When compared to past likely nominees at a similar point in the election cycle, Trump and Clinton's unfavorable ratings continue to be the highest in CBS News polling going back to 1984, when the question was first asked. Clinton continues to enjoy strong support from liberals, moderates, women, African Americans, and voters under 45, while Donald Trump gets the support of men - particularly white men - Republicans, conservatives, and white voters without a college degree. Most registered voters say they have made up their minds about who to support: 87 percent of Trump voters and 89 percent of Clinton voters say they won't change their minds before the election. But just over a third of each candidate's supporters say they strongly favor their choice. About a quarter of both Trump and Clinton voters are supporting their candidate mainly because they dislike the opposition. Only 32 percent of voters are very enthusiastic about the 2016 presidential election, and there is little difference between Clinton and Trump voters. Overall, enthusiasm is down from the beginning of the year: now 23 percent of voters say they are not at all enthusiastic, up from 15 percent in January before the primary season began. Nevertheless, six in 10 voters are paying a lot of attention to the 2016 presidential campaign, and two-thirds say the campaign is interesting -- 23 percent say it is dull. President Obama's job approval rating At 53 percent, President Obama's job approval rating is the highest it has been since December 2012. And evaluations of his handling of foreign policy have inched up slightly: now, 45 percent approve -- the highest since May 2013. Forty-nine percent approve of how he is handling the economy. But just 25 percent of voters would like to see the President's policies continued, unchanged since March. And the President's endorsement of fellow-Democrat Hillary Clinton in this year's presidential election may not do much to sway voters. 69 percent say his endorsement makes no difference, and just 13 percent say they are more likely to support her as a result. Among Democrats, 25 percent say Obama's endorsement of Clinton makes them more likely to support her. Seventeen percent of those who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries say the same about Obama's endorsement of Clinton. Forty percent of voters think the news media has treated Donald Trump worse than other candidates - twice as many as say the same about the media's treatment of Clinton. With the Democratic primaries and caucuses over, nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters (64 percent) think Bernie Sanders should now support Hillary Clinton for president. But those who backed Sanders in the primaries want him to fight to become the nominee at the Democratic convention in July. A majority of Sanders voters - 57 percent - don't think the process for selecting the Democratic nominee this year was fair, though six in 10 will nevertheless support Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in November. Just 8 percent will vote for Donald Trump. Sanders voters appear to be happy with the idea of a Clinton-Sanders ticket. Seventy-five percent of them would like to see Clinton pick Sanders as her running mate. Registered voters overall divide on whether Clinton should choose Sanders, but 58 percent of Democratic voters like the idea. More independents support the idea than not. Those who backed Clinton in the primaries are split --45 percent support and the same percentage oppose --on whether the presumptive nominee should put Sanders on her ticket. Four out of five voters say the U.S. is ready to elect a woman for president, a doubling of the percentage that said so twenty years ago. Eighty-two percent of men, and 76 percent of women, agree, as do majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents. Seventy-two percent of voters say they hope to see a woman president in their lifetime, up from 63 percent eight years ago. Seventy-six percent of women, and two thirds of men, hope to see this happen. This poll was conducted by telephone June 9-13, 2016 among a random sample of 1,280 adults nationwide, including 1,048 registered voters. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones. The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables. The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus three percentage points. The margin of error for the sample of registered voters is four points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.

132,http://observer.com/2015/08/wdbj-killer-tweeted-video-and-motive-before-shooting-himself,"Journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward were allegedly killed by a former employee who tweeted about his crime before killing himself. (Photo: Twitter) The entire country was shocked and saddened this morning when two journalists were shot at a Virginia shopping mall. Reporter Allison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, who worked for WDBJ, a CBS affiliate in Roanoke, were killed while filming a live segment at Bridgewater Plaza. Vicki Gardner, the woman Ms. Parker was interviewing, was also shot in the back and is now in surgery.
Police pursued Vester L. Flanagan, a disgruntled former WDBJ reporter, as a suspect in the shooting. Mr. Flanagan shot himself after a confrontation with police, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
Obviously tragedies like this always lead to debates about gun control and mental health—and Twitter was certainly full of opinions on those topics Wednesday morning.
But the most chilling detail about America’s latest mass shooting was the killer’s presence on social media after the event.
Mr. Flanagan, who used the name Bryce Williams in his work at WDBJ and on Twitter, tweeted out a video of the shooting, and also seemingly confessed his motive.  He claimed that “Alison (sic) made racist comments” and “Adam went to hr on me after working with me one time!”

Mr. Flanagan’s Twitter account was suspended soon after the information about him became public, presumably to avoid his getting attention that he didn’t deserve.
Through his social media stunt, Mr. Flanagan left an enduring reminder of his terrible actions, along with a template for what not to do on social media. Enough vitriol was spread on Twitter before, and Mr. Flanagan’s actions add a disturbing new twist.
Every shooting since Sandy Hook has gotten its own hashtag and unleashed torrents of online outrage. With the heartless new tactic that Mr. Flanagan used this morning, let’s hope concrete action is taken so that anyone who wants to make news by harnessing the power of social media for violent ends is discouraged.

All rights reserved. BILLBOARD is a registered trademark of Billboard IP Holdings, LLC Darius Rucker photographed at CMA Fest in Nashville, Tennessee. Darius Rucker has dedicated ""Amazing Grace"" to Charleston, South Carolina, a city still raw from June’s church massacre. Rucker's emotional dedication came during taping of CMT's Instant Jam in Charleston, where the hometown hero performed an acapella version of the classic song and alluded to the mid-year tragedy. Sources at the taping say he told the audience: ""We went through a lot crap recently. The tragedy broke my heart. The greatest feeling I've had in a long time is when that played out and our city didn't divide. We said this is us. We said to that guy that lives in a time that doesn't exist anymore, 'you wanted to mess with our city and instead you brought us together.'""

This song goes out to our city."" Rucker’s dedication Charleston is a timely one. A disgruntled former employee of WDBJ, Vester Lee Flanagan (also known on-air as Bryce Williams), this week allegedly shot to death two reporters during a live broadcast in Roanoke, Virginia before turning the gun on himself. Before the attack, Flanagan is reported to have shared a 23-page manifesto, in which he said the June 17 church shooting in Charleston was “the tipping point” for his action. Charleston lost nine people in the mass shooting. Darius Rucker Makes Fashionable Entrance on Country Albums Chart With 'Southern Style' In addition to Rucker’s dedication, he performed a surprise cover of the ‘90s Blackstreet classic ""No Diggity,"" John Mellencamp’s ‘80s anthem ""Pink Houses"" and the Hootie & the Blowfish staples ""Let Her Cry"" and ""Only Wanna Be With You"". Demonstrating his connection with his fans, Rucker stopped mid-performance to have medics assist a woman suffering from heat exhaustion. The show was taped on the beach right outside of Charleston and will air Sept. 5 on CMT at 10pm ET. Rucker -- who issued his debut country album Learn To Live in 2008 -- most recently hit the Hot Country Songs top 10 with “Homegrown Honey.” His latest album is his fourth to top the Billboard Country Albums chart.

8.30.2015 9:30 AM  ""I've been a human powder keg for a while….just waiting to go BOOM."" Said Vester Lee Flanagan II in a fax to ABC News. Flanagan had sent the fax shortly after he shot two former co-workers on August 26, 2015. It is unclear if Flanagan suffered from any form of mental illness but should he have been able to access to a firearm? Here is a video that looks at the truth behind mental illness and gun ownership. Original release date was November 19, 2013 and the original writeup is below. In the wake of any mass shooting, there's a predictable and justified burst of public outrage and sorrow followed by a series of ""do something now"" legislative proposals meant to prevent similar tragedies from ever occurring again. Depending on the political leanings of the politician or media figure offering the solution, the proposal often rests upon one of these twin assumptions: We must rid the world of the wrong kinds of weapons (i.e., ""assault weapons""), or, we must keep guns away from the wrong kinds of people (i.e., ""crazy people""). ""How many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame from a national media machine that rewards them with wall-to-wall attention and a sense of identity that they crave, while provoking others to try to make their mark?"" asked Wayne LaPierre, official lightning rod of the National Rifle Association, in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary shooting. ""A dozen more killers, a hundred more? How can we possibly even guess how many, given our nation's refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill?"" Even the nation's premier gun lobby believes keeping guns away from the mentally ill is a good idea. It's a sensible-sounding proposal, a logical precaution. But some forensic psychiatrists, whose jobs include the task of identifying potentially violent individuals, say that targeting the mentally ill isn't as simple as it sounds. Watch the Reason TV video above, ""The Truth About Mental Illness and Guns,"" to hear more about flawed gun control policies and for the full story behind the Phillips' gun confiscation experience.

136,http://abcnews.go.com/US/virginia-high-school-features-confederate-flag/story?id=33238437,"The small VA high school is proud of its Confederate flag. — -- The front doors of Hurley High School in small-town Hurley, VA are proudly emblazoned with the blue stripes of the Confederate Flag, despite a renewed uproar recently over the use of the rebel banner following the racially charged massacre at a Charleston, SC church. “It’s been with us since the beginning of our high school. It’s just what the people are used to seeing. It’s about our heritage and culture,” said Pam Dotson, principal of Hurley High School. Public schools in Charleston, SC have recently banned students from displaying the Confederate flag on school grounds following June’s mass shooting allegedly by Dylann Roof, who openly posed with the flag in several photos. However, Dotson says she has received only one complaint and that the response from parents and the community has been largely positive. She does not anticipate that conflict will come from continuing to display the flag as a symbol of the school. “I think it’s just about censorship and politics,” Dotson said. “We are who we are here, and it’s nothing to do with hatred or racism.” Chris Hardin, a graduate of Hurley High School, painted a logo of the Confederate flag waving from the blade of a sword on the Hurley Rebels football field. He sports the rebel flag on his car and is in the process of tattooing a picture of it on his friend's arm. To him, the mascot is representative of courage and toughness. Despite the national controversy, Dotson says Hurley High School has no plans to remove the flag from their mascot. “Our school is a small school – a very small group, close community – and our community in no way sees the display of our Confederate flag as a symbol of hatred,” Dotson said. “It’s just a symbol to us more of bravery and pride in our school and pride in our community.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",2015-08-21 21:10:38,Virginia High School Features the Confederate Flag,,39000,http://abcnews.go.com/

139,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/08/bill-oreilly-blames-rise-of-nihilism-and-secular-progressive-attitudes-for-virginia-journalists-deaths/,"Fox News host Bill O'Reilly argued on Thursday that secularism was a contributing factor to the shooting deaths of Alison Parker and Adam Ward, as well as other mass shooting attacks. ""Individuals in this country now, I believe, are tending away from spirituality and into the secular-progressive 'It's all about me,'"" he told Fox contributor Keith Ablow. ""And when you combine that with a mental illness, you have what you had in Virginia yesterday."" Both O'Reilly and Ablow declined to include Islamic extremists like Islamic State in their arguments, with the Factor host calling their beliefs ""a perversion of Islam."" However, O'Reilly argued that a lack of spiritual beliefs leaves a person without loyalties or purpose, outside of their own gratification. Psychotherapist Karen Ruskin pushed back on O'Reilly's argument, saying there have been cases where people who kill themselves or others do so despite having spiritual beliefs. ""Spirituality or non-spirituality does not mean you are mentally healthy or not mentally healthy,"" she said. O'Reilly cut her off, however, asking for specific cases. He did not mention that -- despite his protests at the time -- Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik identified himself as ""100 percent Christian"" when he killed 76 people in 2011. He also failed to account for conservative Christian Scott Roeder, who shot and killed George Tiller outside of his women's health clinic in Wichita in 2009. Jared Loughner, who killed six people while severely injuring then-Sen. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) just two years ago, was also reportedly associated with Christian anti-abortion groups. And Vester Flanagan, who killed Ward and Parker, said in his ""manifesto"" that Jehovah told him to act. While self-identified Christians have been responsible for several terror attacks, O'Reilly insisted that almost every killer on which he has reported on during his career has been a ""nihilist."" Watch the discussion, as posted online, below.  An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter. Whallon-Wolkind's identity as the unindicted co-conspirator was first reported by Alan Feuer, a reporter for the New York Times, on Twitter on Thursday. A knowledgeable source speaking on condition of anonymity provided the same information to Raw Story.                    No investigative story ever really ends. If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost."" The Washington Post published an excerpt from the book this week, and in the excerpt, Bender discusses a ""group of Trump's most hardcore rallygoers"" known as the Front Row Joes.

140,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/08/gun-violence-in-the-us-88-americans-shot-everyday-and-lawmakers-do-nothing/,"It was every parent’s worst nightmare. A 14-year-old boy, armed with a gun, walked into a classroom at his school and threatened to shoot anyone who called for help. Related:  Virginia shooting victim's father says he will need to buy gun to defend himself A three-hour standoff ensued at the Philip Barbour high school in Philippi, West Virginia on Tuesday. For much of it, 29 teenagers and their teacher did not know if they would live or die. Forty-five minutes passed before administrators at the school even became aware that a hostage situation was unfolding in a second-floor social studies class. Thus began a sequence of action that has become all too familiar for a nation besieged by gun violence and where schools are often a target: a 911 emergency call was placed and the school was quickly evacuated, as police responded and set up a barricade. Through calm negotiations in the most tense of atmospheres, the young gunman was ultimately  persuaded to release the hostages without injury  – and prevented from taking his own life – by a combination of authorities, the teacher and his own pastor, who offered his assistance when informed of the boy’s identity. But the resounding relief among parents, educators and law enforcement was tinged with the knowledge that it could have been far worse. Within seconds, Philip Barbour high school could have added its name to the list of school massacres – Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook – that hold worldwide notoriety and rank among the deadliest mass shootings in US history. And yet it was not this incident that captured public attention this week. The fatal shooting of two journalists  on live television in Moneta, Virginia  , on Wednesday cast a spotlight on the nation’s gun violence in an even more public fashion than the mass shootings in movie theaters and schools that came before it. Alison Parker, 24, and Andy Ward, 27, were shot and killed during a morning broadcast for WDBJ7, the TV station where they worked, by a resentful former colleague who had been dismissed two years earlier for erratic behavior. Viewers who had woken up to a light segment on local tourism in central Virginia suddenly bore witness to a gruesome double murder. The chaos was captured in all of two minutes: the firing of shots, the screams as the victims attempted to run, and then silence. The last frame on Ward’s camera would reveal the grainy image of a gunman walking casually away. Parker and Ward were both pronounced dead at the scene. Vicki Gardner, a third victim who was being interviewed by Parker, was shot in the back but survived. The shooter, Vester Lee Flanagan, 41, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being chased by police. Colleagues remembered Parker and Ward as full of promise, the kind of people who lit up the room with their energy and warmth. Both were in committed relationships – their partners not only worked at the same station, but watched from the control room on Wednesday morning as the people they were preparing to marry were killed. ••• Gabby Giffords Gun violence in America claims roughly 88 lives each day, according to data compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The shooting in Virginia would perhaps not have shocked the conscience of America had it fallen under the day-to-day gun violence that kills more than 32,000 per year. As Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot in the head in  a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona  , put it, what was unprecedented was not the shooting itself, but that two young journalists were executed on live TV. “Many times, shootings like these happen behind close doors, in homes and schools and movie theaters. But this time, the horror unfolded live and on air, for all to see,” Giffords said in a statement with her husband, Mark Kelly, through their anti-gun violence group  Americans for Responsible Solutions  . In the same week as the incident in Moneta, Virginia, Brianna Blackston saw her boyfriend Zachary McGee take his last breath, after he was shot outside a warehouse party in downtown Modesto, California. Police said eight people were shot, including McGee, who was pronounced dead at the hospital. Blackston walked out of the party to an eruption of gunfire. She was shot in the knees and hid under a car. “It felt like it was never going to stop,” Blackston told the Guardian. “It was like a video game.” Heather Graves, a spokeswoman for the Modesto police department, said police were still looking for the suspect in Sunday morning’s shooting. “We had two more murders that week so we were working diligently on those as well,” Graves added. In Cleveland, Ohio, 20-year-old Brionna Boddy was killed when a gunmen opened fire on a parked party bus, authorities said. A 26-year-old man and a 21-year-old man were also shot. Some guests inside a house party came outside to see what had happened, but went back inside when they saw nothing, telling the police: “It was just someone shooting in the air. It happens all the time.” In west Baltimore, 93-year-old Clara Canty was sitting on the steps of her rowhouse on Wednesday when a bullet grazed the top of her head. Canty had been caught in the crossfires of a shooting in her neighborhood that left a 23-year-old dead and a 17-year-old injured, police said. “It’s just something that I never experienced before. I never seen a person that got killed all of a sudden,” Canty  told the Baltimore Sun on Thursday  . Everytown for Gun Safety  , the group backed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, a vocal proponent of stricter gun laws, estimates that as many as  135 school shootings  have occurred since Newtown, in December 2012, resulting in at least 52 deaths and nearly 100 non-fatal gunshot injuries. This week, in addition to the close call in West Virginia, a third grader who brought a gun to school  accidentally shot a classmate  , and Mississippi State University  was placed on lockdown  after a student threatened to kill himself and others. In urban areas, the availability of firearms – mostly obtained illegally – has transformed gun violence into an intractable plague. In Chicago, one of the deadliest examples, there have been 1,897 shooting victims this year,  according to data  compiled by the Chicago Tribune. Among those victims in several shootings last Wednesday was a 14-year-old girl who was  struck while standing on a corner  . Barack Obama The intersection of domestic violence and guns has also spurred calls for reform, with advocates highlighting statistics that reveal a greater threat posed to victims of domestic abuse when a firearm is involved. Women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a gun, according to the  Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence  . The group also found that more than two-thirds of spouse and ex-spouse homicide victims over the last three decades were killed with firearms. Americans for Responsible Solutions and Everytown have led the charge over the last two years in battling the gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, to provoke reforms to gun safety laws at both the federal and state level. This week, gun control advocates renewed calls on US lawmakers to at the very least hold a debate, if not a vote, on legislative solutions that might curtail gun-related deaths and injuries. They were echoed by Barack Obama, who after the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, made gun reforms a cornerstone of his agenda only to be stymied by Republicans in Congress. “It breaks my heart every time you read or hear about these kids of incidents,” Obama said in  an interview  hours after Parker and Ward were killed. “What we know is that the number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism.” ••• Related:  Vester Flanagan: cameraman details 'rage' on assignment that led to job loss It has been more than two years since the US Senate failed to pass legislation designed to expand federal background checks, proposals made in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, in which 20 children and six educators were killed, as well as the gunman and his mother. Despite garnering the support of 90% of Americans, the bipartisan background checks bill was blocked by a Republican-led filibuster and not once revisited – even as high-profile mass shootings have continued to dominate headlines. Politicians who oppose new restrictions on guns have been quick to point out that the law could not have stopped  Vester Flanagan  from shooting his former colleagues, their interviewee and himself in Virginia. Although the state does have a massive loophole in its gun laws – no background checks are required for firearms purchased at gun shows – Flanagan bought his handgun legally after passing a background check. His mental instability became apparent after the killings, but he had no known history of psychiatric treatment. He had no record of criminal felonies and had no protective orders against him. A waiting period would also not have helped, because he bought his pistol two months before the shootings. But gun control advocates believe the shooting in Virginia is an exception to the rule. The majority of gun-related incidents, they have argued, could be prevented by proposals currently on the table, such as universal background checks, cracking down on the trafficking of firearms, or banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. “The idea of a background check was a really good idea yesterday, it was last month, it will be a good idea tomorrow no matter how the details of this particular idea unfold,” Colin Goddard, a survivor of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting and senior policy advocate for Everytown, told the Guardian. “We should do them on all sales. That is the single most effective way we could prevent a gun from getting into the wrong person’s hands in the first place.” With every incident, the gun reform movement gets the chance to gain another grieving relative with enough public capital to speak for the families of the other 616 families who died that week. This week, Alison Parker’s father, Andy Parker, announced it would be his life’s mission to push for change. “There has to be a way to force politicians that are cowards and in the pockets of the NRA to come to grips and have sensible laws so that crazy people can’t get guns,” Parker told CNN, the morning after the shooting. “It can’t be that hard.” An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter.

But I learned as an out-of-the-closet gay teen in south Georgia in the early 1980s that some bullies are just too big to fight. They’re too strong, too ruthless and insane, too well-connected with school administration or otherwise unfairly advantaged against those who would stand against them. It is then that one must resort to a tactic I like to call “Let’s you and him fight”. If you alone are not strong enough to vanquish your opponent, you must find someone who is – and then find a way to set them against each other. Neither, probably, will ever be your friend. However, once they have occupied each other’s attentions, one is generally once again at liberty to roam the school halls unmolested while dressed like Siouxsie Sioux’s sparkly kid brother. This tactic works beyond the cafeteria – and it’s how we as Americans should finally fight back against the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the other pro-gun lobbies keeping our country armed to the teeth and unwilling to hear any sense regarding gun safety laws, even as gun violence in the US remains disproportionately high: we must find something big, ugly and ruthless enough to take on the NRA. My friends, I must now utter a phrase that I would never have expected to say without having suffered an egregious head wound – something like “That was an Oscar-worthy performance from Steven Seagal,” or “I believe we’ve found another great French rock band”. Related: Another mass shooting, and yet again we're told: don't politicize, pray | Jeb Lund I believe the insurance industry may be our only hope. Let everyone in this country keep their guns, but force them to insure those guns. It seems so obvious when you think about it. We insure our cars, our houses, our boats and bodies, even our plane tickets and rental cars. And some of those policies are legally mandated. We should absolutely require gun owners to pay against the indemnity they might incur when their gun does what it is statistically most likely to do – kills or injures them, or someone else. Unlike all of the other things that we insure – cars, major electronics or art collections – guns only do one thing. They kill. They are lumps of metal that fire hot fragments of lead at lethal velocities in order to crack bone, explode soft tissues and end life. Gun violence costs the US an estimated $229bn every year . Insurance companies, do you hear that? That’s a lot of dosh you could be profiting from. Break out your actuary tables, let’s get indemnity-ed up! You see those guys over there, those NRA members? Each one of them is a walking, talking, gun-polishing wallet full of cash. How much do you suppose would be the maximum dollar amount of damage that could spew forth from the barrel of an AR-15 in one fiscal year? This could be your next great revenue stream, insurance giants. You might even make enough money to let Americans have something like decent, affordable healthcare.

Of course, they could always show up and shoot you (forcing you to pay yourself), but that’d hardly be a blip in the revenue stream. So, get in that ring, insurance guys. In this corner, we have the grifting, cheating, predatory insurance industry! In the opposite corner, the bullying, neurotic, paranoid but very, very heavily armed gun lobby! My money is on the bureaucrats. I believe the insurance companies with their legions of parsimonious bean-counters can accomplish in red tape what a million marching demonstrators with our signs and good intentions never could.

After a mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis on Thursday, Americans are once again confronting the country’s unique relationship with guns. Vox’s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration’s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. America is certainly an exceptional country when it comes to firearms. It’s one of the few countries in which the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected. But the relationship is unique in another crucial way: Among developed nations, the US is far and away the most homicidal — in large part due to the easy access many Americans have to firearms. These maps and charts show what that violence looks like compared with the rest of the world, why it happens, and why it’s such a tough problem to fix. This chart, compiled using 2012 United Nations data collected by Simon Rogers for the Guardian, shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. Why? Extensive reviews of the research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, suggest the answer is pretty simple: The US is an outlier on gun violence because it has way more guns than other developed nations. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms, based on 2018 data from the Small Arms Survey. In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been more than 2,500 mass shootings as of July 2020. The number comes from the Gun Violence Archive, which hosts a database that has tracked mass shootings since 2013. But since some shootings go unreported, the database is likely missing some, as well as the details of some of the events. The tracker uses a fairly broad definition of “mass shooting”: It includes not just shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter). Even under this broad definition, it’s worth noting that mass shootings make up less than 2 percent of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled nearly 40,000 in 2017 alone. Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue that it’s inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will just about never be the right time to discuss gun control, as Christopher Ingraham pointed out at the Washington Post in 2015. Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has around one mass shooting a day. So if lawmakers are forced to wait for a time when there isn’t a mass shooting to talk gun control, they could find themselves waiting for a very long time. Using data from a 2016 study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mother Jones put together the chart above that shows states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. This has been found across the empirical research: “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. Read more in Mother Jones’s “10 Pro-Gun Myths, Shot Down.” It would be one thing if the US happened to have more crime than other nations, but the existing data shows that not to be the case. America is only an outlier when it comes to homicides and, specifically, gun violence, based on 2000 data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University. As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. “A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry during an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. When economist Richard Florida took a look at gun deaths and other social indicators in 2011, he found that higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness didn’t correlate with more gun deaths. But he did find one telling correlation: States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. (Read more in Florida’s “The Geography of Gun Deaths.”) This is backed by other research: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. The good news is that firearm homicides, like all homicides and crime, have declined over the past several decades. There’s still a lot of debate among criminal justice experts about why this crime drop is occurring. Some of the most credible ideas include mass incarceration, more and better policing, and reduced lead exposure from gasoline. But one theory that researchers have widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime — in fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Center.  Although America’s political debate about guns tends to focus on grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, this is actually one of the most compelling reasons for reducing access to guns: There is a lot of research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the risk of suicide. Perhaps the key reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and poison. Jill Harkavy-Friedman, vice president of research for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, previously explained that this is why reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides: Just stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a huge difference. “Time is really key to preventing suicide in a suicidal person,” Harkavy-Friedman said. “First, the crisis won’t last, so it will seem less dire and less hopeless with time. Second, it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help. That’s why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful.” She added, “[I]f we keep the method of suicide away from a person when they consider it, in that moment they will not switch to another method. It doesn’t mean they never will. But in that moment, their thinking is very inflexible and rigid. So it’s not like they say, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to work. I’m going to try something else.’ They generally can’t adjust their thinking, and they don’t switch methods.” When countries reduced access to guns, they saw a drop in the number of firearm suicides. The data above, taken from a 2010 study by Australian researchers, shows that suicides dropped dramatically after the Australian government set up a mandatory gun buyback program that reduced the number of firearms in the country by about one-fifth. The Australian study found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant (in large part because murders in Australia were already so low). But the drop in suicides definitely was — and the results are striking. Australia is far from alone in these types of results. A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent when the military stopped letting soldiers take their guns home. The change was most pronounced during the weekends. This data and research have a clear message: States and countries can significantly reduce the number of suicides by restricting access to guns.  Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it isn’t too surprising that, as a 2015 study in the American Journal of Public Health found, states with more guns also have more police die in the line of duty. Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and homicides of police officers across the US over 15 years. They found that states with more gun ownership had more police killed in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15-year study period. The findings could help explain why US police officers appear to kill more people than police in other developed countries. For US police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence — even against them — in America mean that they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as a result. Over the past two decades, Americans have shifted from mostly supporting the concept of gun control to greater support for protecting “the right of Americans to own guns,” according to a 2017 Pew Research Center analysis of its surveys. This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have received more press attention. Although most Americans say they want to protect the right to own firearms, most also back many gun control proposals — such as stronger background checks, a database to track gun sales, and bans on assault-style weapons, according to Pew Research Center surveys. This type of contradiction isn’t exclusive to gun policy issues. For example, although most Americans in the past said they don’t like Obamacare, most of them also said they like the specific policies in the health care law. Americans just don’t like some policy ideas until you get specific. For people who believe the empirical evidence that more guns mean more violence, this contradiction is the source of a lot of frustration. Americans by and large support policies that reduce access to guns. But once these policies are proposed, they’re broadly spun by politicians and pundits into attempts to “take away your guns.” So nothing gets done, and preventable deaths keep occurring.

If Vice President Joe Biden became the next president, he could be tasked with fixing a problem he helped create: mass incarceration. Over the past few months, criminal and racial justice reformers have become more ingrained in presidential campaigns, tasking Democrats with turning back the tough-on-crime policies that ratcheted up mass incarceration and the war on drugs. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley have all been forced to address these issues on the campaign trail — in large part due to Black Lives Matter activists threatening or actually taking control of the candidates' speaking events. But Biden, who seems to be getting closer to entering the presidential race, ushered in many of the laws that created these problems — at least on the federal level — in the first place. During the 1980s and '90s, Biden sponsored laws that, for example, enacted federal mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and increased funding for US prisons. Biden now acknowledges his support for some of these laws was a mistake, particularly provisions that led to a huge disparity in crack and powder cocaine sentences. And supporters argue that Biden's record is much more nuanced than his critics would suggest, filled with what the vice president saw as compromises to get otherwise good ideas — such as the Violence Against Women Act — passed. That may be true, but it also may not matter much to Black Lives Matter activists and other criminal justice reformers. Sanders, who's widely perceived as more progressive than Biden (despite voting for the now-controversial 1994 anti-crime law), was interrupted by protesters in multiple rallies because of questions about his racial justice platform. Someone like Biden, who has a much longer record of supporting tough-on-crime policies that hurt black communities, will likely face even more pressure.  Reminder: The martial/incarceral state has had no greater friend in Washington over the last 35 years than Joe Biden. http://t.co/0pWJqMjtbE   As senator over the past three decades, Biden backed and even authored some of the major tough-on-crime laws that are now criticized for perpetuating racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Here are some examples, drawn in part from Jamelle Bouie's rundown at Slate: In short, Biden helped write and co-sponsored two of the most important pieces of legislation in the punitive war on drugs — the 1986 and 1988 laws — and helped create the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine. And he was at least partly behind other laws that perpetuated mass incarceration and increased police powers. Not exactly the kind of record Black Lives Matter is looking for. But Biden's supporters say attributing the effects of these laws entirely to him misses some of the nuance — and genuine shifts — in the vice president's stances over the decades. Joe Biden speaks at the Senate in 2008. To Biden's credit, he has eased his tough-on-crime stance over the past 30 years. In 2008, he backed the Second Chance Act, which provides monitoring and counseling services to former prison inmates. And in his last few years in the Senate, Biden began supporting the full elimination of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. (The disparity was reduced from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1 in 2010 with the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.) Biden said during a 2008 Senate hearing: Many have argued that this 100-to-1 disparity is arbitrary, unnecessary, and unjust, and I agree. And I might say at the outset in full disclosure, I am the guy that drafted this legislation years ago with a guy named Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was the Senator from New York at the time. And crack was new. It was a new ""epidemic"" that we were facing. And we had at that time extensive medical testimony talking about the particularly addictive nature of crack versus powder cocaine. And the school of thought was that we had to do everything we could to dissuade the use of crack cocaine. And so I am part of the problem that I have been trying to solve since then, because I think the disparity is way out of line. Biden's supporters also point out that he wasn't fully on board with some of the harsher measures in the 1994 law. For example, in a 1993 symposium sponsored by the US Sentencing Commission, Biden argued for undoing some mandatory minimums for drug offenses. ""I think we've had all the mandatory minimums that we need. We don't need the ones that we have,"" he said. ""But quite frankly, I don't think I will prevail… I've watched how the process works. I am not at all hopeful there will be [enough] senators prepared to vote with me."" This wasn't just talk, according to the vice president's office. The 1994 law ultimately included what's called a ""safety valve"" that allows a very limited number of low-level first-time drug offenders to avoid mandatory minimum sentences. This part of the 1994 law — along with the Violence Against Women Act, the 10-year ban on assault weapons, funding for firearm background checks, and grant programs for local and state police, which were all part of the 1994 measure — were some of the big-ticket items that led Biden to back the bill, even though he didn't support every part of it, Biden's office claimed. Biden even warned the New York Times in 1994 of a measure backed by the Clinton administration that required a life sentence for three-time violent offenders. Biden said, according to the Times, that it could have a potentially negative impact if states followed the federal government's lead and adopted their own punitive three-strikes laws. ""I think we've had all the mandatory minimums that we need. We don't need the ones that we have."" But Biden has seemed proud of the law, even some of its tough-on-crime measures, in the past. In Biden's 2008 presidential campaign website, his campaign called the 1994 law the ""Biden Crime Law."" And the website proudly touted a funding program in the law that encouraged states to effectively increase their prison sentences by paying them to build more prisons — a direct endorsement of more incarceration. Furthermore, one of the parts of the law Biden remains fairly proud of — grant programs for local and state police — produced mixed results. Some grants from the newly established COPS Office encouraged community policing, when police work closely with local communities to help establish their priorities. This is the kind of policing Biden has talked up in recent months — in which cops get out of the squad car and interact with local residents to encourage better communication. But, coupled with a spending boost for Byrne grants in the 1994 law, the COPS grants paid for larger police forces with outsize presences in black neighborhoods. This problem persisted for decades: Until 2014, Byrne grants rewarded police departments for making as many drug arrests as possible. As Neill Franklin, a retired Maryland police major who's now executive director of the anti-drug-war Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, previously told me, this created a perverse incentive for cops to focus on poor black communities: One of the requirements for completing a federal grant application for funds to combat drugs was showing how many drug arrests we made. The thinking was that the more drug arrests you have, the more significant your drug problem. If you have a significant drug problem, the federal government will give you more funds. So what did we do? We had our officers go out and make as many drug arrests as they could. Where did we do that? We did that in communities of color. Yes, it was that easy. Most of the people in these impoverished communities are always in the streets. They sell on the street corner. They have no political power or capital and no financial power, so there's also very little pushback. Doing these evening and afternoon sweeps meant 20 to 30 arrests, and now you have some great numbers for your grant application. Joe Biden speaks at a press conference following a mass shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Jason Davis/Getty Images Biden's supporters argue that the 1980s and '90s were completely different times. Plagued by high crime and drug use rates, the public pressured lawmakers to do something to fight crime — and that led to the tough-on-crime laws that Biden and other legislators backed. But what if crime begins to go up again after its decades-long decline? If Biden didn't fight the conservative instinct to be tough on crime before, it's possible he would be unable to do it the next time around. Still, Biden seems better positioned to argue that he genuinely understands some of the concerns compared with other Democrats in the race. O'Malley, for example, pushed tough-on-crime policies as mayor in Baltimore less than a decade ago. And Clinton, who lobbied for the 1994 law on behalf of her husband, has only recently started apologizing for its effects. Biden, at least, is on record stating his regrets and concerns with tough-on-crime policies through the 1990s and 2000s. The question is whether that would be enough to satisfy Black Lives Matter activists if Biden entered the race.  Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?

144,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/08/why-has-america-done-so-little-to-stop-gun-violence/,"The murder of two journalists in Virginia, live on TV, by a disgruntled co-worker who later shot himself, has once again sparked debates about gun legislation in the US, with the White House calling for action by Congress. The tragedy happened a few days after an American researcher in criminal justice, Adam Lankford, released results of a global study of incidents involving 292 mass killers between 1966 and 2012. By way of definition, the murders in Virginia would not actually have made the survey as there were three victims – including the perpetrator himself – and the FBI determines a killing to be “mass” when it involves four or more deaths. While the US is not the only country to experience the problem of mass shootings – Lankford’s data came from 171 countries – it is certainly way out in the lead with 90 incidents. Only four other countries made it into double figures, as the graph below shows.  Britain has had three – Hungerford in 1987, Dunblane in 1996 and Cumbria in 2010. The US does not even have the most murderous mass shooting, that dubious distinction goes to Norway where Anders Breivik gunned down 69 young people at a summer camp outside Oslo in 2011. Despite the global manifestation of mass shootings, they are frequently seen as a distinctly American phenomenon. The flipside of the American Dream, as it were, is the gun crazy nightmare and the instant “dark celebrity” that running amok with a firearm can achieve. And to understand that, argues Lankford, we have to understand the American gun culture, and the values that surround it. America certainly leads the world in terms of its rate of gun ownership with almost 90 guns for every 100 people. The proportion of gun owners in the USA is falling, now around 35% – except among Republican leaning voters. Gun owners now tend to own more guns than they used to, choosing to augment their personal firepower as newer guns (military specification semi-automatic pistols and assault rifles) become available.   Globally, gun ownership is still a male preserve and the Geneva based Small Arms Survey project estimates that 96% of guns owners in the world are men. If anything, the US is slightly more equal, with 12% of women claiming to be gun owners. Revealingly, Lankford’s survey finds only one mass killing perpetrated by a woman – the 2006 murder of six postal workers in California by Jennifer San Marco. Some research suggests that shooters specifically target women and girls as a form of violent abusive entitlement. Clearly, as Lankford points out in his research, the risk of mass shootings is more likely in a society in which the private ownership of firearms is common as opposed to one where it is relatively rare. But rare events are incredibly difficult to predict. A particular kind of competitive individualistic culture may produce large numbers of embittered loners and losers bearing grudges and seeking revenge against former schools, employers, girlfriends, bullying classmates – all of which feature prominently in the diaries and social media epitaphs of perpetrators. But if these individuals can’t access firearms, they can’t undertake their outrages. The real breakthrough in understanding came when better global data began to be produced of the relations between rates of gun ownership and gun violence from the late 1990s onwards. Before then, the US was the only real source of such data, although research into the impact of guns in the US has continued to be blocked by the gun lobby. More recent evidence shows a much clearer connection between rates of gun ownership and rates of gun homicide. Lankford’s study comes to a similar conclusion: But the numbers are not the whole story: culture is important. There are relatively controlled “gun cultures” as well as decontrolled and dangerous ones, where you can legally purchase a lethal weapon from a total stranger in a car park, well below the radar of the authorities. Some 40% of US gun sales are thought to be “off the books” in this fashion. It also matters what kinds of guns you have in your possession. Commentators have been noting that US rampage killings have lately become more frequent and more murderous, pointing to the contribution of assault rifles and large magazine capacity semi-automatics, which are now fairly widespread in civilian ownership. The timeline below shows mass shootings with more than 12 victims between 1945 and 2013.   There is something even more uncomfortable about this too. A mass shooting, especially of children, can galvanise opinion into action much more than other types of violence. So 20, five-year-old white children, killed in a school in a single day can mobilise opinion more than the fact of many more African American kids being killed every month. The real “American exceptionalism” is not that it has had so many mass shootings, but rather that it has done so little about them.

An announcement on the Florida Gun Supply website stated that Zimmerman and owner Andy Hallinan would be splitting the proceeds from selling the $50 prints for ""legal funds, living expenses, and advancing their mission to change the country."" According to the site, Zimmerman, who was found not guilty in 2013 in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, offered to donate the prints after hearing about the Council of American Islamic Relations' lawsuit against Halling for banning Muslims from entering the establishment. ""I didn't want to see you give up the fight simply for financial reasons,"" Zimmerman tells Hallinan in a ""mini-documentary"" posted by the store on Monday. ""[CAIR has] endless resources, they have tons of money. I just wanted to do my part."" Hallinan originally attracted criticism after announcing his anti-Muslim stance in another video, saying he wanted to ensure the safety ""all patriots in my community"" following the mass shooting attack against a church in Charleston, South Carolina. However, he did not mention at the time that the shooting was committed by a white person, Dylann Roof, who wore the flag on a jacket. The store's website alluded to this in its announcement, denying that the Confederate battle flag itself is racist, while stating that it ""HAS been used by a small amount of people to incite racism, however, it has not become a symbol of racism. You cannot assume everyone who flies a Confederate Flag is racist in the same way that you cannot judge every Muslim to be a terrorist, or every gun owner to be a serial killer."" The site did not mention that the Confederacy's vice-president Alexander Stephens, defended fighting the Civil War in order to protect the Southern slave industry, arguing it to be a ""great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man.""

""These conversations should be had as soon as innocent people die as a result of our lax gun laws. It's that simple,"" she said. ""Anyone who thinks that it's 'politicizing it,' you need to shut the f*ck up and go mind your own goddamn business, because obviously, that's the perfect time to have that kind of discussion."" ""I'm glad they didn't politicize 9/11,"" co-host Jimmy Dore added sarcastically. ""We didn't go into Afghanistan for months, so they really waited a long time."" Partisan politics, Kasparian argued, begin playing a role in the aftermath of any mass shooting -- most recently the deaths of WDBJ-TV journalists Adam Ward and Alison Parker last week at the hands of a disgrunted ex-coworker during a live broadcast, which has become a springboard for Parker's father, Andy Parker, to call for lawmakers to be pressured into taking tougher stances on gun safety. ""You'll have the pro-gun advocates who say, 'No no no, don't use this very, very public, terrible, tragic event as a way of pushing for gun reform,'"" she said. ""And then you'll have people who are in favor of some form of gun control coming out and saying, 'Look, we should use this as a lesson, and we should use this as a way to strengthen any kind of gun control policy that we are even considering.'"" But only the people pushing for tighter gun safety statutes, she continued, are accused of ""politicizing"" the issue. ""So what is this man doing right now?"" she asked, referring to Parker. ""Is he politicizing a tragic event? No, he's speaking common sense about a serious problem that we deal with every single day in this country."" Watch the discussion, as aired on Monday, below.

147,http://www.rawstory.com/2015/08/i-dream-about-it-every-night-what-happens-to-the-people-who-film-police-violence/,"Feidin Santana relives the morning of Saturday 4 April 2015 on a near continuous loop. It was around 9.30am and the 23-year-old was running uncharacteristically late for work. As he walked his usual route through the back streets of North Charleston, something caught his eye: a black man running away from a white police officer. Santana followed the chase for a few yards to a deserted patch of lawn behind a pawn shop and a car dealership. Here the officer caught up with the man, and ended up on top of him. Watching from behind a chainlink fence, Santana instinctively reached for his phone and pressed record. The morning was still, silent. “You could hear birds flying, the swing of their wings,” Santana says as he stands, three months later, where he was that day. “You could hear everything; the sounds of the officer, the gunshots. Everything.” Santana had hoped he might be noticed. “I believed my presence would prevent something,” he says softly, his voice almost drowned by the hum of cicadas. “But it didn’t happen that way.” Instead, Santana’s steady hand captured the moment the unarmed, 50-year-old man,  Walter Scott  , broke away from the officer, Michael Slager, and attempted to flee. The officer paused for a moment, pointed his gun and fired about eight rounds until Scott lay face down on the ground. “Everything happened too fast,” Santana says. “I never imagined he’d pull his gun out. There was no way out. He [Scott] was running slow.” In the grainy footage, Slager can be seen opening fire, then walking over to Scott’s body, yanking his floppy arms and placing them in handcuffs. “Oh shit,” Santana can be heard whispering, as he follows the officer. Slager jogs back to the site he fired from, picks up an object from the floor – perhaps his Taser – and drops it next to the body as another officer arrives. “Fucking abuse,” Santana mutters. The two officers gaze down on Scott’s corpse, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being filmed. Santana moves right up to the fence as Slager places his finger on Scott’s neck, checking for a pulse. The grassy patch where Scott fell is peaceful now. Memorials have been removed, and Santana looks at the ground, hands in his pockets, his lean body framed by the fence he filmed through just a few months earlier. “This is the place where everything changed,” the Dominican migrant says. Once Santana’s footage went public, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Santana’s split-second decision that day marked a turning point in a new civil rights movement in the US, one born on the streets of  Ferguson  , Missouri, in August 2014. Then, it was 18-year-old  Michael Brown who was fatally shot  by officer Darren Wilson. The final few minutes of Brown’s life had been captured by a small surveillance camera rolling inside a nearby grocery shop, where Brown had stolen a box of cigars before walking out with a friend. After the shooting, one of his neighbours used his phone to film Brown’s bloodied body lying in the road. “They said he had his hands up and everything,” the young man was recorded saying, as a crowd gathered in the midday sun. But the violent 90-second encounter between these two recordings, which would unleash months of civil unrest on America’s streets and return a dispute over race and criminal justice to the forefront of its politics, somehow eluded phone cameras. “I just wish we could have had solid proof,” says Leslie McSpadden, Brown’s uncle. As protesters have taken to the streets to demonstrate over Brown’s death,  even a year on  , so a legion of amateur cameramen and women have begun watching officers closely, posting recordings that undermine the monopoly once held by police on the official version of events. Footage of fatal encounters with police has already helped secure murder charges, not just against Slager but also against an officer in Baltimore, Maryland, who drove the police van in which  Freddie Gray  , a black 25-year-old, suffered fatal injuries in April – apparently contradicting official narratives filed by officers. A white police officer lost his job within days of being filmed  aggressively handling teenagers outside a pool party  in Texas in June. The case was cited as proof of what campaigners argue is a policing system sharply biased against African Americans, sometimes with deadly consequences. But the surge in vigilante recording is being met with aggressive resistance from police. Judges uphold the right of American people to film law enforcement officers under the first amendment of the US constitution, and lawmakers in several states have proposed new laws specifically protecting such recording. But officers increasingly complain that filming interferes with their duties, and insist that short clips don’t tell the full story of controversial encounters. An increasing number are taking direct action to prevent recordings – snatching or smashing phones or demanding the handover of footage, sometimes even after it has been livestreamed directly online. For many who capture horrific acts of violence, returning to a normal life becomes impossible. They complain of harassment by police, of threats against their life and of recurring trauma as a result of the death and brutality they have witnessed. *** In the barber shop where he works, in a dusty strip mall by a motorway, Santana is friendly, relaxed. But walking to the site where Scott was killed, his mood shifts; he talks slowly, pausing and casting his eyes into the distance. “I try not to come back here,” he says. “But you cannot ignore your fears. Sometimes I cross by. I look at the video and I see myself, how everything happened.” Santana migrated to America with his family 10 years ago, at 13. Like many who come to the US from Latin America, he arrived without a word of English, in pursuit of a better life. He has, he says, lived a “nomadic existence”, moving from city to city in his late teens; spending a short time back in the Dominican Republic, playing shortstop in the baseball  Prospect League  , hoping to be scouted by a major league club in the US. But he injured his shoulder and moved alone to North Charleston in 2013 to start a career as a barber, sending money back home to his wife and one-year-old son. He describes himself as someone who “gets along with everybody”. But adds, “I’m a person who doesn’t like injustice.” It was this that informed his decision to follow Scott and Slager that day, and guided his actions after he turned the camera off. As officers began to swarm around Scott’s body, Santana shouted and told one he had witnessed the entire event. “I told him what happened was an abuse, and that I had it on record,” he recalls. The officer told him to stay where he was but then, inexplicably, he was allowed to leave the crime scene. He feared officers might seize his phone and the footage would be lost for ever, so he took flight. “I just left, right in front of their eyes. They didn’t try to stop me. I don’t know why.” He wasn’t certain if the film had saved and as he ran to the barber’s shop he looked back at his handset. The footage was there. “I couldn’t believe it recorded… I got nervous, I tried to send it to another phone.” But he quickly decided against sharing it with anyone, worried about how it might be handled. The gravity of what he had just witnessed began to sink in. At this point, Santana’s close friend Tawayne Weems walked into the barber’s shop. Weems, 43, is assistant principal at the local high school. An African American who speaks fluent Spanish, he met Santana when he first moved to North Charleston. Weems quickly became a father figure to him, helping him establish himself in a city where he had no family. But on that day back in April, the two had not seen each other in months. Weems had popped by to get a haircut, and describes the moment he saw the footage: “We went outside, he showed it to me in the car. I knew this was on the precipice of something big, that could really change things,” he says. “But initially I didn’t want to get involved.” The two watched the news that afternoon, which led with a story on Scott’s death. To their shock, the reports reproduced the official lie: that Scott had been shot after he grabbed Slager’s Taser and the officer feared for his life. “Then it was like, well, we got to say something,” Weems says. They vowed to get the video to Scott’s family. Santana later shared a copy with his wife in the Dominican Republic, under strict instructions that if anything were to happen to him, she should send it only to Weems. He feared for his life: “You’re scared of who you’re dealing with. You know it’s law enforcement, who are meant to be doing their job, but then they’re saying the opposite of what you saw. It goes through your mind… what could happen next? I’m the only one with the evidence.” That evening Santana contacted a local protester who had led a rally in support of the Scott family, sending him a screenshot of his footage over Facebook. The next afternoon, at a vigil, the activist introduced him to Scott’s brother, Anthony. As Santana played the video from his phone, Anthony broke down in tears. But still Santana held on to it: he wanted his own attorney in place before he handed it over on Monday. By Tuesday evening,  the video  was playing on every US news channel and, later, around the world. Santana stood in the barber shop and watched a press conference held by North Charleston’s mayor, who announced that Slager had been charged with murder. Then Santana heard the question he’d been dreading: a journalist asked who had filmed the video. “That’s when I really got scared. When something you have done is on national TV, worldwide TV,” he says, “you have to live through that to understand it.” *** It is a fear that Ramsey Orta, a New York City resident and also 23, understands only too well. Orta filmed the death of  Eric Garner  ,  capturing the moment  the 43-year-old was placed in a banned chokehold by an NYPD officer and uttered his last words: “I can’t breathe.” Lawyers Ken Perry and William Aronin sit in the poky downtown Manhattan apartment that serves as their office. The pair, separated in age by over three decades, make up Orta’s legal team. “We don’t discuss where Ramsey is now, for obvious reasons, other than to say he is in the city and with family,” says Aronin, 31. Orta no longer gives interviews and will not disclose his location. “I’m still happy I took the video,” he said in a statement via his lawyers. “I just wish I was able to keep my name out of it.” Orta had a criminal past before the Garner incident, including convictions for drugs sales and possession of stolen property. But since the video emerged a year ago, he has endured three stints in New York’s notorious  Rikers Island jail  . His lawyers argue that he has been the subject of a targeted campaign at the hands of the NYPD. They list what they claim are deficiencies in the criminal cases pending against their client, which consist of two recent drug dealing charges and a weapons possession charge that occurred just two weeks after the Garner video emerged. “He’s basically a whistleblower,” Aronin says. “Two weeks after he blows the whistle on horrific police abuse, the police just happen to find him waving a gun in plain sight. It’s ridiculous.” Perry argues that the DNA evidence on the gun charge is inconclusive, and says of video evidence turned over in Orta’s first drugs case, “You can’t see shit, you can’t hear shit.” The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment about the pending cases, but Orta is due to stand trial later in the year. *** Orta is not the only witness to have gone to ground.  Kevin Moore  filmed the moment 25-year-old  Freddie Gray  was bundled into the back of a police van in Baltimore, minutes before he sustained a horrific spinal injury that later killed him. Moore, 28, was arrested days after Gray’s death, after a protest in the city. He was released without charge, but described the incident as a deliberate act of intimidation. He has not been heard from in weeks, according to local activists. Perhaps unsurprisingly, leading law enforcement figures have tried to play down the legitimacy of these clips.  Bill Bratton  , New York’s veteran police commissioner, accuses activists of exploiting a handful of regrettable cases “to try to define American policing”. With physical altercations, he says, “It’s lawful – but it looks awful.” Earlier this year,  Jason Villalba  , a Republican representative in the Texas legislature, became the latest US politician to propose new laws banning people from filming police. Until last year, recording officers in Illinois without permission was a felony crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Efforts during the last legislative sessions to pass laws protecting the right to film failed in Connecticut, Mississippi and Montana. But a steadily growing weight of opinion holds that filming the police is legal. Courts in Illinois and Massachusetts have ruled that filming is protected by the first amendment of the US constitution, and the US supreme court declined in 2012 to consider an appeal against the Massachusetts decision, meaning the nation’s highest court turned down an opportunity to restrict filming across the country. Villalba withdrew his bill amid a crescendo of criticism just days after the emergence of Santana’s footage in South Carolina, and laws protecting filmers were enacted during the last sessions in Arkansas, Colorado and Oregon. But Ron Hosko, a former senior FBI official, cautions that a black hand-held phone could easily be mistaken for a gun by police officers having to make split-second decisions under intense pressure. “This is not a time to be engaged in a frolic,” he says. “The police sometimes shoot and kill people who turn out not to have something.” Chuck Canterbury  , national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, adds that filming often hinders officers trying to do their jobs. “People are interfering by getting much too close,” he says. Both Hosko and Canterbury claim many clips are misleadingly edited. They decry the treatment of  Eric Casebolt  , the police officer who resigned amid widespread criticism after he was filmed manhandling a black girl and pointing his gun at two black boys outside a pool party in McKinney, a Dallas suburb. The footage, recorded on a mobile phone by a 15-year-old, dominated the national media after sweeping across the internet. “You only get what the person who filmed it wants you to see,” Canterbury says of amateur footage. “The McKinney video did not show the facilitating incident, the fights taking place, the residents who were demanding police action.” “One thing is for sure in America,” Hosko says of the two unarmed boys who approached Casebolt before he drew his weapon. “You’re rolling up to a potential gun fight, because at least one person has a gun. You may have a gun in your face.” Both men support efforts to restrict filming to a set distance away from officers, or to outlaw interference with police fulfilling their duties. *** When  Mekkel Richards and Adam Malinowski  saw eight police officers pushing a man to the ground and beating him in downtown Detroit one evening last summer, both reached for their phones. The two students had been walking back from a fireworks display. Standing three metres apart, they watched the scene as their digital cameras rolled, blood seeping from the man’s head. “That’s when I realised that what we’ve all read about and seen on the TV about police brutality is real, and not a rarity,” says Richards, who is 23. Soon they were spotted. “Get the fuck back,” Richards says one officer told him. “Put your phone away, you can’t be videotaping,” said another. One pushed him to the ground, he says, and when he stood up, another officer punched him in the face. Realising Malinowski was recording this, too, the officer ran towards him and placed him in a headlock before slamming him to the ground and handcuffing him, he alleges. The officers smashed Malinowski’s iPhone and erased recordings on Richards’s device, the pair say. “I’ve never felt as threatened as I did that day,” Malinowski says. They were arrested, charged with interfering and had to spend the night in cells. They  claim  one officer told them they were “faggot tree huggers that take the whole rights thing too seriously”. Malinowski had his case dismissed following probation. The case against Richards was dismissed when police did not turn up to court. The two men recently filed a lawsuit accusing the officers and their city bosses of assault, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and violating their constitutional rights. “It’s unfortunate the only way to hold police accountable legally for this is to sue them for money,” says Malinowski, who is now 22. Their case was the most violent in a series of recent confrontations, according to  Carlos Miller  , a former journalist who now tracks the issue on his website,  Photography Is Not A Crime  . Already this year, the site has reported on 87 cases in which people were arrested, manhandled or threatened for filming police. The rate of such incidents has increased in recent years, Miller says. “It’s great we have all these laws, but the battle continues. We’re not going to back down, and nor are they.” In June,  an officer in Austin, Texas  , was filmed snatching the phone of a man recording the police, then pepper-spraying him. The previous month  in North Carolina, a man was arrested  and charged with interfering while filming his friend being arrested. “How do you stop your phone?” an officer can be heard asking on his footage. In March in New Jersey,  Phillip White was filmed  being mauled by a police dog, in an incident that led to his death. One officer approached the bystander who had been recording and, after confirming he had captured the entire thing, told him: “I’m going to take your phone.” The footage was later obtained by a local TV news station. In a bid to counter the backlash from officers, a number of developers have created automatic mobile video upload software.  One such app, released by the New York Civil Liberties Union  in 2012, at the height of the NYPD’s use of “stop and frisk”, sends recorded footage straight to a legal observer at the union, effectively safeguarding recordings before they can be deleted. It has been downloaded by 35,000 city residents and tens of thousands of submissions have been received. The videos, says Jennifer Carnig, a spokeswoman for the NYCLU, provided an unprecedented insight into discriminatory policing under stop and frisk: verbal and physical abuse, heavy-handed searches and the drawing of weapons on people who appear to be unarmed. The app also revealed new methods officers are using to stop bystanders filming them, for example by shining torches or the high beams of their patrol cars into the camera lens. The “mobile justice” app has now been rolled out in seven other states, including California, where more than 150,000 people have downloaded it. It has yet to bring about any litigation, Carnig says, “but I think what we have gotten is this public conversation”. Just as it became the centre of the new protest movement, so Ferguson has become a flashpoint for this intensifying clash between law enforcement officers and those who film them. Several photographers and livestreamers, who broadcast direct to the web, were arrested along with reporters during the weeks of protests that followed Brown’s death last August. Last weekend, a demonstration to mark the anniversary of his death ended in violence,  much of it filmed  . In  a report published earlier this year  on its investigation into the Ferguson police department, the US Department of Justice found that the city’s officers “routinely infringe on the public’s first amendment rights by preventing people from recording their activities” and cite safety concerns to do so “without any factual support”. One prominent livestreamer,  Heather De Mian  , was arrested after being knocked from her wheelchair – by a police officer, she alleges – at a demonstration outside the Ferguson police station in February, to mark six months since Brown’s shooting. “I was on the ground, the cops stole my phone and then I was knocked in the face and was just kind of stunned,” says De Mian, 45. “My glasses were knocked into the street and I couldn’t see.” While one officer wheeled her chair inside the station, another loaded her into an SUV. She was taken inside and eventually charged with assaulting a police officer. She insists she has no idea what she is supposed to have done. “If I tried to hit somebody, I would dislocate something,” said De Mian, who has  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  , a disorder of the body’s connective tissue. De Mian got into livestreaming when her BlackBerry was knocked from her hand as she photographed riot police at a demonstration following the acquittal in July 2013 of  George Zimmerman  , from criminal charges over his killing of  Trayvon Martin  , a black 17-year-old, in Florida. She was eventually sentenced to 20 hours of community service for failure to obey a reasonable police order, after not dispersing when police declared the assembly illegal. During the months of protests in Ferguson, she captured police pepper-spraying and tear-gassing crowds, and roughly snatching people for arrest in targeted raids. While the cable news cameras stayed back, she broadcast direct from the frontlines, sending images of the chaotic clashes to laptops all over the world. The Obama administration’s view on those who have filmed in Ferguson is unambiguous. “As the ability to record police activity has become more widespread,” said the Department of Justice report, “the role it can play in capturing questionable police activity, and ensuring that the activity is investigated and subject to broad public debate, has become clear.” *** At  Scott’s funeral  , a week after his death, hundreds lined up in the rain to pay their final respects. They swayed in time as a soloist sang rousing gospel, then bowed their heads in prayer. Pastor George D Hamilton delivered a sermon, describing Santana’s actions as the will of God: that he was able to “video every detail so no man could question the guilt of that murderer”. As Scott’s body lay surrounded by flowers, Hamilton’s advice to the congregation was clear: “Keep your phone handy, keep your charge up. You never know when you need to be around.” Santana was not present at the funeral, but he was there when South Carolina’s governor signed the first statewide  law requiring law enforcement officers to wear body cameras  . It was pushed through in the wake of the Scott incident and would not have happened without Santana’s footage. As Santana prods at his dinner, he hints at the stress that has continued since his brief exposure in the media and ahead of a likely appearance as a witness in  Slager’s murder trial  . He moved from his home, close to the site of the shooting, after it happened. Now he moves between locations, “to be safe, to be around people you know care”. “It is something you can’t ignore, something you can’t erase,” he says of Scott’s death. “I dream about this, the same thing every single night.” He talks of the paranoia that arose after  the mass shooting  two months after Scott’s death at a black church in Charleston, a few miles away, where a 21-year-old white supremacist is accused of murdering nine parishioners at a prayer service. “There are many things in this state that I didn’t know the real face of,” he says. “After those threats, it shows you.” There is a Death to Feidin Santana Facebook group that proclaims, “He put a good man behind bars!” Has he received any direct threats? Santana pauses and drops his eyes. “A little bit of everything, that’s all I can say. I used to work from eight in the morning until 11 at night. Now I can’t. I don’t feel comfortable staying in the barber shop. It’s not the same. I used to be there by myself, now I have to be surrounded by people.” Yet he has no regrets and shrugs at the suggestion that his acts were heroic. “I believe we are here to be each other’s keepers, to protect each other. I don’t see anything special in what I did.” guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2015 An unindicted co-conspirator involved in the Proud Boys' planning for the Jan. 6 gathering that led to the siege of the US Capitol is Aaron Whallon-Wolkind, the former vice president of the nationalistic pro-Trump street gang's Philadelphia chapter. Whallon-Wolkind's identity as the unindicted co-conspirator was first reported by Alan Feuer, a reporter for the New York Times, on Twitter on Thursday. A knowledgeable source speaking on condition of anonymity provided the same information to Raw Story.                    No investigative story ever really ends. If you don't believe me, here's an example from my own reporting days.                                 Although former President Donald Trump was decisively voted out of office in 2020 and has been gone from the White House for almost six months, he continues to be the most influential figure in the Republican Party. Countless GOP politicians are afraid to publicly say a word against him, and his MAGA rallies still attract unquestioning, cult-like followers. Wall Street Journal reporter Michael C. Bender examines the type of MAGA devotees who faithfully attend those rallies in an excerpt from his book, ""Frankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost."" The Washington Post published an excerpt from the book this week, and in the excerpt, Bender discusses a ""group of Trump's most hardcore rallygoers"" known as the Front Row Joes.
